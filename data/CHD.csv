"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition for animal dross and its method of use. More particularly, the present invention relates to a litter that displays colored speckles without being color transferable.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owner had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. House-broken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added absorbent materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The dross-soiled absorbent must be regularly cleaned to maintain a hygienic environment and to thwart the emission of objectionable odors from the presence of the urine and fecal matter in the litter. Removal of fecal matter from any litter is somewhat easy as they are generally solid objects that can be physically removed from the litter. However, physical removal of the feces does not address the issues of removing liquid dross from the litter nor does it help reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Thus it can be said that the removal of the liquid dross from the litter is harder to execute.

Though the absorbent material aids in absorbing liquid dross, removal of the liquid dross and identification of the liquid dross in the litter is still difficult. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, will eventually have to be replaced.

Currently clumping clays and other water absorbent material are used to improve litter compositions. An improved composition for animal litters uses the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral in the montmorillonite clay family. These water absorbent materials not only absorb liquid dross, but they aid in the identification of used litter from unused litter portions. These water absorbent materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine thus facilitating the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter. The wetted clump has the ability to group into a size substantially larger than the individual particles comprising the litter.

Though these improved compositions have eased the owners' task of removing soiled litter portions, they are still short of addressing problems associated with the burial or splitting of the clumped dross. The buried or split clump, if not timely discovered, will emit offensive odors within a relatively short period of time. Thus when the clumped dross is buried or split the homeowner must still either patiently sift through the litter to remove the used portions or simply discard the partially soiled litter. As a result the benefits of having a clumped litter diminishes since the removal of the clumped dross once again becomes a time-consuming as well as costly process.

The following prior art references illustrate aspects of the technology of animal litter preparation, and, in particular, disclose the use of clays in such litters.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,420 issued Aug. 11, 1987 to Stuart, discloses an animal litter composition comprising a water-absorbing polymer such as a polyacrylate combined with a porous inert solid substrate such as clay.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,115 issued Mar. 19, 1991 to Hughes, discloses the use of a water swellable bentonite clay as an absorbent litter material. The clay absorbs the liquids in animal waste which on contacting the clay agglomerates it into a stable mass easily separated from the unwetted and unsoiled portion of the composition.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,532 issued Dec. 7, 1993 to Franklin, et al., discloses a pH-indicating material maintained on an inert carrier that is separate from the cat litter material. The pH-indicating material has dual indicators that provide one color transition at a low pH and a different color transition at a high pH so that acidic or alkaline animal urine problems can be visibly detected upon contact between the animal urine and the pH-indicating material. The pH-indicating material is water and urine soluble and easily transferable.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,054 issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Pluta, et al., discloses an animal litter composition used to diagnose animal health problems. The composition comprises at least one uncalcined clay substrate having a calcium oxide content of less than about 5% by weight and wherein the clay mineral component of said substrate has a attapulgite content of at least about 35% by weight, in combination with at least one chemical pH indicator. All pH indicators are water soluble and easily transferable.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,233 issued Sep. 16, 2003 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,763,783 issued Jul. 20, 2004 both to Mochizuki, disclose a granulated-type, urine-discharge processing material for animals that discriminates between before-use and after-use. The material comprises a water absorbent granular body dyed with water soluble dyes or a water absorbent granular body containing powder of water soluble dyes (which will make it color transferable), and a water absorbent surface layer covering a surface of the water absorbent granular body. The water absorbent surface layer and the water absorbent granular body are bonded to each other through a non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer formed of a plurality of adhesive non-coated parts and a plurality of adhesive coated parts which is coated on the surface of the water absorbent granular body. Discharged animal urine is permeated into the water absorbent granular body through the water absorbent surface layer and the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer, or by dissolving the adhesive coated parts. Thereby, the water soluble dyes are eluted into the discharged urine so that the water absorbent surface layer is dyed through the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer. The water absorbent granular body is chiefly composed of vegetable fiber or vegetable powder and contains inorganic fillers. The water absorbent granular body further contains powder of a water absorbent polymer so that the granular body can have rich water absorbing and retaining properties. No mention is made to clays in the patent.

Color-indicating litters are the most recent advance in litters, however, use of these litters are still problematic. Despite the common problem of tracking the litter in the home, these color-indicating litters may not only be tracked inside the home, but can discolor home furnishings such as carpets, couches and the like, making a small problem even worse. A need exists for a litter that imparts a color but will not bleed into home furnishings even if tracked by the pet through the home.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A non-color transferable animal litter is disclosed that contains painted particulate material and non-painted water absorbent material. The absorbent material may be any clumping or non-clumping material known in the art. Once painted, the particles are colorfast and do not interfere with the function of the non-painted water absorbent materials. The painted particles are colorfast, non-water soluble and impart a speckled appearance to the litter.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of toothbrushes, and more particularly, the invention relates to the field of electrically powered toothbrushes, and actuators and packaging therefor.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Electric toothbrushes typically utilize a switch accessible along the exterior or body of the toothbrush that controls operation of the toothbrush. Generally, such switches have two positions, one position in which the toothbrush is not operating or “off” and another position in which the toothbrush is activated or “on.” Generally, these switches are slidable or otherwise linearly displaceable between these two positions. Such position switches have also been modified to also activate their corresponding circuits or mechanisms upon being pushed or depressed. This pushbutton feature may be provided in combination with the previously noted linear position function in a single switch.

Most consumer goods and particularly those that relate to health and beauty are packaged in retail-friendly display cartons such that the product that is being sold may be readily viewed by a consumer contemplating its purchase. Such packaging is currently used for many different brands and models of commercially available electric toothbrushes.

Multi-motion electric toothbrushes are known which are believed to provide superior cleaning efficacy. These toothbrushes often provide multiple brushing motions by two or more brush heads. In addition to the superior cleaning action, the operation of the brush and complex motion of the brush heads often generates interest in a potential purchaser of the toothbrush. That is, many consumers find the operation of the brush to be interesting to watch.

As a result of this phenomenon, the assignee of the present invention previously developed a package for an electric toothbrush that was adapted for retail display and enabled a consumer to activate the toothbrush while sealed within the package. Accordingly, an interested consumer could simply activate a packaged toothbrush by pushing the switch of the toothbrush through its packaging. Some such arrangements are shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,311,837; 6,189,693; and 6,178,579, the substances of which are incorporated herein by reference.

A significant problem with such consumer friendly packaging is that the toothbrush may accidentally be activated during shipment or storage. Furthermore, it is neither practical nor economical to include actuation interlocks in the packaging or to somehow “arm” or selectively enable actuation of the toothbrush prior to retail display.

Accordingly, there is a significant need for an electric toothbrush that may utilize current retail packaging approaches and may be activated after packaging, yet which would not be prone to accidental or unintended activation particularly while in its package.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention achieves all of the foregoing objectives and provides, in a first aspect, a packaged electric toothbrush comprising a package having a cover, a back, and a cavity defined therebetween. The package cover includes a projection that extends from an interior face of the cover. The packaged toothbrush also comprises an electric toothbrush disposed within the cavity of the package. The toothbrush includes a housing, a neck, and a head. The housing has a motor and a power source for energizing the motor. The motor is engaged with a movable bristle holder disposed on the head. The electric toothbrush also includes a first movable member which may be moved between two positions. The electric toothbrush is energized when the movable member is in the second position. The first movable member has a second movable member that is slideably disposed within the first member. The second movable member is movable in a direction that is substantially perpendicular to the direction of movement of the first movable member. The second movable member is positioned adjacent the projection extending from the interior face of the cover. The electric toothbrush may also be energized by applying a force upon the package cover near the projection to thereby cause the projection to contact and depress the second movable member when the first movable member is in its first position.

In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a packaged electric toothbrush comprising a package having a cover that defines a hollow interior within the package. The cover has an outwardly directed outer face and an oppositely directed inner face. The inner face has a projection extending from the inner face into the hollow interior of the package. The packaged electric toothbrush also comprises an electric toothbrush disposed within the hollow interior of the package. The toothbrush includes an actuator assembly positioned adjacent the projection of the cover. The actuator assembly has a first slidable component and a second depressible component residing within an aperture defined in the first slidable component. The electric toothbrush is momentarily activated by pressing the cover and causing the projection extending from the inner face to contact and depress the depressible component of the actuator assembly.

In a further aspect, the present invention provides a method for momentarily activating an electric toothbrush disposed within a package. The electric toothbrush has an actuator for preventing accidental or unintended activation. The actuator includes a first slidable component disposed on a housing of the toothbrush. This slidable component defines an aperture within which is disposed a depressible component configured such that upon depressing the depressible component within the aperture, the electric toothbrush is activated. This method includes a step of providing a projection extending from an inwardly directed face of the package. The projection is positioned alongside the depressible component and sized to fit within the aperture defined in the slidable component. The method also includes a step of pressing the package in the proximity of the actuator such that the projection contacts the depressible component and thereby activates the electric toothbrush.

These related applications and patents are all assigned to the same Assignee as the present invention.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a diagnostic test device such as a pregnancy test device or a device such as for detection of a disease state, from a liquid biological sample. It may, for example, find application as a point of care (POC) diagnostic tool or other test device or for over-the-counter (OTC) sale. In such contexts, it is preferably a disposable device.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

It is now commonplace to provide a disposable diagnostic device for the analysis of a single analyte or multiple analytes that originate from a liquid biological sample. Examples of such devices include pregnancy tests and glucose meters for diabetics. In the case of a typical pregnancy test, urine is applied to a wick or collection zone, upon which the sample interacts and mixes with an antibody, or antibodies that specifically recognise the analyte of interest. One of the aforementioned antibodies is always coupled to a colourmetric indicator (often a gold sol or latex particle) for the visual interpretation of a result and often considered as the primary antibody.

The sample and the released components pass through the associated materials (often nitrocellulose) in a lateral flow manner. Deposited on to the nitrocellulose are two zones (or lines) of capture molecules. The first zone (or line) is often the second antibody of a pair that detects the presence of the analyte of interest, however in some embodiments this line is composed of avidin or streptavidin that binds to a biotin coupled to antibody. The second line is often deemed as a control line, and comprises an antibody that specifically recognises the primary antibody or a component bound to the surface of the colourmetric indicator.

The intensity of the first line of the two mentioned above is proportional to the quantity of analyte of interest present in the biological sample. This is deemed as the test line. The second line is used to confirm whether the test has operated correctly, by releasing the reagents, and fluid migrating appropriately. Together the lines represent the manner through which data can be extracted from the immobilised immunoassay that takes place within the device.

In purely visual (i.e. human eye dependent) test devices, a non-skilled user can be confused when a positive result is weak, it could be missed by the user, and considered as a negative, or provide the user with an ambiguous result leading to uncertainty. This may lead to inappropriate conclusions.

It would therefore be desirable to provide an automated, preferably electronic, detector system whereby the risk of inaccuracy can be reduced in terms of determining more reliably, whether there is sufficient contrast (colour change) between a test or control line zone and background and also, to ensure that the line intensities are read/interpreted at the appropriate time post sample application.

Furthermore, our unpublished co-pending application GB0603665.1 discloses the detection of active protease enzyme using a modified lateral flow immunoassay.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,461 discloses a portable analysis device comprising a housing and an optical system consisting of a light source and a photodetector. One or more test elements are mounted on a support strip and are used to perform an assay on a sample. The support is then placed in the housing and is caused to move relative to the housing and the optical system so that the photodetector produces a change in output signal indicative of the reaction of at least one of the test elements in response to the presence of a predetermined analyte in the sample.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus, the present invention provides a diagnostic test device comprising means for sampling a liquid biological sample, means for reacting the sample with at least one reagent to provide one or more visible indicia and an optical detector for detecting the presence of said one or more indicia, the device further comprising a releasable tether which is released by contact with the liquid sample, thereby to cause the optical detector to detect the said one or more indicia.

The releasable tether is preferably formed of a material which disintegrates when wet, eg a water-soluble or water-friable material.

Preferably, the complete device, including electronic circuitry, is formed integrally in a unitary device. Alternatively, it may be embodied as a device which does not include the circuitry for processing the photodetector output and that circuitry may then be housed in a separate unit into which the device is plugged to obtain a readout.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to a device for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid using a lateral flow test cell that exhibits improved detection.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid. Preferably, the gold colloid has a mean particle size of about 60 nm to about 80 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention preferably comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate. In specific embodiments, the biphasic substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material.

In a preferred embodiment, the release medium comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a label and a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte.

Accordingly, in diagnostic tests wherein a liquid sample for testing includes the analyte to be detected, the analyte produces a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

The capture medium preferentially comprises a capture site that includes a capture component for capturing the complex described above. In a specific embodiment, the capture site has immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

The invention is particularly characterized in that multiple aspects of the invention can be combined to provide a diagnostic device including multiple elements useful for providing improved test results, particularly improved accuracy, improved ability to detect low levels of test analyte, and overall improved test results. Preferentially, the invention combines an enhanced label component with an enhanced capture component to improve the overall efficiency of the inventive diagnostic device, particularly in relation to the sensitivity of the diagnostic device.

In one embodiment, the invention comprises a device for detecting an analyte, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate, which comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material.

One or more test elements are mounted on a support strip and are used to perform an assay on a sample. The support is then placed in the housing and is caused to move relative to the housing and the optical system so that the photodetector produces a change in output signal indiciative of the reaction of at least one of the test elements in response to the presence of a predetermined analyte in the sample.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus, the present invention provides a diagnostic test device comprising means for sampling a liquid biological sample, means for reacting the sample with at least one reagent to provide one or more visible indicia in a detection zone and an optical detector for detecting the presence of said one or more indicia, the device further comprising means for causing at least part of the optical detector to move over the detection region.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

This invention relates to laundry detergent compositions having a high water soluble alkaline carbonate (soda ash) builder content.

Laundry detergent compositions comprising a water-soluble alkaline carbonate are well-known in the art. For example, it is conventional to use such a carbonate as a builder in detergent compositions which supplement and enhance the cleaning effect of an active surfactant present in the composition. Such builders improve the cleaning power of the detergent composition, for instance, by the sequestration or precipitation of hardness causing metal ions such as calcium, peptization of soil agglomerates, reduction of the critical micelle concentration, and neutralization of acid soil, as well as by enhancing various properties of the active detergent, such as its stabilization of solid soil suspensions, solubilization of water-insoluble materials, emulsification of soil particles, and foaming and sudsing characteristics. Other mechanisms by which builders improve the cleaning power of detergent compositions are probably present but are less well understood. Builders are important not only for their effect in improving the cleaning ability of active surfactants in detergent compositions, but also because they allow for a reduction in the amount of the surfactant used in the composition, the surfactant being generally much more costly than the builder.

Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and/or potassium carbonate (K2CO3) are the most common carbonates included in laundry detergents to impart increased alkalinity to wash loads, thereby improving detergency against many types of soils. In particular, soils having acidic components e.g. sebum and other fatty acid soils, respond especially well to increased alkalinity.

While laundry detergents containing a relatively large amount of carbonate builder are generally quite satisfactory in their cleaning ability, the use of such carbonate builders often results in the problem of calcium carbonate precipitation, which may give rise to fabric encrustation due to the deposition of the calcium carbonate on the fiber surfaces of fabrics which in turn causes fabric to have a stiff hand and gives colored fabrics a faded appearance. Thus, any change in available carbonate built laundry detergent compositions which reduces their tendency to cause fabric encrustation is highly desirable.

In many applications, it is desirable to include Na2CO3and K2CO3in detergent formulations at levels greater than 20%. This is readily achieved in the case of a powdered detergent. However, incorporating such large amounts into an aqueous liquid is much more difficult. In liquid laundry detergent compositions, the incorporation of a large amount of detergent builder poses a significant formulation challenge since the presence of a major quantity of detergent builder inevitably causes the detergent composition to phase separate. Liquid detergent formulations that contain a detergent builder ingredient require careful control of the surfactant to builder ratio so as to prevent salting-out of the surfactant phase. Liquid laundry detergent compositions are also susceptible to instability under extended freeze/thaw and high/low temperature conditions.

Additionally, sodium carbonate forms an extensive array of low water soluble hydrates at low temperatures and high, i.e., >15 wt. % levels of the sodium carbonate builder. For example, a system with 20% carbonate builder will form a decahydrate phase below 23° C. At 30% sodium carbonate, the decahydrate will form below 31° C. Therefore, even at room temperature, systems containing greater than 20% carbonate builder are inherently unstable and readily form decahydrate phases. Once the decahydrate forms, redissolution can take an inordinate amount of time.

Accordingly, there is still a desire and a need to provide a stable liquid laundry detergent which has a high ash content.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, a stable aqueous-based liquid laundry detergent is provided with an ash content of greater than 15 wt. % by incorporating a hygroscopic agent therein in sufficient amounts to prevent excessive insoluble hydrate formation. One or more surfactants including anionic, non-ionic and amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants can be added. Stability of the liquid composition is further provided by adjusting the ratio of anionic surfactant to zwitterionic surfactant contained in the composition.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a packaging device for condoms. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a condom card device which packages two condoms in separable wells.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are various contraceptives available today, but condoms are the most highly recommended prophylactic. The Surgeon General, various public health organizations, colleges and high schools recommend the use of condoms and even advocate free distribution to some degree as a remedy to the current spread of AIDS and venereal disease. However, there is some embarrassment associated with carrying condoms, especially if they fall out of one's wallet, pocket or purse at an inopportune time (as depicted on at least one episode of virtually every television sit-com in the last five years, or in the movie “Broadcast News” when purses had to be inspected by the Secret Service to gain entrance to an embassy party). There has been a long-felt need for a small, sealable pouch in which one or more foil-sealed condoms could be carried or stored to not only protect them against abrasion, but alleviate the anxiety that a condom might be evidenced under most embarrassing circumstances, thereby removing the reason that they are not handy when needed. Such pouch with one condom should be small enough to place in a wallet without adding much bulk, but flexible enough to contain multiple condoms for carrying or storing elsewhere. It should have a releasable, secure, flexible closure. While the primary utility of the pouch is to facilitate carrying condoms on the person, there has also been a long-felt need for such a product in which to store condoms in an automobile or a suitcase or discreetly within reach from one's bed.

Although substantially impermeable to air and moisture, the materials used to package individual condoms are generally thin and lightweight, and the packages must be adapted to be opened by the application of light-to-moderate manual force. Because of this fact, such packages are also susceptible to tearing or puncturing when placed in contact with other articles, such as might occur, for example, when individually packaged condoms are carried or maintained in a pocket, wallet, purse, glove compartment, desk drawer, or the like. Such tearing or puncturing may not be readily apparent to the user, but may be sufficient to permit contamination or degradation of the condom prior to use, or even failure of the condom during use at a subsequent time. One may also lose confidence in the reliability of a condom that has been carried for some time due to the worn or tattered appearance of the package in which it is wrapped, resulting in further anxiety and/or greater potential risk in the event of sexual contact.

The foregoing problems have deterred the effective utilization of condoms in the past, much to the detriment of the general public health. To obviate these problems, means are needed that can hold a single individually packaged condom, or a relatively small number of individually packaged condoms, that will protect the individually packaged condoms prior to use, and that will conceal individually packaged condoms to alleviate embarrassment to an individual carrying the condoms, or to a bystander.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a means for storing condoms that will protect and conceal the packaged condoms while they are carried on the person or stored by the consumer subsequent to purchase but prior to use. According to the present invention, the storage means, or condom card, comprises two separable half portions each containing a receptacle well for storing at least one condom therein. The at least one condom can be individually packaged in a foil, plastic or other similar wrap. The two separable halves are attached together by juxtaposed tabs and slots to form one single condom card.

The condom card also comprises a means of attaching or snapping the two separable half portions together. Any known means for attaching the two separable halves can be used, for example, juxtaposed tabs and slots can be used. In one embodiment, the condom card is covered with a seal or wrapper cover, e.g., a foil-seal or plastic covering, which is releasably secured over each of the receptacle well openings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention generally relates to ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-bypass protected biologically active content. More specifically in preferred embodiments this invention relates to feedstocks for domesticated ruminants which are capable of delivering undegraded essential aminoacids such as lysine and methionine to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants such as dairy cattle.

Publications cited in the present specification are incorporated by reference.

When a feedstock for ruminants has a content of biologically active constituent, a substantial amount of the said constituent (e.g., protein, aminoacids, and the like) is degraded to ammonia or carbon dioxide gas by microorganisms in the rumen. This prevents effective utilization of the administered biologically active constituent in the feedstock.

When special nutrients or medicaments are administered to ruminants, it is essential to protect these ingredients from decomposition in the rumen. The objective is to pass the said ingredients through the rumen to the omasum, and subsequently to the abomasum and absorption by the small intestine.

There are ongoing research and development activities which are seeking to achieve ruminant feedstock supplements which have the desired rumen-bypass properties. Rumen-bypass formulations are reported in numerous publications such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,842,863; 4,948,589; 5,023,091; 5,064,665; 5,093,128; 5,571,527; 5,633,004; 5,635,198; 6,203,829 and 6,306,427. There is further disclosure in WO2004/080197-A2 (PCT) and references cited therein.

Special effort has been directed to achieving rumen-bypass protection for essential aminoacids which supplement feedstocks for milk-producing ruminants.

It is known that lysine and methionine are important for milk production in dairy cattle. Journal of Dairy Science, 70, 789 (1987) reports that rumen-protected lysine increased feed intake, milk yield and 4% fat-corrected milk production in dairy cows. Rumen-protected methionine and lysine increased production of milk protein in dairy cows.

Similar results are reported in Journal of Dairy Science, 72, 1484 (1989); 72, 1800 (1989); 73, 135 (1990); and 74, 2997 (1991). Data also indicated that added fat increased the percentage and yield of long-chain fatty acids in cow milk. Adding ruminally-protected aminoacids to fat-supplemented diets appeared to alleviate the milk protein depression observed with added lipids in feedstock.

Because of the significant economic consequences of rumen-bypass undegraded dietary nutrient transport, there is continuing interest in the development of superior rumen-bypass feedstock supplements to promote these prospective advantages.

Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-protected biologically active content for advancing ruminant husbandry and for providing value added meat and dairy products for human consumption.

It is another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements to stabilize and maintain the health of ruminants, and to improve the lactational performances of dairy ruminants.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements which deliver post-rumen undegraded aminoacids in milk-producing dairy cattle for increased milk yield and increased production of milk protein.

It is a further object of this invention to provide an efficient process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement in compacted particulate form, which supplement has the capability of passing between about 40-96 percent of its rumen-protected biologically active content to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and example data.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a process for the production of ethanol by fermentation. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a process to improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The production of alcoholic beverages by the fermentation of fruit and grains is of ancient origin. In more recent times, the isolation of ethanol in concentrated or in pure form for use either in beverages, in industry, or as fuel, has assumed considerable importance. In general, ethanol may be produced by the fermentation of simple sugars such as glucose and fructose and oligosaccharides such as sucrose. Such substances and mixtures thereof which, without prior chemical modification, are convertible to ethanol will be referred to herein as “fermentable carbohydrates.” More complex carbohydrates such as starches and cellulosic materials also may be converted to ethanol by fermentation, but usually only after they are degraded to lower molecular weight sugars or related materials. The fermentation proceeds in an anaerobic environment, with production of carbon dioxide by-product. The Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., presents a condensed summary of the state of the art of producing and isolating fermentation-ethanol in Volume 9, at pages 352-361, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Ethanol has widespread application as an industrial chemical, gasoline additive or straight liquid fuel. As a fuel or fuel additive, ethanol dramatically reduces air emissions while improving engine performance. As a renewable fuel, ethanol reduces national dependence on finite and largely foreign fossil fuel sources while decreasing the net accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

In contrast to energy production by combustion of fossil fuels, energy production by combustion of contemporary biomass (predominantly in the form of harvested plant material) or fuels derived from such biomass is regarded as being “CO2-neutral”, since the amount of CO2released by combustion of a given amount of such biomass corresponds to the amount of CO2which was originally taken up from the atmosphere during the build-up of that amount of biomass.

Among fuels derived from plant biomass, ethanol has received particular attention as a potential replacement for or supplement to petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon products. To minimize the production cost of ethanol produced from biomass (also referred to in the following as “bioethanol”) it is important to use biomass in the form of low-cost by-products from gardening, agriculture, forestry, the timber industry and the like; thus, for example, materials such as straw, maize stems, forestry waste (log slash, bark, small branches, twigs and the like), sawdust and wood-chips are all materials which can be employed to produce bioethanol.

Biomass typically includes materials containing cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein and carbohydrates such as starch and sugar. Common forms of biomass include trees, shrubs and grasses, corn and corn husks as well as municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. Biomass high in starch, sugar or protein such as corn, grains, fruits and vegetables are usually consumed as food. Conversely, biomass high in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are not readily digestible and are primarily utilized for wood and paper products, fuel, or are disposed of.

Biomass contains two basic constituents, carbohydrates and lignin. The carbohydrate content of the biomass contains cellulose and hemicellulose. Both cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugars of glucose and xylose. Fermentation converts glucose and xylose to ethanol using enzymes produced by microorganisms, for example, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,210. Control of nutrients, pH, temperature, sugar concentration, and microorganism concentration all affect rate of fermentation to form ethanol. When ethanol concentration reaches above about 6 to 12%, ethanol concentration can be lethal to the microorganisms employed for fermentation. To reduce ethanol concentration within broth employed for fermentation and maintain activity of microorganisms, extraction of ethanol from the broth by solvents non-toxic to microorganisms, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,110,319, 4,865,973 and No. 4,517,298. The operations disclosed require energy for vaporization of ethanol and subsequent condensation to produce liquid ethanol.

The various operations in processes for obtaining ethanol from such recurring sources as cellulose, cane sugar, amylaceous grains and tubers, e.g., the separation of starch granules from non-carbohydrate plant matter and other extraneous substances, the acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and/or cellulose to fermentable sugar (saccharification), the fermentation of sugar to a dilute solution of ethanol and the recovery of anhydrous ethanol by distillation, have been modified in numerous ways to achieve improvements in product yield, production rates and so forth. For ethanol to realize its vast potential as a partial or total substitute for petroleum fuels or as a substitute chemical feedstock, it is necessary that the manufacturing process be as efficient in the use of energy and raw materials as possible so as to maximize the energy return for the amount of ethanol produced and enhance the standing of the ethanol as an economically viable replacement for petroleum-based chemicals. To date, however, relatively little concern has been given to the energy requirements for manufacturing ethanol from biomass and consequently, little effort has been made to minimize the thermal expenditure for carrying out any of the discrete operations involved in the manufacture of ethanol from vegetative sources.

There are three basic methods known for accelerating the fermentation rates of a sugar media to ethanol. These methods include 1) increasing the cell density, and/or 2) reducing the concentration of inhibitory compound(s) (with ethanol being most inhibitory due to its osmolality and toxic effects) in the media as suggested by Dale in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,027 and 5,141,861. The third method is to control the growth environment; such as with trace elements, vitamins, amino acid, pH, and temperature (Biology of Microorganisms, 7thedition, Brock, Madigan, Martinko and Parler. Prenitice Hall, Ney Jersey 1994). During a normal batch ethanol fermentation with standardS. cerevisaestrains, a final cell concentration of between 1.5 and 15 g/l cells is achieved. It is often noted that cell growth completely stops after a certain cell density is reached (Holzberg et al, 1967). The oxygen tension in the fermentation is important in these batch fermentations, as the cells will convert a larger fraction of the sugar substrate towards cell mass production as the amount of oxygen available to the cells increases. Trace oxygen can serve as a nutrient during the anaerobic fermentation of sugars, allowing more cell production that results in a greater fermentation rate of sugar to ethanol. Cysewski and Wilke (1978) show an optimal oxygen tension of about 0.1 mm O2. To maintain a cell density higher than the natural maximum attained in the fermenter, methods for keeping the cells in the fermenter must be utilized. A high cell density can be maintained either by recycling cells (through membrane or centrifugal techniques) or by retaining or immobilizing the cells within the reactor. Immobilization would seem to be advantageous as the capital expense of a cell recovery and recycle system can be eliminated. There has been a good deal of work over the last 10-15 years on immobilizing organisms to maintain a high cell density in the bioreactor. Immobilization can take one of several approaches, 1) entrapment within a gel bead or plate, 2) adsorption onto a solid matrix, or 3) self-agglomeration or flocculation into flakes or pellets.

Increasing temperature generally speeds a fermentation until the temperature becomes high enough to cause cell death. Fermentation rates are generally noted to increase from 20° to 32° C., doubling with a 5° C. increase in temperature.

The traditional process of fermentation is carried out in a conventional batch operation utilizing yeast as the fermenting organism. To increase the efficiency a variation of the batch operation occasionally includes recycling of the yeast cells by systems such as sedimentation, centrifugation, or ultrafiltration. Normally this batch operation is conducted in two stages. The first stage involves propagation of the yeast and is referred to as the growth stage. The second stage involves the anaerobic process of ethanol production which is accompanied by a depletion of the oxygen. Further propagation of the yeast occurs during the anaerobic process of ethanol production.

Typically, a yeast inoculum is prepared in stage one. The requirements for maximum yeast reproduction are adequate amounts of carbon, nitrogen, minerals and oxygen, a pH in the range of 3.5 to 4.5, and a temperature in the range of 29°-35° C. Aerobic growth conditions define a system for more efficient production of yeast but under which no ethanol is produced. Stage two is the fermentation stage where the alcohol is actually produced by the yeast from the fermentable sugars. The yeast inoculum produced in stage one is used to seed a large fermenter containing glucose at appropriate pH, temperature and sugar concentration. Glucose was formed from the conversion of dextrins via saccharification enzymes. The dextrins were derived from molasses, corn starch materials, etc. via liquification enzymes. The inoculation rate can be 5 to 10 million cells per ml and during the fermentation the viable cell count can increase to 150-200 million cells per ml. Heat produced is controlled through the use of cooling coils. At these yeast levels, a final ethanol concentration of about 9 to 11% (v/v) can be obtained in 30 to 70 hours with batch fermentation. Increasing the yeast content, as is the case with cell recycle, can considerably reduce the time required for completion of the fermentation. For example, with a cell density of 800 to 1000 million cells per ml, it is possible to reduce the fermentation time to 4 to 10 hours.

Processes for the continuous fermentation of sugars to provide alcohol are also well known (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,155,134; 2,371,208; 2,967,107; 3,015,612; 3,078,166; 3,093,548; 3,177,005; 3,201,328; 3,207,605; 3,207,606; 3,219,319; 3,234,026; 3,413,124; 3,528,887; 3,575,813; 3,591,454; 3,705,841; 3,737,323; and 3,940,492 “Process Design and Economic Studies of Alternative Fermentation Methods for the Production of Ethanol”, Cysewski, et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. xx, pp. 1421-1444 (1978)). In a typical continuous fermentation process, a stream of sterile sugar liquor and a quantity of yeast cells are introduced into the first of a battery of fermentation vessels wherein initial fermentation takes place, generally under conditions favoring rapid cell growth. The partial fermentate admixed with yeast cells is continuously withdrawn from the first fermentation vessel wherein fermentation is carried out under conditions favoring the rapid conversion of sugar to ethanol. The yeast in the last fermentation vessel can be recovered by suitable means, e.g., centrifugation or settlement, and recycled. In such a system, the ability of the fermentation organism to produce ethanol is affected by the ethanol and sugar concentrations. As a rule, a yeast which gives high conversion rates of sugar to ethanol in a low-ethanol, high-sugar fermentation medium will only sluggishly produce ethanol under the opposite conditions, i.e., at high-ethanol level, low-sugar concentrations.

In general, however, the price of bioethanol has not been competitive with that of traditional fossil fuels and it is therefore highly needed to reduce production costs as far as possible by optimizing or improving upon bioethanol production technologies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an anaerobic fermentation process to enhance or improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time. A process is disclosed using a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions for the enhanced production of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar containing source. The process for producing ethanol by anaerobic fermentation comprises converting a carbohydrate or sugar source to ethanol using an ethanol producing microorganism in a fermentation broth, wherein said fermentation broth contains one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water, whereby said ethanol production is enhanced.

In another embodiment, a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions is used to increase or enhance ethanol production from the fermentation of an ethanol producing microorganism. A fermentation broth for the fermentation of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar source can comprise an ethanol producing microorganism, one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water.

The present invention provides a viable commercial method for ethanol production and can be used in, for example, fuel ethanol, industrial, cheese, brewing, and wine making industries.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The field of the present invention relates generally to condoms, and more specifically to condoms having a lubricant system which imparts warmth, or provides a warming effect or sensation upon use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of lubrication systems for condoms are disclosed in the art. Some of the lubricants employed are sold or supplied separately as so-called personal lubricants, while others are applied to condoms prior to packaging. Some lubricants have particular physiological effects. For example, Heidenfelder (U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,188) discloses the coating of the interior surface of a condom with a local anesthetic such as benzocaine to provide desensitization.

The instant invention is directed to a condom together with a lubricant which provides a warming effect or sensation upon use. This effect is in contrast to the cooling sensation imparted by conventional lubricants.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally provides a condom in combination with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols. Such glycols, provided they are present in an environment relatively free from unbound water, will warm upon contact with compositions containing unbound water. Such warming of glycol based condom lubricants results in a warming sensation during condom use.

In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a condom comprising:

A male genital engaging tubular sheath having an inner surface and an outer surface together with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols in a mixture containing little or no unbound water, such that said lubricating composition warms upon contact with compositions containing free or unbound water.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition for animal dross and its method of use. More particularly, the present invention relates to a litter that agglomerates and displays a color upon being wetted.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

House-broken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added absorbent materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The dross-soiled absorbent must be regularly cleaned to maintain a hygienic environment and to thwart the emission of objectionable odors from the presence of the urine and fecal matter in the litter. Removal of fecal matter from any litter is somewhat easy as they are generally solid objects that can be physically removed from the litter. However, physical removal of the feces does not address the issues of removing liquid dross from the litter nor does it help reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Thus it can be said that the removal of the liquid dross from the litter is harder to execute.

Though the absorbent material aids in absorbing liquid dross, it does nothing to aid in the removal of the liquid dross and to identify the liquid dross in the litter. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. The homeowner then washes the litter box and refills the litter box with fresh litter box absorbent material. These activities are unpleasant, time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome. However, repeated litter box cleanings over a period of time accounts for relatively large expenditures.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost, but each suffers from the disadvantage of merely absorbing a liquid waste product and holding the product within its porous matrices, or, in the case of sand, adsorbing the liquid dross on its surface. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, has to be discarded.

Currently clumping clays and other water absorbent material are used to improve litter compositions. An improved composition for animal litters uses the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral in the montmorillonite clay family. These absorbent materials not only absorb liquid dross, but they aid in the identification of used litter from unused litter portions. These absorbent materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine thus facilitating the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter. The wetted clump has the ability to group into a size substantially larger than the individual particles comprising the litter.

Though these improved compositions have eased the owners' task of removing soiled litter portions, they are still short of addressing problems associated with the burial or splitting of the clumped dross. The buried or split clump, if not timely discovered, will emit offensive odors within a relatively short period of time. Thus when the clumped dross is buried or split the homeowner must still either patiently sift through the litter to remove the used portions or simply discard the partially soiled litter. As a result, the benefits of having a clumped litter are diminished since the removal of the clumped dross once again becomes a time-consuming as well as costly process.

The following prior art references illustrate aspects of the technology of animal litter preparation, and, in particular, disclose the use of clays in such litters.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,420 issued Aug. 11, 1987 to Stuart, discloses an animal litter composition comprising a water-absorbing polymer such as a polyacryate combined with a porous inert solid substrate such as clay.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,115 issued Mar. 19, 1991 to Hughes, discloses the use of a water swellable bentonite clay as an absorbent litter material. The clay absorbs the liquids in animal waste which on contacting the clay agglomerates it into a stable mass easily separated from the unwetted and unsoiled portion of the composition.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,532 issued Dec. 7, 1993 to Franklin, et al., discloses a pH-indicating material maintained on an inert carrier that is separate from the cat litter material. The pH-indicating material has dual indicators that provide one color transition at a low pH and a different color transition at a high pH so that acidic or alkaline animal urine problems can be visibly detected upon contact between the animal urine and the pH-indicating material.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,054 issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Pluta, et al., discloses an animal litter composition used to diagnose animal health problems. The composition comprises at least one uncalcined clay substrate having a calcium oxide content of less than about 5% by weight and wherein the clay mineral component of said substrate has an attapulgite content of at least about 35% by weight, in combination with at least one chemical pH indicator.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,233 issued Sep. 16, 2003 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,763,783 issued Jul. 20, 2004 both to Mochizuki, disclose a granulated-type, urine-discharge processing material for animals that discriminates between before-use and after-use. The material comprises a water absorbent granular body dyed with water soluble dyes or a water absorbent granular body containing powder of water soluble dyes, and a water absorbent surface layer covering a surface of the water absorbent granular body. The water absorbent surface layer and the water absorbent granular body are bonded to each other through a non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer formed of a plurality of adhesive non-coated parts and a plurality of adhesive coated parts which is coated on the surface of the water absorbent granular body. Discharged animal urine is permeated into the water absorbent granular body through the water absorbent surface layer and the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer, or by dissolving the adhesive coated parts. Thereby, the water soluble dyes are eluted into the discharged urine so that the water absorbent surface layer is dyed through the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer. The water absorbent granular body is chiefly composed of vegetable fiber or vegetable powder and contains inorganic fillers. The water absorbent granular body further contains powder of a water absorbent polymer so that the granular body can have rich water absorbing and retaining properties. No mention is made to clays in the patent.

A need exists for a clumping litter that clumps in response to wetness and can be readily discovered and removed from the remaining dry litter when clumped and wet.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A clump recognition animal litter is disclosed that enables a user to visually identify and dispose of all used litter portions from unused litter portions regardless of clump size and clump location. The clump recognition animal litter comprises a clumping component and a color indicating material. A wetted litter clumps and displays a color in response to wetness.

"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT: N/A

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a method of using a composition and compound with antiprotozoal activity. These methods and materials will potentiate control of protozoal populations under a variety of conditions, particularly in ruminants.

The normal diet of the ruminant animal is forage. Forage includes grasses, legumes and cellulytic byproducts of agricultural production. These are either fed fresh as pasture or green chop; in a dry form as hay; or in a preserved state as silage. The ability to utilize these materials as sources of nutrients is only possible as a result of pregastric bacterial fermentation in the rumen, the nonfundic portion of the animal's stomach. Here, bacterial action reduces the complex structural carbohydrates; cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and the associated nonstructural carbohydrates; pectin, starches and sugars, to either fatty acids or more chemically simplistic carbohydrate forms, which are then subjected to gastric action in the fundic stomach and small intestine.

The adaptation of ruminants to pregastric digestion has involved a system of retention of digesta, which is an essential part of the mechanism for maximal extraction of energy. This retention requires some sacrifices in food intake, which becomes more limited on forage based diets because the coarser ingests must be retained longer to achieve efficient extraction of energy. This poses a special problem in the modern, domesticated ruminant, in that the nutrient demands created by genetic selection for rapid lean muscle growth or high levels of milk production far exceed the supply generated by rumenal fermentation of forage based diets.

The diets that must be fed require the addition of large amounts of nonstructural carbohydrate (starches and sugars) fed in the form of grain which, unfortunately, often is a source of physiologic and metabolic stress.

These problems are associated with the changes which occur in rumenal fermentation as a result of grain ingestion. As a consequence, feeding strategies must attempt to maximize forage use while not compromising nutrient supply needed for maintenance and production.

A solution to the problem of nutrient supply and demand in the ruminant animal, as imposed by the limitations of bacterial, pregastric digestion, is to enhance the efficiency and rate at which this process occurs. The rumen is a continuous fermentation system that is provided with nutrients (feeds), buffers (salivary and other salts) and fluids (water and saliva) on both a continuous and an intermittent basis. The efficiency of this fermentation is measured through rumen turnover. Turnover is conventionally expressed as the portion of the rumen contents that leaves the rumen per hour. Liquids and solids turn over at different, but usually related, rates. Liquid flow rates, as proportions of the total liquid volume, have been found to turn over at rates that increased from <8 to 13.5%/hr as dry matter intake went from 5 to 21 kg/day (Livestock Prod. Sci.,17:37, 1987). At the same time, solids turnover increased from 3 to 5%/hr due to increased intake. In other studies, values of 17%/hr for liquids (Can. J. Ani. Sci.,64 (Supp.):80, 1984) and as high as 7.0%/hr for concentrates (J. Dairy Sci., 65:1445, 1982) were reported. In a typical ration of a dairy cow consuming >20 kg dry matter/day, representative rumen digesta passage rates would be 15%/hr for liquids, 6%/hr for grains and 4.5%/hr for forages. The rates would all decrease with a lower level of intake.

Another important rumen characteristic associated with turnover rate is microbial yield, where microbial yield is defined as the quantity of microbial mass flowing from the rumen per day. A further, and important refinement of this expression of microbial yield, which is also effected by turnover rate, is the efficiency of microbial yield. This is usually expressed as grams of microbial protein (or nitrogen) produced per kg of organic matter (OM) digested in the rumen. Both aspects of microbial production have applied significance. Microbial yield is important as an index of the amount of microbial protein available to the ruminant animal per day.

Microbial efficiency is important as part of the calculation of microbial yield where: microbial yield (gr of microbial N/day)=microbial efficiency (gr microbial N/kg digested organic matter)×kg OM digested in the rumen per day.

Because of the rapid rumen turnover rates commonly found in cattle with high dry matter intakes, such as dairy cattle, high microbial efficiencies are expected. If, however, an imbalance in the nutrients available to the rumen microbes occurs, the microbial efficiency can be impaired. This is particularly evident if ruminally available nitrogen or carbohydrate sources are inadequate.

Another factor which effects ruminal microbial efficiency and yield is predation by rumen protozoa. The rate of bacterial predation is proportional to the concentration of bacteria available. Coleman (The Roles of Protozoa and Fungi in Ruminant Digestion. Armidale, Penambul Books, 1989, p. 13) reported that when bacterial concentrations were 109/ml, a value representative of that in rumen fluid, the average uptake for 18 protozoal species was 493 bacteria/hr/protozoa; when bacteria were at the maximum density, the average uptake for the 18 species of protozoa was 3,739 bacteria/hr/protozoa. Protozoal predation involves engulfment which usually kills the bacteria. The overall effect of predation on bacterial numbers is considerable.

It has been shown that the removal of protozoa (defaunation) can result in a 2-4 fold increase in numbers of rumen bacteria. The reduction in bacterial numbers is not uniform across all species. Generally, more amylolytic than cellulolytic bacteria are engulfed. It is possible, therefore to conclude that the extent and rate of digestion of various carbohydrates differs between fuanated and defuanated animals. Protozoa also have negative effects on rumen function. Because of their sequestration on large feed particles and on the rumen wall, the flow of protozoa from the rumen is less than would be predicted from their concentration in the rumen and rate of digesta flow.

Therefore, although protozoa can represent 50% of the biomass in the rumen, they contribute 20% or less to the microbial protein flowing to the duodenum. In addition, predation on bacteria causes recycling of bacterial protein in the rumen. Protozoa engulf and kill large quantities of bacteria, assimilating much of the protein from these organisms.

Since most of the protozoa remain in the rumen until they lyse, microbial protein flow from the rumen also is reduced. In vivo measurements summarized by Jounay et al (Anim. Feed Sci. Tech. 21:229, 1988) indicate that defuanation resulted in a 36% increase in grs of microbial nitrogen flowing from the rumen per kg of organic matter fermented.

An additional negative aspect of protozoa on digestive function that is important to ruminants in general, and high producing dairy cows in particular, is their engulfment and digestion of particulate feed protein. This permits protozoa to assimilate proteins of low rumen degradability which have been added to the diet as sources of by-pass protein (Hoover et al. Rumen Digestive Physiology and Microbial Ecology, West Virginia University Bulletin 708T; p 22.).

The overall effects of the presence or absence of protozoa in ruminants are not well characterized because of the difficulty in reducing their numbers in viva. Compounds which have demonstrated defuanating activity have proven too toxic to safely feed to ruminants or ineffective when fed for prolonged periods of time. Thus although the benefits of defuanation have been conclusively demonstrated in vitro, the transferal of this information to field practice has yet to be accomplished.

OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In view of deficiencies in the art as described above and other related goals well known in the art, one object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive method of use which, when used as a component in ruminant diets, will control, reduce and prevent protozoal populations in the ruminant by promoting facultative bacterial growth.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive and method of use which allows for the control, reduction and prevention of protozoal populations and thereby allow for the maximization of ruminal microbial growth and efficiency, the benefits of which increased flow of microbial protein to the duodenum, increased ruminal fermentation efficiency, and increased dry matter intake.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a feed additive that does not have any negative effects upon the bacterial population of the rumen.

An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a method for controlling, reducing or preventing the growth of protozoa in the rumen of a ruminant, comprising feeding an antiprotozoal amount of a composition comprising cell bodies of a facultative anaerobeCorynebacterium, orBrevibacteriumhaving antiprotozoal activity, glutamic acid fermentation solubles, or corn fermentation solubles to a ruminant, and thereby promoting facultative anaerobe growth to increase the amount of said cell bodies and the fermentation solubles including such cell bodies.

The composition and compound, when used as a feed supplement in a diet formulated for ruminant animals, will significantly reduce ruminal protozoal populations, although the use of the invention to control protozoal populations is not restricted to ruminal control alone.

The method of the present invention of ruminal protozoal control has been shown to significantly enhance feed intake and increase ruminal digestive efficiency. Simply stated, the compound of the present invention includes a combination of bacterial cell bodies, nonprotein nitrogen and amino acids dried on a carrier. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the source of the antiprotozoal compound is derived from the cell bodies of facultative bacterial species, preferably˜Corynebacterium. Another source isBrevibacterium. Preferred species arelactofermentumandglutamicum. Antiprotozoal activity is found in the isolated cell bodies themselves or in the byproduct materials derived from the fermentations driven by these bacteria in which the cell bodies may be present (fermentation solubles). Examples are glutamic acid fermentation solubles and corn fermentation solubles. In ruminant animals, the cell bodies and/or the fermentation byproducts may be fed unprocessed (undried), although maximum response is achieved when the cell bodies and/or the byproducts are dried at temperatures that do not denature the organic nitrogen components present therein. This temperature varies with the drying method used and generally ranges from not less than about 80 to not more than about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention generally relates to a control release formulation that is supplemented with a rumen-bypass protected biologically active content. More specifically, in preferred embodiments this invention relates to ruminant feedstocks for domesticated ruminants which are capable of delivering undegraded essential aminoacids such as lysine and methionine to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants such as dairy cattle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Publications cited in the present specification are incorporated by reference.

When a feedstock for ruminants has a content of biologically active constituent, a substantial amount of the said constituent (e.g., protein, aminoacids, and the like) is degraded to ammonia or carbon dioxide gas by microorganisms in the rumen. This prevents effective utilization of the administered biologically active constituent in the feedstock.

When special nutrients or medicaments are administered to ruminants, it is essential to protect these ingredients from decomposition in the rumen. The objective is to pass the said ingredients through the rumen to the omasum, and subsequently to the abomasum and absorption by the small intestine.

There are ongoing research and development activities which are seeking to achieve ruminant feedstock supplements which have the desired rumen-bypass properties. Rumen-bypass formulations are reported in numerous publications such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,842,863; 4,948,589; 5,023,091; 5,064,665; 5,093,128; 5,571,527; 5,633,004; 5,635,198; 6,203,829 and 6,306,427. There is further disclosure in WO2004/080197-A2 (PCT) and references cited therein.

Special effort has been directed to achieving rumen-bypass protection for essential aminoacids which supplement feedstocks for milk-producing ruminants.

It is known that lysine and methionine are important for milk production in dairy cattle. Journal of Dairy Science, 70, 789 (1987) reports that rumen-protected lysine increased feed intake, milk yield and 4% fat-corrected milk production in dairy cows; rumen-protected methionine and lysine increased production of milk protein in dairy cows.

Similar results are reported in Journal of Dairy Science, 72, 1484 (1989); 72, 1800 (1989); 73, 135 (1990); and 74, 2997 (1991). Data also indicated that added fat increased the percentage and yield of long-chain fatty acids in cow milk. Adding ruminally-protected aminoacids to fat-supplemented diets appeared to alleviate the milk protein depression observed with added lipids in feedstock.

Because of the significant economic consequences of rumen-bypass undegraded dietary nutrient transport, there is continuing interest in the development of superior rumen-bypass feedstock supplements to promote these prospective advantages.

Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-protected biologically active content for advancing ruminant husbandry and for providing value added meat and dairy products for human consumption.

It is another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements to stabilize and maintain the health of ruminants, and to improve the lactational performances of dairy ruminants.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements which deliver post-rumen undegraded aminoacids in milk-producing dairy cattle for increased milk yield and increased production of milk protein.

It is a further object of this invention to provide an efficient process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement in compacted particulate form, which supplement has the capability of passing between about 20-99 percent of its rumen-protected biologically active content to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and example data.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention discloses a control release formulation (e.g., a rumen-bypass dietary supplement) in compacted form. In one embodiment, the control release formulation (or supplement) has the capability to transport a fatty acid salt (e.g., a fatty acid calcium salt) and one or more rumen-protected undegraded biologically active agents (e.g., an aminoacid) to the post-ruminal digestive system of a ruminant. In accordance with the present invention, the rumen-bypass dietary supplement comprises: (a) a fatty acid salt; (b) one or more biologically active agents; (c) a free alkali metal salt and/or a free alkaline earth metal salt; and (d) a binder. In one embodiment, under ruminant feeding conditions the dietary supplement has the capability to transport between about 20-99 percent of one or more rumen-protected undegraded biologically active agents (e.g., an aminoacid) to the post-rumen digestive system of a ruminant.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement comprising: (1) blending a fatty acid salt (e.g., an alkaline earth metal salt) and one or more biologically active agents to form solid central core particles; (2) compacting the core particles to form pellets; (3) optionally coating the pellets with a liquid carboxylate salt-forming fatty acid constituent and/or a liquid carboxylate salt; and (4) optionally applying one or more additional coatings to the pellets with a constituent comprising a basic inorganic alkaline earth metal compound to create an in situ reactive carboxylate salt-forming matrix.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to a device for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid using a lateral flow test cell that exhibits improved detection.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid. Preferably, the gold colloid has a mean particle size of about 60 nm to about 80 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention preferably comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate. In specific embodiments, the biphasic substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material.

In a preferred embodiment, the release medium comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a label and a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte. The release medium further comprises a capturable conjugate comprising a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte and a capturable component, such as biotin. Accordingly, in diagnostic tests wherein a liquid sample for testing includes the analyte to be detected, the analyte produces a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

The capture medium preferentially comprises a capture site that includes a capture component for capturing the complex described above. In a specific embodiment, the capture site has immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

The invention is particularly characterized in that multiple aspects of the invention can be combined to provide a diagnostic device including multiple elements useful for providing improved test results, particularly improved accuracy, improved ability to detect low levels of test analyte, and overall improved test results. Preferentially, the invention combines an enhanced label component with an enhanced capture component to improve the overall efficiency of the inventive diagnostic device, particularly in relation to the sensitivity of the diagnostic device.

In one embodiment, the invention comprises a device for detecting an analyte, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate, which comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material. The release medium preferably comprises both a labeled conjugate and a capturable conjugate. The labeled conjugate comprises a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid having a mean particle size of about 50 nm to about 100 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The capturable conjugate comprises a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, the analyte produces a complex comprising the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate. The capture medium preferably comprises a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

In another aspect, the present invention provides various methods for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample. In one embodiment, the method comprises providing a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device. Preferably the device comprises a biphasic substrate comprising a release medium and a capture medium. The release medium is generally formed of a first material and comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising colloidal gold particles having a mean particle size of at least about 50 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The release medium further comprises a capturable conjugate comprising a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a complex is formed comprising the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate. The capture medium is in fluid communication with the release medium and is typically formed of a second, different material, the capture medium comprising a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin. In preferred embodiments, the method further comprises adding a liquid sample to the first portion of the device and allowing the liquid sample to flow across the release medium and the capture medium. According to the method, the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample is determined by visual inspection of the capture medium, wherein the presence of the analyte is indicated by the presence of color development at the capture site caused by the binding of the streptavidin capture component with the complex formed of the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

In another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises providing an analyte detection device comprising a substrate with a first portion comprising colloidal gold having a mean particle size of 50 nm to 100 nm releasably immobilized thereon and a second portion in fluid communication with the first portion and comprising a capture component immobilized thereon. The method further comprises adding a liquid sample to the first portion of the device, allowing the liquid sample to flow across the first portion and the second portion of the substrate, and determining the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample by visual inspection of the second portion of the substrate. Preferably, the presence of the analyte is indicated by the presence of color development in the area wherein the capture component is immobilized caused by accumulation of the colloidal gold.

In further embodiments, the method of the invention is specifically directed to the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to a device for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid using a lateral flow test cell that exhibits improved detection.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid. Preferably, the gold colloid has a mean particle size of about 60 nm to about 80 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention preferably comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate. In specific embodiments, the biphasic substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and foamed of a second, different material.

In a preferred embodiment, the release medium comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a label and a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte. The release medium further comprises a capturable conjugate comprising a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte and a capturable component, such as biotin. Accordingly, in diagnostic tests wherein a liquid sample for testing includes the analyte to be detected, the analyte produces a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

The capture medium preferentially comprises a capture site that includes a capture component for capturing the complex described above. In a specific embodiment, the capture site has immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

The invention is particularly characterized in that multiple aspects of the invention can be combined to provide a diagnostic device including multiple elements useful for providing improved test results, particularly improved accuracy, improved ability to detect low levels of test analyte, and overall improved test results. Preferentially, the invention combines an enhanced label component with an enhanced capture component to improve the overall efficiency of the inventive diagnostic device, particularly in relation to the sensitivity of the diagnostic device.

In one embodiment, the invention comprises a device for detecting an analyte, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate, which comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As is well-known, many species of animals and birds are raised and/or kept by people for various purposes, e.g., as pets; for the production of valuable products such as food or furs; or for experimental purposes. A major problem connected with the raising and/or keeping of animals is the disposition of their waste excretions, mainly urine and feces. Whether the animal or bird is caged, in which case its waste is deposited on the floor of the cage, or allowed to roam free but is trained to deposit its waste in a particular receptacle, a “litter” material is generally employed which is capable of absorbing the liquid portion of waste excretions, primarily urine and the excess liquid of fecal matter.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost, but each suffers from the disadvantage of merely absorbing a liquid waste product and holding the product within its porous matrices, or, in the case of sand, absorbing the liquid dross on its surface. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, has to be discarded.

In order to reduce or eliminate objectionable odors, homeowners periodically remove the fecal matter from the litter absorbent physically. However, physical removal of the feces does not reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. The homeowner then washes the litter box and refills the litter box with fresh litter box absorbent material. These activities are unpleasant, time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome. However, repeated litter box cleanings over a period of time accounts for relatively large expenditures.

Of particular interest as the basic component of animal litters are the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral, e.g., montmorillonite, since these materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine. This facilitates the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter.

Many clumping animal litters are made from clays and other mineral substrates. Such litters typically include particles of a mineral substrate, which substrate functions as an absorbent and/or odor reducer. The particles may be coated with a liquid-activated adhesive material, such as gelatinized starch, on the surfaces of the particles. When wetted, the adhesive material is activated and causes the discrete litter particles to agglomerate into clumps.

Although clay-based litters may be functional as clumping animal litters, such litters suffer from certain drawbacks. For example, one disadvantage of clay litters is the high density of the clay component of the litter. Because of this high density, a heavy mass of litter must be used for a given volume of urine. The resulting clumps of spent litter are somewhat heavy, and thus can fracture in the absence of strong interparticle adhesion. Another disadvantage of clay litters is that, because the clay is not biodegradable, the litter cannot be flushed into some sewerage systems after use. This may be inconvenient for certain animal owners.

Clumping litters made from bentonite were introduced in 1989, providing better and longer lasting odor control than did traditional litters. Bentonite is a swelling mineral of the clay category, with a unique ability to gel and agglomerate when wetted, creating scoopable clumps. However, mineral based clumping litter are heavy and dusty. While their innate absorption, clumping, and odor control attributes are good, further performance improvement by solid and/or liquid additives is limited.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A light density clay granule useful for a litter material is provided by treating the clay with an electrolyte solution and then heating at elevated temperatures sufficient to increase the porosity of the clay granule. Substantial reduction in the bulk density of the clay granules has been achieved.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is related to devices that can selectively detect hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-H) for detecting pregnancy in a woman. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of evaluating the viability of a pregnancy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta soon after fertilization. This hormone has the crucial role of maintaining steroid production by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, and ensures that pregnancy progresses unabated. Thus, the detection of hCG has been utilized as a marker for pregnancy in women. Accordingly, measurement of hCG in blood or urine has been the basis of prior and current pregnancy tests or devices.

hCG

More specifically, the hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit is unique. However, there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity (Pierce and Parsons, 1981; Stenman et al., 2006).

hCG has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa. About one-third of this mass is due to glycosylation consisting of 8 oligosaccharide chains covalently bound to the alpha and beta subunits (Pierce and Parsons, 1981). It is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells following fertilization and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy (Hoshina et al., 1985; Lustbader et al., 1998). During excretion, intact hCG can be partially degraded into its component subunits allowing different variants of hCG to be detected in liquid samples, such as urine.

As is well known, the association of hCG and pregnancy was first reported in 1927. During the 1960's, the advent of immunoassays allowed the direct detection of hCG in pregnancy urine (Wide and Gemzell, 1960; Vaitukaitis et al., 1972). A variety of different hCG isoforms or fragments are present in both serum and urine. Intact hCG has been discovered to be the predominant form of hCG and have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy despite the presence of the other isoforms detected include free hCG alpha subunit, free hCG beta subunit, hCG beta core fragment, nicked hCG, and hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) (O'Connor et al., 1994; McChesney et al., 2005).

hCG-H

Although intact hCG is the most prevalent form of the molecule found throughout pregnancy, other distinct isoforms have emerged with different biological activities. One such form, hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H), differs from regular hCG in the amount of and/or location of oligosaccharide chains present on the beta subunit of hCG. This different glycosylation pattern is believed to alter the function of the molecule such that hCG-H provides a role in promoting implantation of a developing zygote.

Whereas hCG production is typically considered to be limited to pregnancy, it has also been found to be produced in certain types of invasive cancer associated with gestational trophoblastic disease (Cole et al., 2006). These tumors (hytatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumors) are both aggressive and malignant, and a key marker for their presence is the production of hCG (particularly the beta subunit of hCG) in the absence of pregnancy (Cole et al., 2003). Research into hCG produced by choriocarcinoma tumor cells identified that there were significant weight differences in hCG derived from choriocarcinoma when compared to hCG present in pregnancy (˜40 kDa compared to ˜37 kDa) (Hussa, 1977; Mizuochi et al., 1983; Amano et al., 1988). Further studies on the choriocarcinoma derived hCG elucidated that the weight differences were due to excess glycosylation leading to significantly larger oligosaccharides on the beta subunit (Elliott et al., 1997). The term hyperglycosylated hCG, or hCG-H, was coined for this higher molecular weight choriocarcinoma derived hCG containing invasive properties, with regular hCG reserved for the hCG with normal oligosaccharide chains found during pregnancy (Elliott et al., 1997; Cole et al., 1998).

Previously researchers developed an hCG-H monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with hCG-H produced by a single patient with choriocarcinoma. This antibody, B152, specifically recognized choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H in both serum and urine. This allowed researchers to more effectively screen and monitor the presence of hCG-H. Subsequent studies utilizing the B152 antibody found that hCG-H is not only produced by choriocarcinoma, but it is also found in very early pregnancy as well (O'Connor et al., 1998), and that hCG-H is the predominant form of hCG produced by cytotrophoblast cells at the time of trophoblast invasion irrespective if the invasion is associated with choriocarcinoma or pregnancy (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Cytotrophoblast cells differ from those that produce regular hCG (syncytiotrophoblast cells), and they confer a different function to hCG-H that is closely linked with the implantation of the zygote into the uterine lining after conception (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Studies have also shown that hCG-H cannot replace the corpus luteum stimulating activity of regular hCG which suggests a distinct biological activity for hCG-H separate from that of pregnancy promoting function of regular hCG (Cole et al., 1991).

Early pregnancy derived hCG-H has the same molecular weight as choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H (Kovalesyskaya et al., 2002), and the majority of all hCG immunoreactivity in serum and urine samples from early pregnancy is due to the presence of hCG-H (O'Connor et al., 1998; Cole et al., 1999; Butler et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2003; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Further, hCG-H accounts for >90% of all hCG at the time of implantation (Cole et al., 2003). This proportion of hCG-H steadily decreases as pregnancy progresses until it only accounts for about 2% of all hCG by the 2ndand 3rdtrimesters.

Early Pregnancy Loss

There is a correlation between low or absent levels of hCG-H in early pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss. In light of research implicating that hCG-H plays a key role in trophoblast invasion, many have suggested that the high incidence of early pregnancy loss in the absence of hCG-H is due to ineffective implantation of the zygote in the uterine lining Some studies have estimated that only 30% of all fertilized eggs continue to term to result in a live birth (Zinaman et al., 1996; Slama et al., 2002). Over the years a subset of these unsuccessful pregnancies that result from a failed implantation have been given names such as ‘occult pregnancies’, ‘preclinical pregnancies’, ‘biochemical pregnancies’, and ‘early pregnancy loss’ (Macklon et al., 2002). They all serve to describe a phenomenon whereby the conceptus is unable to successfully implant and therefore pregnancy does not progress past the first few weeks after conception. The incidence of early pregnancy loss due to failed implantation has been estimated to be about 30% of all conceptions, making it a significant occurrence in fertile individuals attempting to conceive (Wilcox et al., 1988; Macklon et al., 2002).

Fertilization of the egg typically occurs in the fallopian tube approximately 24-48 hours after ovulation. The fertilized egg (now termed a zygote) continually divides as it travels through the fallopian tube. However, its survival is not ensured until it enters the uterine cavity and implants into the uterine lining. Implantation typically occurs from about 7 to about 10 days after fertilization and is the result of several complex molecular interactions that allow the developing blastocyst to embed in the lining and eventually establish contact with nutrient enriched maternal blood (Carson et al., 2000; Enders, 2000; Norwitz et al., 2001). hCG-H has been identified as a marker whose presence (or absence) can serve to indicate if this successful implantation in the uterine lining has occurred (Cole and Khanlian, 2007).

For instance, many studies have found that an unduly low proportion (or absence) of hCG-H in early pregnancy is associated with early pregnancy losses prior to the 6thweek of gestation (O'Connor et al., 1998; Kovalevskaya et al., 2002; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Sasaki et al. (2007) recently found that in 62 successful conceptions, only those that had an hCG-H proportion greater than 50% in the first week following conception continued to term. As such, low proportions of hCG-H around the time of implantation may destine pregnancy for failure due to an unsuccessful implantation. Such studies, taken together with the abundance of choriocarcinoma data associating hCG-H with trophoblast invasion, suggest that hCG-H has an essential role in promoting the invasive properties of the conceptus resulting in successful implantation (Lei et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2007). In the absence of the implantation promoting ability of hCG-H, the conceptus may not achieve successful implantation and ultimately result in an early pregnancy loss (Kovalevskaya et al., 2007; Cole, 2007).

hCG-H and Pregnancy Testing

Traditional pregnancy tests in both the point of care (POC) and over the counter (OTC) markets are developed to detect regular or total hCG. Although both regular hCG and hCG-H can be used to measure pregnancy, they are not equal in the results that are conveyed to the consumer (Cole et al., 2007). As up to 30% of all conceptions result in early pregnancy loss (Wilcox et al., 1988), by assaying for regular hCG alone, these non-viable pregnancies are being detected and conveyed to the consumer as a successful pregnancy. As such, regular hCG can be considered a poor discriminator of pregnancies that may ultimately result in early pregnancy loss. The overwhelming majority of currently available POC and OTC pregnancy tests poorly detect hCG-H, with only a handful of tests displaying equal sensitivity to both regular hCG and hCG-H (Butler et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2004).

Another shortcoming of traditional pregnancy tests is readily realized upon consideration of women who are attempting to conceive through fertility treatments. Such women are typically administered regular hCG to mimic an LH surge and promote ovulation from mature ovarian follicles. This exogenous hCG is gradually cleared from their system over a period of about 10 days (Stenman et al., 1997), but it precludes these women from taking a traditional pregnancy test as it would result in them achieving a ‘false positive’ due to lingering exogenous hCG in their system. If these individuals were to use a pregnancy test specific for hCG-H, the exogenous regular hCG in their system would likely have no bearing on the results conveyed through the test.

Currently, there is no OTC device available that can specifically detect hCG-H. However, there is an automated chemiluminescent hCG-H assay based on the B152 antibody (Nichols Advantage immunoassay) which has been cleared by the FDA for use in pregnancy related applications (Pandain et al., 2003; Weinans et al., 2005). While it is specific for hCG-H, this test requires a long sample incubation time of about 4 hours. Thus, this test must be run in a laboratory setting in order to achieve results (Cole et al., 2004). As many doctors advise women who achieve a positive pregnancy test result at home to wait for at least 6 weeks prior to scheduling a visit, the use of the laboratory based assay to detect hCG-H is not practical as those with unsuccessful implantation related to a low prevalence of hCG-H may have already suffered an early pregnancy loss prior to the doctor's visit. The development of an at home hCG-H based pregnancy test would rapidly convey to the consumer that not only are they pregnant, but that their odds for early pregnancy loss resulting from failed implantation are significantly reduced.

There remains a need for both POC and OTC pregnancy test devices that can selectively or preferentially detect hCG-H. There also remains a need for a pregnancy test device exhibiting an improved level of accuracy for determining the viability of a pregnancy.

SUBJECT OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a cosmetic depilatory composition, which comprises a hydrocarbon resin and a flexibilizer or plasticizer, that can be used for cold depilation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Presently, in both domestic and professional settings, wax depilation is one of the methods most often used for removing hair from different areas of the body to achieve the desired aesthetic and hygienic objectives.

For this purpose, hot, warm or cold waxes are used, which adhere firmly to the hair and permit it to be pulled out together with the hair follicle (commonly described as “by the root”).

Hot waxes are solid at room temperature, are heated until they reach a sticky liquid state, and are applied using a spatula or special applicator. The applied hot waxes are allowed to cool and are peeled off.

Warm waxes are semisolid at room temperature, are slightly heated until they reach a sticky liquid state, and are applied using a spatula or special applicator. The warm waxes must be removed with the aid of strips of nonwoven cloth, cellophane or other materials.

Cold waxes are semi-solid at room temperature, are sold preapplied to strips of non-woven cloth, cellophane or other materials. These strips with preapplied wax are applied directly without need of heating and are peeled off. At the present time, the composition of these cold waxes is based on colophony (pine resin), colophony derivatives, paraffin, silica, oils, microcrystalline waxes, beeswax or polymers, among other ingredients, which fulfill different functions in the formulation of cold wax. The main components (those responsible for the adhesion) are colophony and its derivatives. Colophony is a solid, dark brown or yellowish resin, obtained as a residue from the distillation of turpentine. Due to the intrinsic nature of pine resin and its derivatives, cold waxes acquire a characteristic odor (typical of colophony and reminiscent of turpentine) and color (dark golden-brown) that make it difficult or impossible to color and perfume as demanded by cosmetic market trends. There also exist on the market some cold waxes based on glucose and other saccharides derived from sugar, which in the manufacturing process acquire a characteristic odor (burnt sugar) and color (dark golden-brown) that also make it difficult or impossible to color and perfume as demanded by cosmetic market trends.

The present invention describes a cosmetic depilatory composition of odorless, colorless, transparent cold wax, which can be easily colored and perfumed, permitting the development of more aesthetic and sophisticated products, in line with the cosmetic trends of the current market.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C.];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a condom whereby the condom possesses one or more textured rings, spirals, dots, images, or raised surfaces with the intention of providing a “pleasure bump” or visual cue for increasing stimulation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There has developed around rubber latex a substantial industry for producing such articles as condoms, rubber gloves, surgical supplies, balloons, bathing caps and countless other articles. The articles are generally produced by dipping glass, porcelain or metal mandrels into natural rubber latex baths and subsequently coagulating and curing the thin film of latex, which adheres to the mandrel. Thicker films are obtained by repeating the dipping, coagulating and curing operations as desired. The films are stripped from the mandrels and may optionally be further cured at elevated temperatures.

Normally a condom is made of strong, fine rubber, fine animal membrane or a synthetic polymer such as polyurethane. Of necessity, in order to provide an acceptable level of tactile stimulation to the wearer, the condom must be quite thin. In general, it is elastically fitted to the male organ and during coitus remains stretch and taut.

The traditional methods of manufacturing a contraceptive, prophylactic or condom involve the so-called straight dipping or dip and dry techniques wherein a phallic shaped mandrel of predetermined size is, optionally coated with a coagulating agent, and dipped into a bath containing natural rubber latex or a solution of synthetic polymer such as polyurethane. The mandrel when dipped may be stationary or rotating about its longitudinal axis. The mandrel is then removed from the bath, dried and cured. This process can be repeated several times until a condom of the desired thickness properties are achieved. During dipping, the mandrel is immersed to a depth sufficient to yield the finished condom of desired length plus an additional distance to allow for rolling the sheath on itself for several turns in order to form a ring at the open end of the condom. Following a final cure, the formed condom may be coated with an anti-tack material such as talc, micro-porous solid particles, lubricants, slip agents, spermicides, deodorants, etc., prior to removal from the mandrel.

After completion of the dipping, ring-forming, curing and optional coating steps, the condom is removed from the mandrel, and optionally subjected to additional drying, further curing, and quality testing. Prior to packaging, the condoms are quality tested and rolled to form a cup-shaped elastic ring of predetermined size and circumference. At this point, additional lubricants, spermicides, bactericides, etc., may also be added to the condom. In this form, the condom is easily mountable for use during sexual intercourse by unrolling onto the penis.

Currently, condoms are manufactured under the Trojan Brand™ name, as well as other names with ribbed features. These ribbed features are typically made by dipping a mandrel with an etched surface into a latex bath. Latex deposits on the surface of the dipped mandrel to form the basic condom shape, while the latex that deposits in the etchings leaves behind a ribbed feature on the finished condom exterior.

However through trial and error, it has been determined that for a condom having a typical mid-point thickness of 0.075 mm, the maximum height that can be accomplished by the above mentioned technique is only about 0.1 mm or less. Such height usually does not provide much sensation to the condom user or partner. Attempting to make features with a greater height, through deeper etching of the condom mandrel, results in the formation of unacceptable weak spots on the condom. Broader (wider) raised patterns are also problematic. Latex tends to form a uniform coating in a broadly etched section of the mandrel rather than filling the void. This results in the pattern being lost once the condom is removed from the mandrel.

By using a grooved mandrel on which condoms are manufactured by a dip molding process, it is possible to produce condoms with ribs that are claimed to heighten stimulation during coitus. However, the ribs on such condoms produced by the known method are not effectively positioned or lack sufficient structural rigidity to produce effective clitoral and labial stimulation, and the production of pronounced ribbing by shaping of the mandrel weakens the structural integrity of the condom which is plainly unacceptable.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,661 to Solanki et al discloses a method for producing condom having monolithic projections to promote stimulation of clitoris. Specifically, Solanki et al. apply the projections between dips to a pre-deposited latex sheath. However such method substantially slows down the production speed, and the ability to manufacture a wider array of projections onto condoms is limited. Therefore, there remains a need for an efficient method of producing such condoms having projections greater than 0.1 mm in height to produce stimulation,

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A method of manufacturing a condom comprising: 1) applying latex (as is or thickened with some agent) or another latex compatible vehicle directly to the surface of the condom mandrel to produce a raised pattern akin to bas relief; 2), drying the applied pattern, dipping the patterned mandrel in latex one or more times (over dip) to form a condom containing the raised pattern.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is related to devices that can selectively detect hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-H) for detecting pregnancy in a woman. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of evaluating the viability of a pregnancy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta soon after fertilization. This hormone has the crucial role of maintaining steroid production by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, and ensures that pregnancy progresses unabated. Thus, the detection of hCG has been utilized as a marker for pregnancy in women. Accordingly, measurement of hCG in blood or urine has been the basis of prior and current pregnancy tests or devices.

hCG

More specifically, the hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit is unique. However, there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity (Pierce and Parsons, 1981; Stenman et al., 2006).

hCG has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa. About one-third of this mass is due to glycosylation consisting of 8 oligosaccharide chains covalently bound to the alpha and beta subunits (Pierce and Parsons, 1981). It is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells following fertilization and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy (Hoshina et al., 1985; Lustbader et al., 1998). During excretion, intact hCG can be partially degraded into its component subunits allowing different variants of hCG to be detected in liquid samples, such as urine.

As is well known, the association of hCG and pregnancy was first reported in 1927. During the 1960's, the advent of immunoassays allowed the direct detection of hCG in pregnancy urine (Wide and Gemzell, 1960; Vaitukaitis et al., 1972). A variety of different hCG isoforms or fragments are present in both serum and urine. Intact hCG has been discovered to be the predominant form of hCG and have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy despite the presence of the other isoforms detected include free hCG alpha subunit, free hCG beta subunit, hCG beta core fragment, nicked hCG, and hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) (O'Connor et al., 1994; McChesney et al., 2005).

hCG-H

Although intact hCG is the most prevalent form of the molecule found throughout pregnancy, other distinct isoforms have emerged with different biological activities. One such form, hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H), differs from regular hCG in the amount of and/or location of oligosaccharide chains present on the beta subunit of hCG. This different glycosylation pattern is believed to alter the function of the molecule such that hCG-H provides a role in promoting implantation of a developing zygote.

Whereas hCG production is typically considered to be limited to pregnancy, it has also been found to be produced in certain types of invasive cancer associated with gestational trophoblastic disease (Cole et al., 2006). These tumors (hytatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumors) are both aggressive and malignant, and a key marker for their presence is the production of hCG (particularly the beta subunit of hCG) in the absence of pregnancy (Cole et al., 2003). Research into hCG produced by choriocarcinoma tumor cells identified that there were significant weight differences in hCG derived from choriocarcinoma when compared to hCG present in pregnancy (˜40 kDa compared to ˜37 kDa) (Hussa, 1977; Mizuochi et al., 1983; Amano et al., 1988). Further studies on the choriocarcinoma derived hCG elucidated that the weight differences were due to excess glycosylation leading to significantly larger oligosaccharides on the beta subunit (Elliott et al., 1997). The term hyperglycosylated hCG, or hCG-H, was coined for this higher molecular weight choriocarcinoma derived hCG containing invasive properties, with regular hCG reserved for the hCG with normal oligosaccharide chains found during pregnancy (Elliott et al., 1997; Cole et al., 1998).

Previously researchers developed an hCG-H monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with hCG-H produced by a single patient with choriocarcinoma. This antibody, B152, specifically recognized choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H in both serum and urine. This allowed researchers to more effectively screen and monitor the presence of hCG-H. Subsequent studies utilizing the B152 antibody found that hCG-H is not only produced by choriocarcinoma, but it is also found in very early pregnancy as well (O'Connor et al., 1998), and that hCG-H is the predominant form of hCG produced by cytotrophoblast cells at the time of trophoblast invasion irrespective if the invasion is associated with choriocarcinoma or pregnancy (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Cytotrophoblast cells differ from those that produce regular hCG (syncytiotrophoblast cells), and they confer a different function to hCG-H that is closely linked with the implantation of the zygote into the uterine lining after conception (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Studies have also shown that hCG-H cannot replace the corpus luteum stimulating activity of regular hCG which suggests a distinct biological activity for hCG-H separate from that of pregnancy promoting function of regular hCG (Cole et al., 1991).

Early pregnancy derived hCG-H has the same molecular weight as choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H (Kovalesyskaya et al., 2002), and the majority of all hCG immunoreactivity in serum and urine samples from early pregnancy is due to the presence of hCG-H (O'Connor et al., 1998; Cole et al., 1999; Butler et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2003; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Further, hCG-H accounts for >90% of all hCG at the time of implantation (Cole et al., 2003). This proportion of hCG-H steadily decreases as pregnancy progresses until it only accounts for about 2% of all hCG by the 2ndand 3rdtrimesters.

Early Pregnancy Loss

There is a correlation between low or absent levels of hCG-H in early pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss. In light of research implicating that hCG-H plays a key role in trophoblast invasion, many have suggested that the high incidence of early pregnancy loss in the absence of hCG-H is due to ineffective implantation of the zygote in the uterine lining. Some studies have estimated that only 30% of all fertilized eggs continue to term to result in a live birth (Zinaman et al., 1996; Slama et al., 2002). Over the years a subset of these unsuccessful pregnancies that result from a failed implantation have been given names such as ‘occult pregnancies’, ‘preclinical pregnancies’, ‘biochemical pregnancies’, and ‘early pregnancy loss’ (Macklon et al., 2002). They all serve to describe a phenomenon whereby the conceptus is unable to successfully implant and therefore pregnancy does not progress past the first few weeks after conception. The incidence of early pregnancy loss due to failed implantation has been estimated to be about 30% of all conceptions, making it a significant occurrence in fertile individuals attempting to conceive (Wilcox et al., 1988; Macklon et al., 2002).

Fertilization of the egg typically occurs in the fallopian tube approximately 24-48 hours after ovulation. The fertilized egg (now termed a zygote) continually divides as it travels through the fallopian tube. However, its survival is not ensured until it enters the uterine cavity and implants into the uterine lining. Implantation typically occurs from about 7 to about 10 days after fertilization and is the result of several complex molecular interactions that allow the developing blastocyst to embed in the lining and eventually establish contact with nutrient enriched maternal blood (Carson et al., 2000; Enders, 2000; Norwitz et al., 2001). hCG-H has been identified as a marker whose presence (or absence) can serve to indicate if this successful implantation in the uterine lining has occurred (Cole and Khanlian, 2007).

For instance, many studies have found that an unduly low proportion (or absence) of hCG-H in early pregnancy is associated with early pregnancy losses prior to the 6thweek of gestation (O'Connor et al., 1998; Kovalevskaya et al., 2002; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Sasaki et al. (2007) recently found that in 62 successful conceptions, only those that had an hCG-H proportion greater than 50% in the first week following conception continued to term. As such, low proportions of hCG-H around the time of implantation may destine pregnancy for failure due to an unsuccessful implantation. Such studies, taken together with the abundance of choriocarcinoma data associating hCG-H with trophoblast invasion, suggest that hCG-H has an essential role in promoting the invasive properties of the conceptus resulting in successful implantation (Lei et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2007). In the absence of the implantation promoting ability of hCG-H, the conceptus may not achieve successful implantation and ultimately result in an early pregnancy loss (Kovalevskaya et al., 2007; Cole, 2007).

hCG-H and Pregnancy Testing

Traditional pregnancy tests in both the point of care (POC) and over the counter (OTC) markets are developed to detect regular or total hCG. Although both regular hCG and hCG-H can be used to measure pregnancy, they are not equal in the results that are conveyed to the consumer (Cole et al., 2007). As up to 30% of all conceptions result in early pregnancy loss (Wilcox et al., 1988), by assaying for regular hCG alone, these non-viable pregnancies are being detected and conveyed to the consumer as a successful pregnancy. As such, regular hCG can be considered a poor discriminator of pregnancies that may ultimately result in early pregnancy loss. The overwhelming majority of currently available POC and OTC pregnancy tests poorly detect hCG-H, with only a handful of tests displaying equal sensitivity to both regular hCG and hCG-H (Butler et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2004).

Another shortcoming of traditional pregnancy tests is readily realized upon consideration of women who are attempting to conceive through fertility treatments. Such women are typically administered regular hCG to mimic an LH surge and promote ovulation from mature ovarian follicles. This exogenous hCG is gradually cleared from their system over a period of about 10 days (Stenman et al., 1997), but it precludes these women from taking a traditional pregnancy test as it would result in them achieving a ‘false positive’ due to lingering exogenous hCG in their system. If these individuals were to use a pregnancy test specific for hCG-H, the exogenous regular hCG in their system would likely have no bearing on the results conveyed through the test.

Currently, there is no OTC device available that can specifically detect hCG-H. However, there is an automated chemiluminescent hCG-H assay based on the B152 antibody (Nichols Advantage immunoassay) which has been cleared by the FDA for use in pregnancy related applications (Pandain et al., 2003; Weinans et al., 2005). While it is specific for hCG-H, this test requires a long sample incubation time of about 4 hours. Thus, this test must be run in a laboratory setting in order to achieve results (Cole et al., 2004). As many doctors advise women who achieve a positive pregnancy test result at home to wait for at least 6 weeks prior to scheduling a visit, the use of the laboratory based assay to detect hCG-H is not practical as those with unsuccessful implantation related to a low prevalence of hCG-H may have already suffered an early pregnancy loss prior to the doctor's visit. The development of an at home hCG-H based pregnancy test would rapidly convey to the consumer that not only are they pregnant, but that their odds for early pregnancy loss resulting from failed implantation are significantly reduced.

There remains a need for both POC and OTC pregnancy test devices that can selectively or preferentially detect hCG-H. There also remains a need for a pregnancy test device exhibiting an improved level of accuracy for determining the viability of a pregnancy.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to devices for treating a surface, and more particularly a surface treating device adapted for treating stains from articles composed of fabrics and textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs, and upholstery.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Household furnishings and textile-based materials such as, for example, carpets, rugs, and upholstery, can last for many years, when properly treated. Routine vacuuming and regular cleaning helps to maintain the appearance and useful life of such materials. Occasional spills and stains do occur even in the most carefully maintained homes. Such stains are typically the result of a chemical reaction between the staining agent and the fibers and finishes of a fabric or textile-based material. Many stains can be treated with the proper method or technique.

Generally, the stain treatment process must be implemented immediately to prevent the stain from setting permanently in the material. The treatment process for the stains involves applying a stain-treating agent or a solvent for the stain, blotting the affected area with a cloth or sponge and/or tamping the stain with a spoon until the stain is treated. It is generally suggested that vigorous scrubbing and rubbing be avoided. Such action can irreparably damage or prematurely wear the material or spread the stain to a larger area or even push the stain deeper into the material. Unfortunately, consumers often fail to follow the suggestion against scrubbing or rubbing the stained material.

There are several motorized cleaning devices available marketed for removing stains entrenched in fabric and textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs and upholstery. Such devices typically include a drive train including a shaft. The shaft coupled to a bristle holder, may rotate, oscillate or reciprocate, and imparting a scrubbing or rubbing action. Accordingly, such prior art devices are not suitable for treating strains without causing some degree of damage or wear.

A number of compositions are formulated for treating stains. Consumers generally prefer stain treating compositions which contain or generate gas bubbles. One such composition is formulated from solutions of baking soda (i.e., sodium bicarbonate) and a peroxide compound (e.g., hydrogen peroxide). The peroxide component and the baking soda component chemically react to produce an effervescent action effective for treating stains. The composition does not produce potentially odorous and/or irritating chemicals that may leave a residue or rings after use. The major drawback to using peroxide/baking soda compositions is the inconvenience associated with handling multiple components. Because the two components are reactive on contact, they must be kept separate from one another during storage, and mixed in appropriate proportions immediately before application to the stain.

Accordingly, there is a need for a surface treating device that is designed to treat stains from fabric or textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs and upholstery, while avoiding the problems described above. There is a need for a surface treating device that operates in a manner consistent with accepted stain treating practices, and substantially minimizes damage or wear to the treated area of the material. There is a further need for a surface treating device capable of conveniently preparing and delivering a stain treating fluid formulated in proper amounts from one or more components to the surface of the material.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a surface treating device for treating stains from fabric and textile-based materials including carpets, rugs and upholstery. The surface treating device of the present invention is specifically designed to provide enhanced handling with minimal operational difficulties, while avoiding or at least substantially minimizing damage and wear to the material. The surface treating device includes a member adapted for engaging a surface to be treated in a manner, which enhances treatment without damage or excessive wear. A driver is operatively associated with the member, and is adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the member engages the surface in a substantially perpendicular manner (i.e., a tamping motion). The member may be in the form of a brush having a plurality of bristles. The surface treating device of the present invention is portable, hand-holdable, and simple and convenient to use. Furthermore, the surface treating device of the present invention is compact in size for easy storage and handling, and is especially suitable for consumer use.

The surface treating device of the present invention may further include a single fluid source for storing a fluid or multiple separate discrete fluid sources for storing a plurality of fluids and for combining the fluids in a convenient manner. The single or combination of fluids is delivered to the treatable material in proximity of the cleaning member. Preferably, in one embodiment of the present invention, the multiple discrete fluid sources comprise a peroxide fluid such as an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in one, and a bicarbonate fluid such as an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution in another. These fluid sources are maintained out of contact with one another (storage phase) until the combined fluid is used to clean a selected material. The discrete fluid sources may each be in the form of a pouch for facilitating easy replacement. The surface treating device of the present invention facilitates treatment of stains through both chemical and mechanical action. Accordingly, the surface treating device of the present invention offers a convenient self-contained comprehensive system for treating stains.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surface treating device, comprising:

a member adapted for engaging a surface to be treated;

a driver operatively associated with the member, the driver being adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the member engages the surface to be treated in a manner substantially perpendicular to the surface to be treated; and

a dispenser for delivering a fluid, drawn directly from a discrete fluid source, to the surface being treated.

In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surface treating device, comprising:

a member having a plurality of bristles adapted for engaging a surface to be treated; and

a driver operatively associated with the member, the driver being adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the bristles engage the surface to be treated in a manner substantially perpendicular to the surface to be treated.

In a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a fitment for a pouch for storing one of the fluids, comprising:

a valve portion for permitting passage of a fluid therethrough;

a fitment body housing the valve portion, the fitment body being adapted for attachment to a pouch; and

a throughhole extending laterally through the fitment body in communication with the interior of the pouch for permitting any gas present in the pouch to pass out of the pouch while at least substantially preventing passage of a liquid therethrough.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pouch comprising:

a flexible wall defining a fluid cavity for accommodating a fluid; and

a fitment comprising:a) a valve portion for permitting passage of a fluid therethrough from the fluid cavity;b) a fitment body housing the valve portion, the fitment body being adapted for attachment through the flexible wall of the pouch; andc) a throughhole extending laterally through the fitment body in communication with the fluid cavity for permitting any gas present in the pouch to pass out of the pouch while at least substantially preventing passage of a liquid therethrough.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plug comprising:

a tubular body having first and second ends, the first end configured for engaging a throughhole extending laterally through a fitment;

a laterally inclined opening located at the second end of the tubular body; and

a gas permeable membrane sealing the laterally inclined opening.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a pre-assembled cap and spout which provides for spout orientation, sealing, and locking when applied to a container. Moreover, the pre-assembled cap of the present invention is useful as a cap and spout for liquid laundry detergent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Molded thermoplastic containers have found wide application in the packaging of liquid detergents, fabric softeners, and other viscous liquid products. Conventional closures employed in such containers include anti-drip pour spouts and cooperating dosing caps. Typically, a pour spout fitment is fastened within a dispensing opening in the container and enclosed with an overlying cap which can serve as a measuring cup. Flow restrictor and drainage features are provided in the fitment by provision of inclined base members in the fitment which include openings that communicate with the container interior.

Conventional dispenser closures used for pouring the container contents often consist of three components, an inner sleeve which is friction-fit to the inside of the neck of the container, a spout portion which is normally snap-fit into the sleeve so that the spout projects vertically beyond the upper margins of the sleeve and the container neck, and a cap portion which is threaded onto the neck and may often serve as a measuring cup. This type of closure is commonly used for containers of liquid household laundry detergent and related products, although the closure of the invention is not restricted to any specific type of application.

For example, Davidson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,009 discloses a package having a spout-containing fitment wherein external threads on the package finish cooperate with internal threads on a closure/measuring cup. The Davidson et al. bottle includes a locking circumferential ridge on an inner peripheral surface of the upper end portion of the bottle fitment (see FIGS. 9 and 10), which retains the fitment.

Baxter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,189 is directed to a container for viscous fluids having an insert provided with a pouring lip. A cover includes a flange to engage a flange on the fitment when the cover is closed. As seen in FIG. 4, inner aspects of the finish appear to extend inwardly against the fitment and cover. The finish has outwardly extending threads cooperating with inwardly extending threads of a cap.

Bavegems, U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,566 discloses a transition piece having internal threads cooperating with external threads on a container finish. The transition piece includes a spout. The patent mentions that by attaching the transition piece by a screw head, if the user prefers not to use the pouring spout, but prefers to fill it by the free neck opening, this can be done easily by unscrewing the transition piece. The preferred embodiment is said to disclose a refill facilitating pouring spout which is part of a transition piece with inside screw head for fastening to the container cap.

Li, U.S. Pat. No. 4,706,829 discloses a dispensing package including a bottle finish having outwardly extending threads mating with a cap having inwardly extending threads. A pour spout-containing fitment is mounted on the bottle finish.

Moore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,251,788 discloses a closure having interior threads designed to engage exterior threads on a spout body. The spout body includes internal threading which mates with external threading on the container finish.

Ekkert et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,467 is directed to a container having an externally threaded finish which mates with an internally threaded finish of a closure. A fitment having a radially extending flange is inserted within the mouth of the container and the radially extending flange rests upon the top of the finish. The arrangement is such that the amount of residual contents left within the container is said to be diminished. The illustrated spout fitment appears to have substantial areas open for product to flow through, relative to the area defined by the outer spout wall.

Haga et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,770 discloses a package having outer threads mating with inner threads of an adapter which has a pour spout. The adapter has outer threads which mate with inner threads on a closure. The closure includes a flange which rests on a portion of the adapter.

Haffner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,462,202 is directed to a liquid dispensing fitment which rests on an upper edge of the container finish. The container finish includes outside extending screws which mate with inwardly extending screws on the closure. The fitment includes a pour spout.

Fuchs et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,269 discloses a package having a neck comprising an upwardly extending integral dispensing spout. Internal threads on the container finish cooperate with external threads on the closure. The closure also includes an annular flexible sealing ring and a second sealing ring.

Moore et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,772 discloses a dispensing package including a finish having outer threads which mate with inner threads on a spout fitment. The spout fitment also has outer threads which mate with inner threads on a closure.

Reiber et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,421 discloses a plastic blow molded container having an annular finish and an insert positioned in the finish and interengaged with the internal surface of the finish. The insert has internal threads for receiving a closure which may be in the form of a self draining measuring cup having external threads on the lower end thereof and a peripheral flange sealingly engaging the free end of the finish. In one form, the insert is placed in position while the finish is hot, and when the finish cools it shrinks into sealing engagement with the finish. In another form, the insert is spin welded into sealing engagement with the finish. Alternatively, an adhesive may be used.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,862 shows a liquid product pouring and measuring package having a measuring cup which also serves as the closure for the package. The package includes a container including a container body with an upwardly extending finish and a dispensing orifice. A transition collar is mounted on the container finish and has a pouring spout and a circumscribing wall with fastening means on its interior surface. A measuring cup serves as a closure for the package and includes outwardly disposed fastening means adapted to mate with the inwardly facing fastening means on the transition collar to attach the measuring cup in the inverted position to the transition collar and thereby provide a closure for the package.

Locking teeth can be provided on the inner periphery of the transition collar to mate with locking teeth on the container finish so that the transition collar, when mounted on the container finish, will not rotate. However, a more secure engagement between the transition collar and the container finish can be provided by a glued engagement. The glued engagement provides a firm and rigid interlocking between the container finish and transition collar.

However, it would be desirable to provide an improved package including the container and transition collar with firm interlocking between these components. The improved package would include a measuring cup mounted onto the transition collar, wherein for example the resultant interlock between the container and collar will allow the measuring cup to be removed and replaced without causing rotation of the collar. This should desirably be accomplished with a glued, interlocked engagement and with a reasonable cost and with a minimum amount of glue.

It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide an improved package for liquids including a container for housing liquids and a transition collar having a pouring spout firmly mounted on the container finish.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved package as aforesaid including a measuring cup mounted on the transition collar, wherein the measuring cup can be removed and replaced without causing rotation of the collar.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the correct spout orientation, sealing, and locking when applied to the container.

Further objects and advantages of the present invention will appear hereinbelow.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a dispensing and closing package for a liquid comprising a container or bottle, and a cap and spout closure. Moreover, the invention consists of a cap and notched spout closure designed to mate with a lugged container or bottle neck which allows the spout to be oriented and locked to prevent removal by the customer. In one embodiment, the lugs are located on the parting lines of the bottle, thereby allowing for more plastic to be used in the lug formation, and thus, providing more durable lugs. In another embodiment, the lugs are dovetail shaped, which, when mated to corresponding dovetail shaped notches, create a very strong mechanism to prevent over-torquing during assembly or inadvertent spout removal. In yet another embodiment, the cap and spout closure contains a flexible band spout seal which has been created in such a way that it will prevent product leakage and conform to the top of the bottle, even when the bottle is not perfectly trimmed, or trimmed to differing heights.

The cap and spout of the present invention allows for receipt of empty bottles in a bulk, oriented, palletized format without the cap and spout closure pre-assembled onto the container of bottle. The bottles can be filled prior to installation of the oriented cap and spout and closure.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a method of stripping paint and ink from a substrate. The stripper comprises an aqueous phase and an organic phase.

With the introduction of new and more durable types of synthetic resins and polymers in protective and decorative coatings, the problem of stripping has become increasingly difficult. Prior art paint removers typically contain blends of aromatic solvents, ketones, paraffin, methanol and diluents, for example, mineral spirits in order to reduce raw material costs. Those prior art strippers made with the foregoing solvents focused industry attention on the flammable and toxic characteristics.

As an alternative, improved prior art solvents utilize chlorinated solvents as a way to extend the usefulness of paint strippers while simultaneously reducing fire hazards associated with their use. Methylene chloride (dichloromethane) has been almost universally used as the solvent of choice, although some compositions have been formulated with ethylene dichloride and trichloroethylene, among other chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. Many of the chlorinated hydrocarbons including methylene chloride are suspected carcinogens and methylene chloride is designated a hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substance Act (FHSA). In addition, methylene chloride, as a high vapor pressure chlorinated solvent, probably contributes to atmospheric ozone depletion. Methanol is a poison if ingested and the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission requires a warning designating it as a poison when its concentration in consumer products exceeds 4 percent by weight. Toluene contains trace quantities of benzene, a known carcinogen, and acetone with its high vapor pressure and low flash point is highly flammable.

Paint strippers which include methylene chloride can be formulated to soften, lift and blister paint films. The stripper which is applied to the substrate by brush, immersion or spray and allowed to loosen the paint or varnish has an available work life of only several minutes because of the tendency of the methylene chloride to evaporate rapidly. Because of the high vapor pressure of methylene chloride, in an effort to extend the work life of the stripper made with that solvent, paraffin is often included as an evaporation suppressant. The paraffin functions by forming a thin film at the surface of the paint remover which retards evaporation. This thin film formation and resultant evaporation suppressant activity of paraffin is produced by the evaporation and surface chilling which occur when methylene chloride or mixtures containing methylene chloride are exposed to air. However, methylene chloride strippers must be handled carefully since they are highly toxic and can cause severe skin irritation. Further, even with the incorporation of paraffin, the volatility of the methylene chloride is still very high and when methylene chloride is formulated with, for example, toluene, the resulting high levels of hydrocarbon emissions necessitate the provision of good ventilation to safely use the methylene chloride paint strippers.

A further disadvantage of paint strippers formulated with methylene chloride is that the short work life compromises the ability of the stripper to function efficiently in many applications. For example, many industrial uses of paint strippers involve stripping accumulated paint from equipment and walls. Paint strippers utilizing methylene chloride suffer from the disadvantage that the short work life prevents the stripper from entering crevices in the accumulated paint layers thus creating the necessity, in some cases, of applying a large number of applications of stripper to remove a number of accumulated paint layers.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107, issued Feb. 19, 2002, discloses a new method of stripping paint from a painted substrate surface. According to the invention, the surface is contacted with the aqueous phase of a two-phase liquid stripper composition comprising an aqueous phase which comprises water, dissolved water-soluble activator compound, and an organic solvent which has a solubility in water in the range 0.1 to 10% by weight at 20° C., the organic solvent being present in the aqueous phase at a concentration of about the saturation level (as at the ambient conditions for the method) and comprising also an organic phase comprising the said organic solvent, which organic phase is in interfacial contact with the aqueous phase. The organic solvent may include chlorinated hydrocarbons, for instance in combination with other organic solvents.

Suitable organic solvents for use in U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107 include benzyl alcohol, methylene chloride, dibasic ester, which is an oxygenated solvent composed of a mixture of methyldiesters of glutaric, succinic and adipic acids, or ethyl-3-ethoxy propionate. The dissolved activator compound present in the aqueous phase of the composition may be any compound which increases the paint stripper activity. Such compound may often be a pH modifying compound in the form of an acid. Acid activators are usually organic acids, for instance trichloroacetic, alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, benzoic or lactic acid. The pH modifying compound can also be an alkali, for instance, alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal silicates, and organic basic compounds such as amines or ammonium compounds. Another category of activator compound is an oxidizing agent. Examples of an oxidizing agent include hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate.

It is known to use water as an activator compound in organic solvent based paint strippers. Such compositions tend to have low levels of water, for instance less than 10%. Other paint stripper compositions comprising both water and organic solvents which are immiscible with water have been described. Generally emulsifiers are added in quantities such that an emulsion of one phase in the other phase is formed. Such emulsions are storage stable and are required not to separate before use. Alternatively, co-solvents may be added to create a homogeneous single phase system.

Single phase paint strippers containing ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate and additional solvents such as esters, ethers, alcohols, or pyrrolidones such as N-methylpyrrolidone are known and exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,288,335 and 5,449,474. Alkylene carbonate solvents, along with hydrogen peroxide, in an aqueous-based system are disclosed in a series of patents assigned to Huntsman Petrochemical Corporation. Examples of these are U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,040,284; 6,162,776; 6,369,009; and 6,608,012, among others.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a paint and ink remover composition in the form of two phases: an organic phase and an aqueous phase. Preferably, the phases are separated, but in interfacial contact as in aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107. The immiscible (i.e., only partially soluble) organic solvent and water are not in the form of an emulsion, but still provide a very effective paint and ink stripper. Additionally, an acceptable paint and ink remover can be obtained by mixing the two phases and including hydrotropes to provide a single-phase system.

The organic phase comprises a mixture of organic solvents, including an alkylene carbonate, dibasic esters, and alcohol, while the aqueous phase includes a unique basic activator comprising aminoalkyl alkanols, which have previously been used as an ingredient in metal working fluids. The amino alcohol activators of the present invention have not been classified as hazardous pollutants. This invention relates to an environmentally friendly and extremely effective paint and ink remover compared to the prior art.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a process for the production of ethanol by fermentation. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a process to improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The production of alcoholic beverages by the fermentation of fruit and grains is of ancient origin. In more recent times, the isolation of ethanol in concentrated or in pure form for use either in beverages, in industry, or as fuel, has assumed considerable importance. In general, ethanol may be produced by the fermentation of simple sugars such as glucose and fructose and oligosaccharides such as sucrose. Such substances and mixtures thereof which, without prior chemical modification, are convertible to ethanol will be referred to herein as “fermentable carbohydrates.” More complex carbohydrates such as starches and cellulosic materials also may be converted to ethanol by fermentation, but usually only after they are degraded to lower molecular weight sugars or related materials. The fermentation proceeds in an anaerobic environment, with production of carbon dioxide by-product. The Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., presents a condensed summary of the state of the art of producing and isolating fermentation-ethanol in Volume 9, at pages 352-361, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Ethanol has widespread application as an industrial chemical, gasoline additive or straight liquid fuel. As a fuel or fuel additive, ethanol dramatically reduces air emissions while improving engine performance. As a renewable fuel, ethanol reduces national dependence on finite and largely foreign fossil fuel sources while decreasing the net accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

In contrast to energy production by combustion of fossil fuels, energy production by combustion of contemporary biomass (predominantly in the form of harvested plant material) or fuels derived from such biomass is regarded as being “CO2-neutral”, since the amount of CO2released by combustion of a given amount of such biomass corresponds to the amount of CO2which was originally taken up from the atmosphere during the build-up of that amount of biomass.

Among fuels derived from plant biomass, ethanol has received particular attention as a potential replacement for or supplement to petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon products. To minimize the production cost of ethanol produced from biomass (also referred to in the following as “bioethanol”) it is important to use biomass in the form of low-cost by-products from gardening, agriculture, forestry, the timber industry and the like; thus, for example, materials such as straw, maize stems, forestry waste (log slash, bark, small branches, twigs and the like), sawdust and wood-chips are all materials which can be employed to produce bioethanol.

Biomass typically includes materials containing cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein and carbohydrates such as starch and sugar. Common forms of biomass include trees, shrubs and grasses, corn and corn husks as well as municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. Biomass high in starch, sugar or protein such as corn, grains, fruits and vegetables are usually consumed as food. Conversely, biomass high in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are not readily digestible and are primarily utilized for wood and paper products, fuel, or are disposed of.

Biomass contains two basic constituents, carbohydrates and lignin. The carbohydrate content of the biomass contains cellulose and hemicellulose. Both cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugars of glucose and xylose. Fermentation converts glucose and xylose to ethanol using enzymes produced by microorganisms, for example, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,210. Control of nutrients, pH, temperature, sugar concentration, and microorganism concentration all affect rate of fermentation to form ethanol. When ethanol concentration reaches above about 6 to 12%, ethanol concentration can be lethal to the microorganisms employed for fermentation. To reduce ethanol concentration within broth employed for fermentation and maintain activity of microorganisms, extraction of ethanol from the broth by solvents non-toxic to microorganisms, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,110,319, 4,865,973 and No. 4,517,298. The operations disclosed require energy for vaporization of ethanol and subsequent condensation to produce liquid ethanol.

The various operations in processes for obtaining ethanol from such recurring sources as cellulose, cane sugar, amylaceous gains and tubers, e.g., the separation of starch granules from non-carbohydrate plant matter and other extraneous substances, the acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and/or cellulose to fermentable sugar (saccharification), the fermentation of sugar to a dilute solution of ethanol and the recovery of anhydrous ethanol by distillation, have been modified in numerous ways to achieve improvements in product yield, production rates and so forth. For ethanol to realize its vast potential as a partial or total substitute for petroleum fuels or as a substitute chemical feedstock, it is necessary that the manufacturing process be as efficient in the use of energy and raw materials as possible so as to maximize the energy return for the amount of ethanol produced and enhance the standing of the ethanol as an economically viable replacement for petroleum-based chemicals. To date, however, relatively little concern has been given to the energy requirements for manufacturing ethanol from biomass and consequently, little effort has been made to minimize the thermal expenditure for carrying out any of the discrete operations involved in the manufacture of ethanol from vegetative sources.

There are three basic methods known for accelerating the fermentation rates of a sugar media to ethanol. These methods include 1) increasing the cell density, and/or 2) reducing the concentration of inhibitory compound(s) (with ethanol being most inhibitory due to its osmolality and toxic effects) in the media as suggested by Dale in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,027 and 5,141,861. The third method is to control the growth environment; such as with trace elements, vitamins, amino acid, pH, and temperature (Biology of Microorganisms, 7thedition, Brock, Madigan, Martinko and Parler. Prenitice Hall, New Jersey 1994). During a normal batch ethanol fermentation with standardS. cerevisaestrains, a final cell concentration of between 1.5 and 15 g/l cells is achieved. It is often noted that cell growth completely stops after a certain cell density is reached (Holzberg et al, 1967). The oxygen tension in the fermentation is important in these batch fermentations, as the cells will convert a larger fraction of the sugar substrate towards cell mass production as the amount of oxygen available to the cells increases. Trace oxygen can serve as a nutrient during the anaerobic fermentation of sugars, allowing more cell production that results in a greater fermentation rate of sugar to ethanol. Cysewski and Wilke (1978) show an optimal oxygen tension of about 0.1 mm O2. To maintain a cell density higher than the natural maximum attained in the fermenter, methods for keeping the cells in the fermenter must be utilized. A high cell density can be maintained either by recycling cells (through membrane or centrifugal techniques) or by retaining or immobilizing the cells within the reactor. Immobilization would seem to be advantageous as the capital expense of a cell recovery and recycle system can be eliminated. There has been a good deal of work over the last 10-15 years on immobilizing organisms to maintain a high cell density in the bioreactor. Immobilization can take one of several approaches, 1) entrapment within a gel bead or plate, 2) adsorption onto a solid matrix, or 3) self-agglomeration or flocculation into flakes or pellets.

Increasing temperature generally speeds a fermentation until the temperature becomes high enough to cause cell death. Fermentation rates are generally noted to increase from 20° to 32° C., doubling with a 5° C. increase in temperature.

The traditional process of fermentation is carried out in a conventional batch operation utilizing yeast as the fermenting organism. To increase the efficiency a variation of the batch operation occasionally includes recycling of the yeast cells by systems such as sedimentation, centrifugation, or ultrafiltration. Normally this batch operation is conducted in two stages. The first stage involves propagation of the yeast and is referred to as the growth stage. The second stage involves the anaerobic process of ethanol production which is accompanied by a depletion of the oxygen. Further propagation of the yeast occurs during the anaerobic process of ethanol production.

Typically, a yeast inoculum is prepared in stage one. The requirements for maximum yeast reproduction are adequate amounts of carbon, nitrogen, minerals and oxygen, a pH in the range of 3.5 to 4.5, and a temperature in the range of 29°-35° C. Aerobic growth conditions define a system for more efficient production of yeast but under which no ethanol is produced. Stage two is the fermentation stage where the alcohol is actually produced by the yeast from the fermentable sugars. The yeast inoculum produced in stage one is used to seed a large fermenter containing glucose at appropriate pH, temperature and sugar concentration. Glucose was formed from the conversion of dextrins via saccharification enzymes. The dextrins were derived from molasses, corn starch materials, etc. via liquification enzymes. The inoculation rate can be 5 to 10 million cells per ml and during the fermentation the viable cell count can increase to 150-200 million cells per ml. Heat produced is controlled through the use of cooling coils. At these yeast levels, a final ethanol concentration of about 9 to 11% (v/v) can be obtained in 30 to 70 hours with batch fermentation. Increasing the yeast content, as is the case with cell recycle, can considerably reduce the time required for completion of the fermentation. For example, with a cell density of 800 to 1000 million cells per ml, it is possible to reduce the fermentation time to 4 to 10 hours.

Processes for the continuous fermentation of sugars to provide alcohol are also well known (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,155,134; 2,371,208; 2,967,107; 3,015,612; 3,078,166; 3,093,548; 3,177,005; 3,201,328; 3,207,605; 3,207,606; 3,219,319; 3,234,026; 3,413,124; 3,528,887; 3,575,813; 3,591,454; 3,705,841; 3,737,323; and 3,940,492 “Process Design and Economic Studies of Alternative Fermentation Methods for the Production of Ethanol”, Cysewski, et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. xx, pp. 1421-1444 (1978)). In a typical continuous fermentation process, a stream of sterile sugar liquor and a quantity of yeast cells are introduced into the first of a battery of fermentation vessels wherein initial fermentation takes place, generally under conditions favoring rapid cell growth. The partial fermentate admixed with yeast cells is continuously withdrawn from the first fermentation vessel wherein fermentation is carried out under conditions favoring the rapid conversion of sugar to ethanol. The yeast in the last fermentation vessel can be recovered by suitable means, e.g., centrifugation or settlement, and recycled. In such a system, the ability of the fermentation organism to produce ethanol is affected by the ethanol and sugar concentrations. As a rule, a yeast which gives high conversion rates of sugar to ethanol in a low-ethanol, high-sugar fermentation medium will only sluggishly produce ethanol under the opposite conditions, i.e., at high-ethanol level, low-sugar concentrations.

In general, however, the price of bioethanol has not been competitive with that of traditional fossil fuels and it is therefore highly needed to reduce production costs as far as possible by optimizing or improving upon bioethanol production technologies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an anaerobic fermentation process to enhance or improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time. A process is disclosed using a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions for the enhanced production of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar containing source. The process for producing ethanol by anaerobic fermentation comprises converting a carbohydrate or sugar source to ethanol using an ethanol producing microorganism in a fermentation broth, wherein said fermentation broth contains one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water, whereby said ethanol production is enhanced.

In another embodiment, a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions is used to increase or enhance ethanol production from the fermentation of an ethanol producing microorganism. A fermentation broth for the fermentation of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar source can comprise an ethanol producing microorganism, one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water.

The present invention provides a viable commercial method for ethanol production and can be used in, for example, fuel ethanol, industrial, cheese, brewing, and wine making industries.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition and its method of production, as well as its use as an animal litter. Particularly, the present invention relates to an absorbent composition that coats animal waste and provides an effective odor control.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owners had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. Housebroken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added liquid-absorbing materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The most commonly used litter box liquid-absorbing materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, and cellulose. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. The entire contents of the litter box including the soiled and unsoiled liquid-absorbing materials will eventually be removed because of the offensive odor caused by the absorbed urine and feces.

Most litters do not adequately control the odor associated with urine. The simple absorption of liquid, which litters typically provide, does little to counteract the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Currently clay soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, are used in an attempt to improve litter compositions. Sodium bentonites absorb liquid waste such as urine, and may also absorb some of the odor associated with the liquid waste, as the material binds amine compounds in the “face sites” of the clay interlayers. Plant-based litters, such as those made from wood chips or corn, can also absorb liquid waste, and be made disposable with the aid of clumping agents, but, again, litter box odor remains. This is because a significant contributor to “litter box smell” is the odor resulting from bacterial action on “aged” urine after three or so days in a litter box. In some cases, some of the urine can even collect and pool at the bottom of the litter box making an excellent breeding ground for bacteria. It is this bacteria from “old urine” in the litter box that most litters do not cover up well, and which is particularly troublesome to consumers.

Moreover, traditional plant-based or clay-based litters that are composed of sodium bentonites or other materials do not address the issue of fecal odor. Fecal odor differs from urine odor in that the odor is produced immediately at the time of defecation. Materials in fecal odor that carry an especially strong impact include butyric acid, p-cresol, skatole, and dimethyltrisulfide.

Furthermore, these traditional litter compositions are often formed from coarse granules, such that the granule's irregularity in both shape and size creates tracking by animals after usage, and dust formation that is associated with granule bumping.

There is also a concern of the rising cost of litter ingredients due to limited resources or unexpected high demands. For example, guar gum, a clumping agent, is also used in hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to adjust fracturing fluid viscosity. The recent popularity of fracking has driven up the cost of guar gum dramatically, forcing other industries to search for an alternative.

Various attempts to address the above issues are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,074,604 to Swank teaches an animal litter that includes a sorbent material that is composed of granule particulate, which is able to pass a −20 screen sieve. The sorbent material is combined with a binder such that greater than 90% of the granules have a size of between −5 and +60 screen sieve. The Swank granules also have an oil coating. The feedstocks operative in the Swank invention include corncob, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, attapulgite, montmorillonite, cellulosic plant stalks, husks and hulls, and combinations thereof.

US Patent Application Numbers 2009/000562 and 2012/0012064 to Jenkins et al. teach a waste encapsulating animal litter that encapsulates the solid and liquid animal waste within a shell that has a thickness of at least 1 mm, and wherein the litter comprises a water reactive polymer as a binder, an acidic solid material, and a carbonate-containing or percarbonate-containing solid material.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,771 to Goss teaches an animal litter made from clay materials and a combination of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, a clumping agent, and mineral oil, which acts as a dedusting agent.

The above references teach improvements of the traditional litters and disclose modifying base particle sizes and the use of additives such as binders and acids. However, these references only address one of many concerns and do not present a full solution to the challenges presented in finding a litter which will satisfy consumer needs. Further improvements must be implemented to effectively reduce tracking and odors, while yielding a litter which may be economically manufactured.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed toward a superior performance clay-based animal litter which comprises a clay-based liquid-absorbing material, and at least one filler that is coated with at least one clumping agent. The particle size of the liquid-absorbing materials is small enough to provide the litter with a “sandy” appearance. This superior litter is found surprisingly effective in coating animal waste, thereby dramatically reducing odors. This is accomplished by maximizing the litter's contact with the waste to intercept and block odor emanating from the surface. In addition, the small particle size reduces tracking and dusting. Moreover, it does not contain foaming agents and/or acids, nor does it require foams to encapsulate the waste in order to block odors.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to deodorizing compositions and methods of deodorizing animal litter. More specifically it relates to deodorizing compositions for animal litter, wherein the compositions are contacted with the litter by being sprayed onto the litter.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

Presently it is common for pet owners to train their house-broken animals to use absorbing compositions commonly known as litters to urinate and defecate. Pet owners later collect portions of the litter that are saturated with urine and remove feces of their animals. Animal litters usually contain clayey or other absorbent materials. It is beneficial if the litter contains clumping clay. Clumping clays swell after they absorb water-based liquids such as urine and form clumps that are easy to be removed by the pet owner. If a non-clumping clay is the main absorbing ingredient of the litter, then clumping agents or clumping enhancers may be added to the litter to ensure clump formation. The pet owner has to remove the feces and absorbent with the urine quite often in order to prevent emission of unpleasant odors into the surrounding area in their home or apartment. Furthermore, even when the pet owner frequently removes the fecal matter and clumps of absorbent material saturated with urine from the litter, it does not reduce or eliminate odors caused by the remaining uncollected small amounts of absorbent saturated with urine and difficult to collect small pieces of feces.

Animal litters often contain a deodorizing agent. A deodorizing agent that is mixed in with the absorbent material may not be dispersed uniformly in the bag or a box containing the litter or in the litter pan itself and may sink to the bottom. Additional means might be provided to improve the distribution of the deodorizing agent within the litter (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,291 to Lawson et al.). Various litter additives attempting to eliminate unpleasant odors of animal litter are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,005,520 to Michael describes a litter additive comprising a perborate and a desiccant, wherein when the waste material comes into contact with the peroxide or peroxygen compound, enough oxygen is produced to oxidize odoriferous compounds into non-odoriferous compounds. U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,456 to Lawson describes a litter additive that includes particles of sodium or potassium bicarbonate coated with mineral oil and agglomerated with expanded perlite. U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,547 to Yam discloses zinc ions solution sprayed onto sodium bicarbonate particles of sufficient size, so that they do not fully dissolve in the aqueous phase. The coated particles are then combined with appropriate absorbent materials of animal litter.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,279 to Ali et al. describes an aqueous deodorizing composition comprising an alkali metal tetraborate n-hydrate, a water-soluble/dispersible polymer and a volatile solvent. This composition while acting as urease inhibitor and having bacteriostatic properties creates a film when applied and dried to provide a matrix in which the boron additive, other materials, and animal waste are entrapped.

As the objectionable odors emanating from animal litter continue to remain a problem, an effort has been put into developing deodorizers for animal litters. The deodorizers available on the market can be added to the already purchased animal litter. For example, “Stink Free” brand litter and litter box spray powder deodorizer is a commercial deodorizer that is sprayed in the form of the liquid that later dries to create a solid physical barrier on the bottom of the litter box that prevents the odor contamination of the box and prevents litter from sticking to the box. When applied to the top of dirty litter, it forms a blanket that encapsulates and destroys the odors. A dense layer of powder accumulated on a litter might produce a crust and prevent proper absorption of urine by the absorbent material by allowing for the urine to remain on top of the crust, and therefore inhibit flow of the urine into the absorbent material.

Other available on the market cat litter deodorizers, including, for example, Tidy Cats®, Nil-O-Litter™, and Arm & Hammer® deodorizers, are usually provided in a powder form. They are meant to be added to and mixed with the clumping or non-clumping litter and additionally may be sprinkled on top of it.

These compositions and available products appear to pose several problems. Safety of the animals may be compromised because of the oxygen producing compounds. Additionally, there is the necessity to mix the powdered deodorizers with the litter and a possible lack of uniformity of the distribution of the additive within the litter. Further problems are created by a possibility of crust formation on the surface of the litter, when the deodorizing composition is applied in a liquid form and/or forms a film on the surface of the litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

There is provided an aqueous liquid deodorizing composition for animal litter, and a method of deodorizing animal litter by contacting the litter with the composition by spraying. The aqueous composition includes a crusting inhibitor in sufficient quantity to inhibit surface crusting of clumping clay litters but not enough to inhibit the normal clumping properties of the clay.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of treating surfaces to kill and/or prevent fungi and bacteria growth and protect from allergens by applying onto the surface a novel aqueous silane quaternary ammonium composition.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold can cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms. Molds can cause unwanted odors, produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or even asthma attacks in people allergic to mold. Other molds are known to produce potent toxins and/or irritants. Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth. Molds can also hasten the deterioration of surfaces and structural components of buildings.

Molds reproduce by making spores that usually cannot be seen without magnification. Mold spores waft through the indoor and outdoor air continually. When mold spores land on a damp area, the spores may begin growing and digesting whatever media such as spores are growing on in order to survive. Molds gradually destroy the area on which the spores grow.

Mold spores can be found in the air and on nearly every surface in a home, but generally a consistent source of moisture is required for mold to grow. Molds can grow on virtually any organic substance, as long as moisture and oxygen are present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, ceramic, concrete, plastics, textiles, and foods.

Many types of molds exist. Molds such as mold, fungus mold, and slime molds are most often found in areas that have high humidity levels such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms or damp basements (especially after flooding). Outdoor structures that are often wetted or remain damp are also areas of mold growth. Thus, roofs, fences, porches, pools and the like are often damaged by continual mold growth. Molds are a type of microscopic fungus that can grow naturally indoors and outdoors. The most common household mold types includeAspergillus, Cladosporium, PenicilliumandAlternaria. Stachybotrys chartarum, often referred to as black mold, is less common than the molds listed above and is the type of mold commonly dealt with in home remediations.

Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that are used to prevent microbiological contamination and deterioration of products, materials, and systems. Of the diverse categories of antimicrobial agents and compositions, quaternary ammonium compounds represent one of the largest of the classes of agents in use. At low concentrations, quaternary ammonium type antimicrobial agents are bacteriostatic, fungistatic, algistatic, sporostatic, and tuberculostatic. At medium concentrations they are bactericidal, fungicidal, algicidal, and viricidal against lipophilic viruses. Silicone containing quaternary ammonium compounds are well known as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,385, and the use of such compounds as antimicrobial agents is taught, for example, in a wide variety of patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701, and 3,817,739, where the compounds are used to inhibit algae; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,794,736 and 3,860,709 where they are employed for sterilizing or disinfecting a variety of surfaces and instruments; U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,728, where the compounds are used to treat aquarium filters; U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,103; and in British Patent No. 1,386,876. Published unexamined European Application No. 228464 of Jul. 15, 1987, teaches that microorganisms on plants can be killed by the application thereto of an aqueous mixture of a surfactant and an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a particular application of an antimicrobial silicone quaternary ammonium compound, a paper substrate is rendered resistant to the growth of microorganisms in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,366. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,541, an antimicrobial fabric is disclosed which is resistant to discoloration and yellowing by treatment of the fabric with a quaternary ammonium base containing an organosilicone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,937, as well as its companion U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,374, relate to wet wiper towelettes having an antimicrobial agent substantive to the fibers of the web and being an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a series of patents assigned to Burlington Industries, Inc. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,408,996, 4,414,268, 4,425,372, and 4,395,454, such compounds are disclosed to be useful in surgical drapes, dressings, and bandages. This same assignee also discloses these compounds as being employed in surgeons' gowns in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,928 and 4,467,013. Organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds have been employed in carpets in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,577; applied to walls, added to paints, and sprayed into shoes, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,378; applied to polyethylene surfaces and used in pillow ticking in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,511; in flexible polyurethane foams of fine-celled, soft, resilient articles of manufacture in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,297; and mixed with a nonionic surfactant in Japanese Kokai Application No. 60-048908, filed Aug. 26, 1983, of Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the purpose of achieving uniformity of distribution of compounds to a textile surface. Thus the versatility of such compositions is readily apparent.

For organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n is an integer from 0 to 2, hydrolysis of the first two X groups with water produces a species bearing —Si(OH)2— units which can self-condense through the hydroxyl moieties to linear and/or cyclic oligomers possessing the partial structure HO—Si—(O—Si)mm—O—Si—O—Si—O—Si—OH, where mm is an integer such that an oligomer is formed. For those cases, RSiX3, hydrolysis of the third X group generates a silanetriol (RSi(OH)3) which produces insoluble organosilicon polymers through linear and/or cyclic self-condensation of the Si(OH) units. This water induced self-condensation generally precludes storage of most organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n ranges from 0 to 2, inclusive, in water. Except for some organosilanes which can be stable in very dilute solutions at specific pH ranges, the use of water solutions of most organosilanes require the use of freshly prepared solutions. Quaternary ammonium organosilanes are often applied from solvent solutions such as lower alcohols and the commercial versions of these quaternized organosilanes are commonly provided as methanolic solutions.

Quaternary ammonium functional organosilanes containing hydrolyzable groups such as those sold under the trademark AEM® 5772 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride) by Aegis Environmental Co. of Midland, Mich. and REQUAT® 1977 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethyldi(decyl)ammonium chloride) by Sanitized, Inc. of New Preston, Conn. have found a large number of uses because of their ability to attach themselves to a wide variety of substrates where the quaternary ammonium functional group then acts as an antimicrobial and algicidal agent. Substrates treated with such quaternized organosilanes have also been noted to, among other things, be easier to clean, possess soil release properties, and cause hair to exhibit a conditioned appearance.

A clear microemulsion of a quaternized organosilane using a cosurfactant having an HLB value of at least 1 is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,766 to Blehm et al. This patent teaches that the methanol-based solvent in which the organosilane is supplied must be removed before blending the quaternized organosilane with the cosurfactant (e.g., a nonionic surfactant can used). If the methanol is not removed, a creamy white emulsion forms which is unstable and will separate into oil and water phases over time. The '766 patent also teaches that high shear may have to be applied to the mixtures of organosilane and cosurfactant to ensure codispersion.

Obviously, this has the disadvantage of requiring a homogenization step to prepare such microemulsions. Blehm et al. teach that almost any surfactant can be employed including anionic, cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as well as nonionic surfactants although nonionic surfactants and compounds such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and higher monoalcohols such as pentanol, decanol and decanediol are most preferred.

Another patent teaching oil-in-water emulsions containing 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride as well as, optionally, cosurfactants such as nonionic and cationic surfactants, is U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,273 to Blehm et al. These emulsions employ a homogenizer using high shear conditions and teach that the quaternized organosilane does not hydrolyze while it is in emulsion form and thus does not polymerize to an insoluble siloxane. The Examples use ARQUAD® T27W cationic surfactant which is trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride. However, these emulsions also require a water immiscible liquid such as a polydimethylsiloxane or a mineral oil with which the quaternized organosilane associates. Blehm et al. teach that a sufficient shear force is necessary to form the emulsions and that an Eppenbach mixer did not provide a sufficient amount of such shear.

Therefore, there exists a need for extended shelf life, water-stable organosilane compounds, such as silane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions thereof that, upon application, the active portion of the organosilane is operative for the selected application. Moreover, there exists a need for water-stable, organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions which are essentially non-toxic, non-flammable, uniformly dispersable, and simple and economical to manufacture and use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising an organosilane quaternary ammonium component, and an alkali bicarbonate component for treating a surface susceptible to fungi and bacteria growth, and to protect from the deposition of allergens on the surface. The aqueous composition of this invention is devoid of other polysiloxanes, has a long, stable shelf life, can be readily applied to any surface, and dries quickly once applied. The composition can be made by directly mixing the alcoholic solution of the organosilane quaternary compound to water without the need for removing the alcohol. Once in solution, the composition remains stable even if exposed to air until it is applied, and then dries quickly. The optional addition of surfactant allows the composition to be applied evenly across any surface. The alkali metal bicarbonate improves the antimicrobial properties of the composition and improves the drying time of the applied composition. The composition can be applied to a surface by any conventional coating method, such as by spraying, dipping wiping, roller coating and the like.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. No. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C.];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

The present invention is related to devices for testing ovarian reserve in pre- and peri-menopausal women.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many women do not realize that a significant decline in fertility begins in the early 30's. In fact, for many successful fertility treatments, the predominate predictor of pregnancy outcome is the age of the female partner. The significant impact that age has on fertility is related to both the quality and quantity of a woman's eggs.

Women are born with all the eggs that they will ever have. As such, the ovary can be generally thought of as an egg bank from which a woman withdraws during her reproductive life. Each month one egg or more is released during ovulation, but about one thousand additional eggs are lost by follicular atresia. Thus, with advanced maternal age the number of eggs that can be successfully recruited for a possible pregnancy declines.

In addition to this decrease in the number of eggs that women experience, some women may have poor quality eggs that reduce the likelihood that a given fertility treatment will result in a healthy pregnancy. Ovarian reserve screening is one mechanism by which fertility specialists can partially predict the reproductive potential of a specific patient as well as the potential of her eggs to result in a healthy pregnancy. Ovarian reserve is the term typically used to define the capacity of the ovary to provide eggs that are capable of fertilization. As such, the determination of a woman's ovarian reserve is an important aspect in the management and treatment of infertility.

Assessing ovarian reserve is routinely conducted for determining infertility in women of advanced reproductive age. One of the key indicators to determine the reproductive potential in women is the basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level on days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle. Elevated FSH at the early follicular phase is indicative of diminished ovarian reserve. Currently, the most common test for assessing ovarian reserve is the day 3 FSH test. This blood test determines the level of FSH on cycle day 3. Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature, as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. Generally FSH levels are expected to be below 10 mIU/ml in women with reproductive potential (e.g., levels of 10-15 mIU/ml are considered borderline).

While measuring serum FSH is still the standard practice and widely adopted in fertility clinics, such testing is not well suited for home use by an individual. As such, there remains a need for a reliable and more convenient and cost effective diagnostic test for home use, such as an over the counter test.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention satisfies at least some of the aforementioned needs by providing a diagnostic test kit that assesses ovarian reserve by assessing Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) in urine, preferably Day 3 first morning urine. Embodiments of the present invention comprise a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample deposited preferably on a sample absorbent in contact with a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device, such as a lateral flow platform. These embodiments can include a release medium formed of a first material, such as Ahlstrom 989, and a labeled conjugate comprising a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH. The release medium also can include a biotinylated capturable component having a second binding member reactive with a second epitope of FSH. In such embodiments, if FSH is present in the sample a complex is formed between the labeled conjugate, FSH, and the biotinylated capturable component. These embodiments also can include a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium. The capture medium is formed of a different material, such as nitrocellulose, than the release medium. The capture medium can include a test site having immobilized thereon a capture component. The capture component in these embodiments is capable of binding with the biotinylated capturable component.

Accordingly, a liquid sample applied to the release medium at a sample deposit location positioned upstream of both the labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component wicks downstream past the labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component (not necessarily in this order). If the sample includes any FSH, then a sandwich complex is formed between the labeled conjugate, FSH, and the biotinylated capturable component. As the liquid sample front travels from the release medium onto the capture medium, the complex is carried across the capture medium until it reaches the test site, which includes an immobilized binding member reactive with the biotinylated capturable component. When FSH is in the sample, the labeled complex (i.e., labeled conjugate-FSH-biotinylated capturable component) is bound and capable of being detected at the test site.

In other embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level. In certain embodiments, the predetermined amount or level of FSH can be referred to as a threshold amount of FSH. Particularly, the predetermined level can refer to FSH at a concentration that is deemed to be an elevated level. Preferred embodiments include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample and a first portion (e.g., a release medium) including a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH. The labeled conjugate is preferably present in excess relative to an amount of labeled conjugate necessary to bind the FSH present at the predetermined level. The device also includes a second portion including a test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH bound to the labeled conjugate and a reference site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising a binding member that binds a portion of the excess amount of the labeled conjugate. The device can also include a reservoir for containing liquid sample and excess labeled conjugate not captured at the test site and the reference site. In such embodiments, the color intensity of the reference site is calibrated to be inversely proportional to the concentration of FSH present in the sample. Assessment of the FSH level in the sample is based on the comparison of resulting color intensities at the test site and reference site.

In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH present in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level. The device can include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample, a first portion including a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH, and a second portion including a single test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH. In such embodiments, the device can be calibrated such that a signal (e.g., color development) indicating binding of FSH at the test site only occurs when FSH is present in the liquid sample at a concentration above the predetermined level and no signal at the test site indicates any FSH in the liquid sample is present at a concentration below the predetermined level.

In other embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample by utilizing a scavenger component. In such embodiments, the device includes a release medium formed of a first material and including a detectable label as well as a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium. The capture medium is preferably formed of a different material than that of the release medium. The capture medium includes a test site. However, these embodiments also include a scavenger component that is reactive with any of the following: (i) FSH, (ii) a FSH-labeled conjugate complex, (iii) a biotinylated capturable component-FSH-labeled conjugate complex, or (iv) combinations of (i) through (iii). The scavenger component can be located anywhere between the location of sample deposit and the test site.

In preferred embodiments, the scavenger component is provided in an amount to bind with a specific amount of FSH. As such, any amount of FSH above the predetermined level in the sample will be bound to the labeled conjugate and detected at the test site. That is, the specific amount of FSH can be substantially equal to the predetermined level of FSH. The specific amount of FSH to be bound by the scavenger component can be calibrated to correlate with a given concentration to reflect the predetermined level of FSH in the sample. That is, samples having an FSH concentration exceeding the predetermined level will bind with the labeled conjugate and be captured at the test site.

In another embodiment, a device according to the invention for detecting FSH present in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level can be designed to provide a single site or line for reading by a user to determine whether FSH levels are normal or elevated. Specifically, the single line can be a test site, and the device can be designed such that the formation of a signal at the test site indicates FSH values are elevated and the lack of formation at the test site indicates that FSH values are normal. In some embodiments, to indicate to the user that the device is functional (even though no signal is detected at the test site—meaning FSH values are normal), the device may include a control line wherein the presence of a signal is independent of normal or elevated FSH values and solely indicates that the device is functional.

Specifically, a device according to this embodiment of the invention may include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample; a first portion comprising a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH; and a second portion comprising a single test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH. Preferably, the device is calibrated such that a signal indicating binding of FSH at the test site only occurs when FSH is present in the liquid sample at a concentration above the predetermined level and no signal at the test site indicates any FSH in the liquid sample is present at a concentration below the predetermined level. Preferably, the single test site is the only site on the device visible to a user for indicating FSH concentration in the liquid sample.

In the above embodiments, calibration can comprise the use of a scavenger component, which can be located between the sample application member and the test site. Preferably, the scavenger component will bind any FSH present in the sample below the predetermined level. Of course, other means could be used for such calibration.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of determining ovarian reserve utilizing a test device according to embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment, a liquid sample is applied to a sample deposit location positioned upstream of a labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component located on the release medium. The liquid sample travels downstream from the sample deposit location and passes through a site including the labeled conjugate and a site including the biotinylated capturable component. The resulting complex is captured at the test site. The labeled conjugate is detected and signals the presence of FSH. Depending on the concentration of FSH in the sample, the resulting color intensity at the test site will vary.

In preferred embodiments, the capture medium of the test device also includes a reference site having immobilized thereon a binding member reactive with the labeled conjugate. Preferably, the reference site is “active” in the sense that the resulting color intensity changes based on the concentration of FSH in the sample. Specifically, the color intensity at the reference site can be inverse to the concentration of FSH present in the liquid sample. For instance, as FSH concentrations increase, more of the labeled conjugate is complexed with FSH and the biotinylated capturable component and captured at the test site. As a result, less labeled conjugate is available to flow past the test site and bound at the reference site. Accordingly, a woman's ovarian reserve can be determined based by a color comparison or “color matching” of the reference site and the test site. This also may be described as intensity matching or a comparison of the color intensity at the reference site versus the color intensity at the test site.

Preferably, the color intensity of the reference site is calibrated to correlate with the color intensity at the test site. For example, a predetermined level of FSH (e.g., lowest concentration deemed as being elevated) can be selected and an amount of labeled conjugate can be applied to the release medium so that if a sample contains the predetermined level of FSH then a portion of the labeled conjugate will bind the FSH and be captured at the test site while the remainder of the labeled conjugate will pass the test site and a portion will bind at the reference site, with any excess labeled conjugate flowing past the reference site. In such a case, color intensity at the test site and the reference site should be practically equal and signal that the sample contained the predetermined level of FSH. In the event that the sample has an FSH concentration above the predetermined level, the color intensity of the reference site will be lighter than the color intensity of the test site, thus indicating that the FSH concentration of the sample was elevated. If the color intensity of the reference site is darker than that of the test site, then the FSH concentration of the sample was normal.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a substantially anhydrous detergent composition that contains an effective amount of an insoluble stabilizer, such as clay, in a dispersed particulate form.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Liquid detergents are often considered to be more convenient to employ than dry powdered or particulate products. They are readily measurable, rapidly dissolved in the wash water, capable of being easily applied in concentrated solutions or dispersions to soiled areas on garments to be laundered and are non-dusting. Additionally, the liquid detergents may include materials that could not stand drying operations without deterioration, which materials are often desirably employed in the manufacture of particulate detergent products.

In particular, liquid detergent ingredients such as enzymes, bleach (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) and alkalizing agents contribute greatly to the removal of stains and soils. Multiple enzymes are typically used in detergent formulations to deliver a wide range of stain removal. These enzymes include, but are not limited to proteases (for stains/soils containing proteins such as dairy or grass), lipases (for stains/soils containing lipids such as butter or make-up), amylases (for stains/soils containing starches such as potatoes or gravy), and cellulases (for stains/soils containing cellulose such as fruits or vegetables). Meanwhile, bleaches work effectively against non-fatty stains such as red wine or coffee. Higher alkalinity can be provided by sodium carbonate or percarbonate, which helps to counteract water hardness and increase detergency.

However, most laundry detergents do not deliver all three mechanisms of stain removal due to incompatibility and interactions of the components that deliver these chemistries, particularly because current detergent systems are water based, which presents a challenge in stabilizing such a system. For example, enzymes that are typically only stable at a pH level of 6-9 can be unstable in a large presence of water. Bleaches, based on sodium percarbonates or hydrogen peroxide, are also unstable in aqueous environments at an alkaline pH level.

One of the approaches to deliver all of the cleaning ingredients together is to develop a pourable and substantially anhydrous paste or slurry system, which includes suspended percarbonate and/or carbonate salts and enzymes. The substantially anhydrous system is beneficial because the sodium percarbonate and enzymes would be stable in the absence of water, and they remain inactive until the system is in contact with a wash liquor. Furthermore, the incorporation of these salts in a stable anhydrous composition also provides an option to meter and package the composition in a dissolvable pouch or container. A dosed and contained detergent composition that requires minimal handling is highly desirable by consumers.

Various attempts are well known in the prior art to produce stable anhydrous detergents. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,466 to Carleton et al. teaches liquid laundry detergents that contain a chain structure type clay that is selected from attapulgite, sepiolite and palygorskite clays as a suspending agent.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,901 to Moorfield et al., which teaches a fabric care composition comprising an organophilic clay, a functionalized oil and water to provide softness benefits to fabric.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,992 to Fonsny teaches a non-aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising a suspension of builder salt in a liquid nonionic surfactant. The stability of the composition is improved by the addition of small amounts of organophilic-modified clay. The stability is further enhanced by reducing the solid particulate matter to a particle size below about 15 microns.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,316,812 to Hancock et al. teaches a liquid detergent composition comprising a dispersion of solids that includes one or more builders and bleach. The solids have an average particle diameter of less than 10 microns. Suitable inorganic builders include phosphates, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and, preferably, sodium tripolyphosphate, carbonates (e.g. sodium carbonate), sodium bicarbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate, clays (e.g. kaolin, montmorillonites and sodium bentonite), sodium borate, sodium citrate sodium meta-silicate and nitrilotriacetic acid.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,661,280 to Ouhadi et al. teaches a liquid heavy duty laundry detergent composition comprising a suspension of builder salt in a liquid nonionic surfactant, and at least one additional suspension stabilizing agent that is selected from the following: quaternary ammonium compounds, phosphoric esters, modified clays and mixtures thereof.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,713 to Dixit et al. teaches a non-aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising a builder salt suspension in a liquid nonionic surfactant. The composition is stabilized against phase separation by the addition of small amounts of low density fillers, such as hollow plastic or glass microspheres.

The above references teach various means to stabilize liquid detergent ingredients with the addition of fillers, builders and/or salts. However, there remains a need to formulate a stable liquid anhydrous detergent composition with a high proportion of dispersed solid materials.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A substantially anhydrous detergent composition is provided comprising a liquid phase, a dispersed solid phase and a processed clay mixture to stabilize the composition. The composition is surprisingly stable during its long-term storage, with no phase separation and minimal activated oxygen loss.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to liquid laundry detergents provided in the form of a water-soluble pouch containing the liquid laundry detergent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Laundry detergent compositions, contained within a water-soluble pouch, are seeing wider use among consumers for reasons of convenience. Consumers are attracted to such single dose products because such products are less likely to result in spillage or dripping. Further, the unit dose laundry detergent pouches are advantageous since the consumer does not come into direct contact with the ingredients of the composition. Pouches associated with these products are typically composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) or poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer films which can dissolve in water over a matter of seconds. The high aqueous solubility of such films necessitates a payload composition that contains a minimum amount of water. Typically, such compositions contain less than 10% water by weight.

It is generally believed that high water content liquid laundry detergents are incompatible with water-soluble films because of their water content. Thus, the attendant advantages of high water content liquid laundry detergents over other forms of laundry detergents such as granules, pastes, gels, and mulls have not been available in water-soluble unit dosage form. The advantages of liquid laundry detergents over granules, pastes, gels, and mulls include their aesthetic appearance and the faster delivery and dispersibility of the detergent ingredients to the laundry wash liquor, especially in a cool or cold water washing process.

The smaller amounts of water contained in water soluble pods have implications for both formulation and wash performance. For example, a smaller amount of water can limit the ability of certain materials to be incorporated into the composition, e.g. salts, water-soluble polymers (like anti-redeposition polymers), and water-soluble dyes. It is also well-known that removal of the chemical reactives in the payload are correlated with the extent of dissolution. As active ingredients in anhydrous formulations may not be released into the wash until full dissolution occurs, unit dose “pods” with higher water concentrations may exhibit faster action in the wash. Finally, as water is typically the least expensive component in a formulation, it is advantageous from a cost standpoint to employ the maximum amount of water, while still maintaining the desired performance.

There is a need, then, for unit dose systems with a level of water higher than that typically found in the prior art.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It has been found that by incorporating a polymer made from vinyl dicarboxylic acid monomers into a liquid laundry detergent composition, the composition can include at least about 30 wt. % water and be useful in a liquid-containing water-soluble unit dose pouch.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a device for applying epilation wax, allowing for a precise application from the standpoint of thickness as well as dimensions of the application.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Wax dispensers which are constituted of a head mounted on a flexible container are known. The container ensures the containment of the wax and the head ensures the distribution of the wax thus stored in the container.

The wax generally used is adapted to be made more fluid by a temperature increase. This fluidity is limited so as to enable an application of the wax in a thin layer, but without running, while also ensuring a sufficient wettability vis-à-vis the hairs and/or fine hairs to be removed. When cooling, the wax imprisons the hairs. The wax is adapted not to adhere to the skin. The wax thus deposited then only has to be removed by traction to ensure the hairs imprisoned within the wax are pulled out.

To facilitate this pulling operation, it is possible to lay a small strip of mesh or non-woven material on the laid out wax, immediately after application, when the latter is still sticky and has a “tacking” power, so the small strip is also imprisoned in the cooling wax matrix, becoming affixed to this small strip. A traction on the strip facilitates grasping and makes pulling out the wax/hairs assembly including the hairs possible.

Waxes are presently of a different nature, based on synthesis polymers. More and more, these new waxes are based on natural, sugar-based polymers. The advantages of these waxes are numerous. First, these waxes use sugars which are known to originate from agricultural products and are thus renewable. In addition, these products are naturally biodegradable, and require no recycling. The cleaning is carried out with water, and therefore without necessitating any sort of solvent and without generating any waste.

However, there still remains the problem of the wax application and practicality of this operation. This wax application and removal operation must indeed be simple, fast, precise, without requiring skill, and, most importantly, with no risk to the user. Another constraint is cleaning the device since the device must be reusable after a first use in a simple and fast manner without requiring complex cleaning or disassembly.

The device according to the invention not only targets the above objections, but, also targets other industrial objectives: simplicity of fabrication to limit costs, increased affordability of the device, a limited number of pieces to facilitate its assembly and its automation on a conveyor, and durable and reliable functioning, without blockages.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to multi-purposed dentifrice products.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries, i.e., tooth decay, is a leading cause of tooth damage in humans. Dental caries begins with lesions of so-called “white spots”, which are demineralized areas below the surface of intact dental enamel. Such subsurface lesions are formed before a cavity is detectable. If unchecked, surface enamel above a subsurface lesion eventually collapses, leading to cavitations and subsequent loss of tooth structure.

The primary component of the enamel and dentin in teeth is calcium phosphate in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite. This material is highly insoluble at normal oral pHs. However, calcium phosphate salts are more soluble in acidic media, and they are subjected to acids produced from the glycolysis of sugars by the action of various oral bacteria. Therefore, the acids cause carious lesions that form in teeth.

Although it is desirable to prevent caries from spreading, it is also desirable to restore the carious tooth to its original state. Restoration of a carious tooth to its original state involves the process of remineralization. The object of remineralization is to deposit hydroxyapatite in the carious lesion such that the dental enamel incorporates the hydroxyapatite into its structure at the point of lesion. Thus, remineralization not only prevents further tooth decay but also restores the tooth to its original state.

Saliva is supersaturated with respect to calcium and phosphate ions. Saliva therefore helps protect teeth against demineralization and can slowly remineralize teeth that have become demineralized by acids. It is also well known that the presence of fluoride ions can enhance the natural remineralization process and this is one of the accepted mechanisms by which fluoride toothpastes and rinses protect against caries. However, the modest levels of calcium and phosphate in saliva limit the efficacy of fluoride containing toothpastes and rinses to remineralize teeth. Therefore, it is highly desirable to increase the available concentration of calcium and phosphate ions in the oral cavity to speed up the remineralization process. To do so, one must taking into account of calcium phosphate's low solubility at the pH of saliva, and that calcium ions must be prevented from reacting with the phosphate ions or fluoride ions until immediately before use, so that the ions would not precipitate prematurely before reach oral cavity.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to attempt to cure the deminineralization problem. Examples are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,037,639; 5,268,167; 5,437,857; 5,427,768; and 5,460,803 (all to Tung), teach the use of amorphous calcium compounds such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride (ACPF) and amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate (ACCP) for use in remineralizing teeth. These amorphous compounds or solutions which form the amorphous compounds when applied either onto or into dental tissue prevent and/or repair dental weaknesses such as dental caries, exposed roots and dentin sensitivity. The compounds are claimed to have high solubilities, fast formation rates and fast conversion rates (to apatite). In the Tung patents, remineralization is accomplished by bringing the amorphous compound into contact with the dental tissue. This can be done directly, i.e., putting an amorphous compound directly on the tooth, or indirectly through a carrier, i.e., incorporating the amorphous compound in a carrier such as a gel, a chewing gum, or a toothpaste and applying the carrier to the dental tissue. Once contact is established with the tooth, the amorphous calcium phosphate compounds will recrystallize to the less soluble apatite form in the lesion and reform the tooth. However, under conditions where amorphous calcium phosphate compounds are stable, the quantity of calcium and phosphate released is relatively low and, therefore, remineralization is slower than desirable.

The aforementioned patents to Tung teach the use of two-part solutions wherein a first part contains phosphate salt(s) and a second part contains calcium salts(s), wherein either the first part or the second part further contains carbonate salt(s). In addition, the Tung patents teach solutions formed by dissolving in water a solid powder containing calcium salt(s). These solutions are salt(s) and carbonate salt(s). These solutions are then applied to dental tissue. The Tung patents further teach the use of non-carbonated solid powders containing mixtures of calcium salts and phosphate salts which can be applied directly to the tooth or dispersed in gel, chewing gum, or other non-aqueous medium such as toothpaste which is placed in contact with the tooth. The patents teach that these powders are easily dissolved in saliva and then reprecipitated as an amorphous calcium phosphate compound. However, the Tung patents do not disclose the pHs of aqueous solutions formed from the non-carbonated solid powders.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,502 to Winston et al. is directed to one-part, non-aqueous products and methods of using same to remineralize subsurface lesions, wherein the products contain at least one water-soluble calcium salt; at least one water-soluble phosphate salt; either a stabilizer or a hydrophilic, non-aqueous, water-soluble vehicle; and, optionally, at least one water-soluble fluoride salt. When the components are mixed with water or saliva to form an aqueous mixed solution, the solution has a pH of from about 4.5 to about 10.0.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,449 to Winston et al., is directed to two-parts, simultaneously releasable dentifrice. Such dentifrice compositions are capable of providing remineralization of subsurface lesions and/or mineralization of exposed dentinal tubules.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,321 to Lee et al. discloses a two-parts dentifrice that includes one part made of water soluble calcium phosphate salt having a pH less than 7, and a second part containing an alkaline material and a fluoride ion source to achieve a pH greater than 7.5. The two parts are stored separated and simultaneously released to generate hydroxyapatite depositing on dental enamel.

Besides dental caries, another major teeth problem facing the consumers is dental plaque build-up. Dental plaque is essentially a colorless biofilm that develops naturally on the teeth by colonizing bacteria attaching itself to a smooth surface (of a tooth). Dental plaque is soft enough to come off if scraped with a fingernail. However, If not removed, the plaque starts to harden and calcified within 48 hours, and in about 10 days the plaque becomes dental calculus (tartar), rock-hard and difficult to remove.

As the mature calculus develops, it becomes visibly white or yellowish in color unless stained or discolored by some extraneous agent. In addition to being unsightly and undesirable from an aesthetic standpoint, the mature calculus deposits can be constant sources of irritation of the gingival, causing gingivitis, which if left untreated, results in periodontitis. Generally periodontitis cannot be treated by superficial use of chemotherapeutic agents, and the intervention of a dentist is required and surgery is often necessary.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to attempt to remove or prevent plaque and/or tartar. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,024 to Winston et al. discloses dentifrices comprised of sodium bicarbonate, zinc oxide, and an anti-caries agent to inhibit the formation of plaque

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,310 to Lee et al. discloses a two-parts dentifrice that includes one part made of water soluble calcium phosphate salt having a pH less than 7, and a second part containing an alkaline material and a fluoride ion source to achieve a pH greater than 7.5. The two parts are stored separated and simultaneously released to generate a system for inhibiting tartar around the teeth.

While periodontitis, gingivitis, and tooth decay have longed vexed the human population, ill appearance of teeth due to stains are equally undesirable. Indeed, many individuals desire a “bright” smile and white teeth, and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material.

Stains on teeth can be of the extrinsic or intrinsic type. The types of attractive forces involved in extrinsic dental stains include electrostatic and van der Waal forces, hydration forces, hydrophobic interactions, dipole-dipole moment forces, and hydrogen bonds. The strength of adhesion for chromogens and pre-chromogens are not well understood. A method of classification was attempted to further describe dental stains which involves three categories (Nathoo SA. The chemistry and mechanisms of extrinsic and intrinsic discoloration.J Am Dent Assoc1997 April; 128 Suppl: 6S-10S).

In category 1 stains, the color of the discoloration is the same as the color of the material (chromogen) that causes the stain. The substances of tea, coffee and wine contain tannins and are composed of polyphenols such as catechins and leucoanthocyanins. These materials generate color due to the presence of conjugated double bonds and are thought to interact with the tooth surface via an ion exchange mechanism. Also included in the mechanism of adherence of the chromogen to the tooth is the salivary pellicle, a protein structure adhering to enamel via calcium bridges.

In category 2 stains, pigmented materials bind to the pellicle or tooth and subsequently change color. An example of this would be the cervical yellow stain turning brown with age. A proposed mechanism for this change is through the further accumulation or chemical modification of pellicle proteins (denaturation by acids or detergents). Intensification may occur via a metal bridging mechanism. Category 2 stains are considered to be more difficult to remove than category 1 stains.

In category 3 stains, the binding of a colorless material to teeth can undergo chemical reactions or transformations. The colorless material is termed a pre-chromogen. Examples of this type of staining are the induction of chlorhexidene stain, browning of foods high in carbohydrates and sugars via a rearrangement of the carbohydrates and amino acids, termed the Maillard or non-enzymatic browning reaction, and staining from stannous fluoride.

Thus, extrinsic stains result from chromogens binding either to enamel or probably more so to pellicle. The removal of a pellicle layer via a bleaching system will present a whiter tooth. The pellicle is a natural occurring biolayer and will re-establish itself if removed. It will do so with minimal chromogen build-up.

Intrinsic stains include phenomena occurring both before and after eruption of the tooth from the alveolar bone into the oral cavity. Pre-eruptive phenomena include endemic fluorosis, tetracycline staining, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and amelogenesis imperfecta. Post-eruptive phenomena include pulpal hemorrhaging, and deposition of secondary dentin or metals in a tooth from an amalgam restoration.

Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque.

The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.

There are a variety of compositions described in the art for preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The materials most commonly used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Such peroxides include hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, and sodium percarbonate.

When these peroxides are in appropriate contact with teeth they will usually oxidize the majority of stains, rendering the teeth whiter.

Current home whitening treatment methods include abrasive toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips.

The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, the type of bleaching agent, contact time of the bleaching agent on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the bleaching agent to penetrate the tooth enamel, and consumer compliance.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art for whitening teeth. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,211 to Winston discloses a hydrogen peroxide-releasing toothpaste comprising sodium bicarbonate and sodium percarbonate in a polyethylene glycol base for removing stains and odor.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,215 to Okay discloses a dentifrice composition for whitening and remineralizing teeth, wherein the three key components are a whitening agent, a protease enzyme, and a remineralizing agent.

Another example is U.S. Application Number 2007/0071696 to Wang et al. discloses a dual phase whitening oral care composition. The composition includes a first phase that contains a whitening agent in a substantially anhydrous and orally acceptable carrier and a second phase that contains an abrasive and an anti-calculus agent in an orally acceptable carrier. The first phase and the second phase are maintained separately from each other until dispensed.

Although consumers recognize the need to maintain healthy teeth, and have used various dentifrice products on the markets for this purpose, it must be noted that majority of the consumers preferred flavored dentifrices, in particular those that provide a “refreshing” taste upon usage. Refreshing flavors such as wintergreen are known to degrade in liquid (aqueous and non-aqueous) alkaline environments. For non-liquid formulation, wet granulations often supply sufficient water to initiate the degradation process even though the ultimate product (pressed tablet, mint, or candy) appears dry. Meanwhile, other components have sufficient trapped water within their crystal structure which can be released on compression and initiate the degradation. Still other components are hygroscopic to a sufficient degree such that moisture is picked up from the ambient environment in sufficient amounts to initiate the degradation process.

Furthermore, significant wintergreen degradation is observed when the bicarbonate dentifrices are flavored with wintergreen. Bicarbonate containing dentifrice formulations are often prepared with various standard humectants such as propylene glycol, glycerin, and polyethylene glycol. Where water is present, the degradation is more pronounced than when water is absent, but even in the absence of water, wintergreen degradation is still significant with these humectants.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to incorporate flavors in alkaline dentifrices. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,852 to Gopalkrishnan et al., disclosing a stable non-aqueous carrier for personal care product containing flavor and bicarbonates, comprising about 80-98% by weight of anon-ionic liquid triblock EO/PO/EO copolymer of MW=1000-5000, and about 2-20% by weight of a non-ionic solid triblock EO/PO/EO copolymer of MW=4000-16,000.

However, none of the above products or references disclosing whitening and/or reminerialization addresses the issue of removing plaque build-up. Moreover, none of the references disclosing remineralization or removal/prevent of plaque teaches whitening teeth. Furthermore, some of the mentioned references teach that of a two-parts dentifrice, and none address the issue of flavor degradation in alkaline dentifrice. Given the tedious task of teeth maintenance, there is a need for developing a flavored single-part and multi-purposed dentifrice, such that it requires only a single application to achieve the functions of teeth whitening, teeth remineralization, and prevention or removal of plaque.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A multi-purposed, single-part dentifrice comprising a remineralization component, a teeth whitening component, and a plaque inhibiting component.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for detecting luteinizing hormone (LH) in a biological sample.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Just prior to ovulation, women experience a short surge where the luteinizing hormone (LH) level rises to a significantly higher level relative to one's baseline, or normal circulating, LH level. As such, ovulation predictor tests are configured for the detection of this LH surge to facilitate the prediction of when a woman will ovulate. Generally, most women will ovulate within 24 to 36 hours after an LH surge is detected. A reliable method of predicting ovulation can determine a woman's fertility period for pregnancy. As such, ovulation predictor kits/devices must provide unambiguous test results (i.e., surge or no surge) to accurately facilitate the prediction of ovulation in a timely manner.

Ovulation predictor kits/devices currently available provide test results that can be difficult to interpret by a user due at least in part to the nature in which these test results are conveyed to the user. That is, ovulation predictor tests generally require the user to compare the resulting color intensities of the test line and reference line. In many instances, these devices are deemed to indicate LH surge when the test line exhibits a color intensity equal to or greater than the color intensity exhibited by the reference line. Accordingly, interpretation of these test results is necessarily subjective. For instance, as a user approaches the time of her LH surge the test results provided by these “color matching/comparing” devices become increasingly vague and subjective since the respective color intensities of the test and reference lines are increasingly similar. As such, the user is left to interpret as to whether the respective color intensities are truly indicative of an LH surge or not. This inherent guesswork can often result in the user missing the detection of her LH surge. The inability to timely identify an LH surge renders pinpointing ovulation undesirably difficult.

As such, there remains a need for a reliable ovulation predictor device that provides test results that can be less subjectively interpreted by a user, particularly by a user in her home.

"TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of toothbrushes, and more particularly, the invention relates to the field of electrically powered toothbrushes.

BACKGROUND

Toothbrushes have traditionally utilized one or more groups of bristles that are fixed or otherwise attached to the head or end of the toothbrush. Toothbrushes are also known to utilize movable bristle sets or bristle holders that are mechanically or electrically powered. Generally, a significant cleaning efficacy results from a toothbrush that utilizes a combination of fixed bristles and moveable bristles. Typically, for example, an electrical motor and drive mechanism are retained within the body of the toothbrush and are coupled to the movable bristle sets or bristle holders. Upon activation of the motor and drive mechanism, the bristle holders may undergo a variety of different types of motion. Further, typically for example one or more batteries are also provided within the body of the toothbrush to power the drive mechanism and impart motion to the bristle holder.

The mechanisms used to impart motion to the bristle holders often utilize complicated, expensive and in many instances precision gearing mechanisms to move the bristle holder with a desired motion.

What is needed therefore is an electric toothbrush with a combination of fixed bristles and movable bristles that provides motion to a movable bristle holder without complicated, expensive and precision gearing mechanisms.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of treating a solid surface to kill and/or prevent mold growth by applying onto the surface a novel aqueous silane quaternary ammonium composition.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold can cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms. Molds can produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or even asthma attacks in people allergic to mold. Other molds are known to produce potent toxins and/or irritants. Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth. Molds can also hasten the deterioration of surfaces and structural components of buildings.

Molds reproduce by making spores that usually cannot be seen without magnification. Mold spores waft through the indoor and outdoor air continually. When mold spores land on a damp area, the spores may begin growing and digesting whatever media such as spores are growing on in order to survive. Molds gradually destroy the area on which the spores grow.

Mold spores can be found in the air and on nearly every surface in a home, but generally a consistent source of moisture is required for mold to grow. Molds can grow on virtually any organic substance, as long as moisture and oxygen are present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, ceramic, concrete, plastics, textiles, and foods.

Many types of molds exist. Molds such as mold, fungus mold, and slime molds are most often found in areas that have high humidity levels such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms or damp basements (especially after flooding). Outdoor structures that are often wetted or remain damp are also areas of mold growth. Thus, roofs, fences, porches, pools and the like are often damaged by continual mold growth. Molds are a type of microscopic fungus that can grow naturally indoors and outdoors. The most common household mold types includeAspergillus, Cladosporium, PenicilliumandAlternaria. Stachybotrys chartarum, often referred to as black mold, is less common than the molds listed above and is the type of mold commonly dealt with in home remediations.

Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that are used to prevent microbiological contamination and deterioration of products, materials, and systems. Of the diverse categories of antimicrobial agents and compositions, quaternary ammonium compounds represent one of the largest of the classes of agents in use. At low concentrations, quaternary ammonium type antimicrobial agents are bacteriostatic, fungistatic, algistatic, sporostatic, and tuberculostatic. At medium concentrations they are bactericidal, fungicidal, algicidal, and viricidal against lipophilic viruses. Silicone containing quaternary ammonium compounds are well known as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,385, and the use of such compounds as antimicrobial agents is taught, for example, in a wide variety of patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701, and 3,817,739, where the compounds are used to inhibit algae; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,794,736 and 3,860,709 where they are employed for sterilizing or disinfecting a variety of surfaces and instruments; U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,728, where the compounds are used to treat aquarium filters; U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,103; and in British Patent No. 1,386,876. Published unexamined European Application No. 228464 of Jul. 15, 1987, teaches that microorganisms on plants can be killed by the application thereto of an aqueous mixture of a surfactant and an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a particular application of an antimicrobial silicone quaternary ammonium compound, a paper substrate is rendered resistant to the growth of microorganisms in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,366. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,541, an antimicrobial fabric is disclosed which is resistant to discoloration and yellowing by treatment of the fabric with a quaternary ammonium base containing an organosilicone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,937, as well as its companion U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,374, relate to wet wiper towelettes having an antimicrobial agent substantive to the fibers of the web and being an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a series of patents assigned to Burlington Industries, Inc. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,408,996, 4,414,268, 4,425,372, and 4,395,454, such compounds are disclosed to be useful in surgical drapes, dressings, and bandages. This same assignee also discloses these compounds as being employed in surgeons' gowns in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,928 and 4,467,013. Organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds have been employed in carpets in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,577; applied to walls, added to paints, and sprayed into shoes, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,378; applied to polyethylene surfaces and used in pillow ticking in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,511; in flexible polyurethane foams of fine-celled, soft, resilient articles of manufacture in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,297; and mixed with a nonionic surfactant in Japanese Kokai Application No. 60-048908, filed Aug. 26, 1983, of Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the purpose of achieving uniformity of distribution of compounds to a textile surface. Thus the versatility of such compositions is readily apparent.

For organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n is an integer from 0 to 2, hydrolysis of the first two X groups with water produces a species bearing —Si(OH)2— units which can self-condense through the hydroxyl moieties to linear and/or cyclic oligomers possessing the partial structure HO—Si—(O—Si)mm—O—Si—O—Si—O—Si—OH, where mm is an integer such that an oligomer is formed. For those cases, RSiX3, hydrolysis of the third X group generates a silanetriol (RSi(OH)3) which produces insoluble organosilicon polymers through linear and/or cyclic self-condensation of the Si(OH) units. This water induced self-condensation generally precludes storage of most organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n ranges from 0 to 2, inclusive, in water. Except for some organosilanes which can be stable in very dilute solutions at specific pH ranges, the use of water solutions of most organosilanes require the use of freshly prepared solutions. Quaternary ammonium organosilanes are often applied from solvent solutions such as lower alcohols and the commercial versions of these quaternized organosilanes are commonly provided as methanolic solutions.

Quaternary ammonium functional organosilanes containing hydrolyzable groups such as those sold under the trademark DOW CORNING® 5772 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride) by Dow Corning Corporation of Midland, Mich. and REQUAT® 1977 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethyldi(decyl)ammonium chloride) by Sanitized, Inc. of New Preston, Conn. have found a large number of uses because of their ability to attach themselves to a wide variety of substrates where the quaternary ammonium functional group then acts as an antimicrobial and algicidal agent. Substrates treated with such quaternized organosilanes have also been noted to, among other things, be easier to clean, possess soil release properties, and cause hair to exhibit a conditioned appearance.

A clear microemulsion of a quaternized organosilane using a cosurfactant having an HLB value of at least 1 is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,766 to Blehm et al. This patent teaches that the methanol-based solvent in which the organosilane is supplied must be removed before blending the quaternized organosilane with the cosurfactant (e.g., a nonionic surfactant can used). If the methanol is not removed, a creamy white emulsion forms which is unstable and will separate into oil and water phases over time. The '766 patent also teaches that high shear may have to be applied to the mixtures of organosilane and cosurfactant to ensure codispersion.

Obviously, this has the disadvantage of requiring a homogenization step to prepare such microemulsions. Blehm et al. teach that almost any surfactant can be employed including anionic, cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as well as nonionic surfactants although nonionic surfactants and compounds such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and higher monoalcohols such as pentanol, decanol and decanediol are most preferred.

Another patent teaching oil-in-water emulsions containing 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride as well as, optionally, cosurfactants such as nonionic and cationic surfactants, is U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,273 to Blehm et al. These emulsions employ a homogenizer using high shear conditions and teach that the quaternized organosilane does not hydrolyze while it is in emulsion form and thus does not polymerize to an insoluble siloxane. The Examples use ARQUAD® T27W cationic surfactant which is trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride. However, these emulsions also require a water immiscible liquid such as a polydimethylsiloxane or a mineral oil with which the quaternized organosilane associates. Blehm et al. teach that a sufficient shear force is necessary to form the emulsions and that an Eppenbach mixer did not provide a sufficient amount of such shear.

Therefore, there exists a need for extended shelf life, water-stable organosilane compounds, such as silane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions thereof that, upon application, the active portion of the organosilane is operative for the selected application. Moreover, there exists a need for water-stable, organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions which are essentially non-toxic, non-flammable, uniformly dispersable, and simple and economical to manufacture and use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising an organosilane quaternary ammonium component, a nonionic surfactant component, and, optionally, an alkali bicarbonate component for treating a surface susceptible to mold to prevent mold formation. The aqueous composition of this invention is devoid of other polysiloxanes, has a long, stable shelf life, can be readily applied to any surface, and dries quickly once applied. The composition can be made by directly mixing the alcoholic solution of the organosilane quaternary compound to water without the need for removing the alcohol. Once in solution, the composition remains stable even if exposed to air until it is applied, and then dries quickly. The addition of surfactant allows the composition to be applied evenly across any surface. The alkali metal bicarbonate improves the antimicrobial properties of the composition and improves the drying time of the applied composition. The composition can be applied to a surface by any conventional coating method, such as by spraying, wiping, roller coating and the like.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to devices and methods for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as an indicator of pregnancy. More particularly, the devices can provide improved analytical and clinical sensitivity by detecting all clinically relevant hCG isoforms.

BACKGROUND

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone produced during pregnancy. The hCG hormone is produced by the developing embryo soon after fertilization and later by syncytiotrophoblast cells in the developing placenta, and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy. The hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that also includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit of hCG is unique, although there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits within the GPH family. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity.

Intact hCG, which is also known as regular hCG, has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa and is composed of 244 amino acids. The alpha subunit contains 92 amino acids and the beta subunit contains 145 amino acids. Intact hCG is generally present at varying levels throughout pregnancy, has been noted to be the predominant form of hCG in later stages of pregnancy, and has previously been believed to have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy. Multiple variants of hCG that exhibit independent functions are currently recognized and one of these is hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) which is predominantly produced in early pregnancy. A variety of dissociation and degradation products of hCG are found in blood and urine and these include, among others, nicked hyperglycosylated hCG, nicked hCG, free hCG beta subunit (hCG-β), nicked free hCG beta subunit, nicked hyperglycosylated hCG free beta subunit, and hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf). See de Medeiros et al.,Human Reproduction Update15(1): 69-95 (2009) and Birken et al.,Endocrinology123: 572-583 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference.

In early pregnancy urine, the levels of hCG and its dissociation and degradation products, collectively referred to as hCG isoforms or variants, vary greatly from day to day and from subject to subject. Most pregnancy tests have been developed to preferentially detect intact hCG or to detect some combination of hCG, hCG-H, and hCG-β.

One distinct degradation product of hCG is the hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf), which is a fragment of hCG-β, has a molecular weight of about 14 kDa, and contains 73 amino acids in its protein core. The hCG-βcf isoform is now recognized to be a predominant form of hCG present in urine from about seven weeks of pregnancy. See de Medeiros et al.,Obstet. Gynecol,80(2): 223-230 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference. It has been noted that high levels of hCG-βcf can cause false negative results in urine-based pregnancy tests. For more information, see Diwan,Med. Lab. Observerpg. 18-20 (February 2011); Cervinski et al.,Clin. Chem. Lab. Med.48(7): 935-942 (2010); Gronowski et al.,Clin. Chem.55(7): 1389-1394 (2009), which are incorporated herein by reference. Previous and current pregnancy tests, however, do not detect this isoform or have only limited detection capability for this isoform in urine samples.

Accurate and rapid detection of low levels of various hCG isoforms is desirable to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred. Further, it is desirable to minimize incidences of false negative results. Accordingly, it would be beneficial to develop a pregnancy test to detect multiple relevant forms of hCG (e.g., all clinically relevant forms of hCG) to increase the reliability and accuracy of pregnancy detection, particularly in early pregnancy.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides systems and methods for identifying the presence in liquid samples of pregnancy indicators, and can be particularly useful for pregnancy detection. In particular, the invention provides systems and methods that allow for the detection of all clinically relevant isoforms of hCG that may be present in a liquid sample. For example, the invention may provide devices that are capable of detecting hCG-βcf in addition to one or more other hCG isoforms. Such systems and methods may provide enhanced sensitivity (e.g., increased provision of positive results early in pregnancy when levels of hCG present in the urine of a subject are low and often previously inconclusive). Such systems and methods may provide enhanced clinical sensitivity (e.g., a lower likelihood of false negative pregnancy test results), which can be evidenced by enhanced analytical sensitivity.

In certain aspects, the invention provides a device for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a substrate comprising: i) a first antibody that recognizes all clinically relevant hCG isoforms; ii) a second antibody that is specific for an epitope unique to the hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf) isoform or that is specific for an epitope common to both hCG-βcf and hCG beta subunit (hCG-β); and iii) a third antibody that binds multiple hCG isoforms but not the hCG-βcf isoform. In specific embodiments, one of the following conditions can be met: a) the first antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label; or b) both of the second antibody and the third antibody can be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. In certain embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium formed of a second, different material.

In some embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the second and third antibodies are immobilized at one or more capture sites located on the capture medium. The second and third antibodies, for example, can be mixed, and the mixture of antibodies can be immobilized at the capture site. In such embodiments, the first antibody can be deposited on the release medium. The first antibody can, in certain embodiments, be conjugated with a detectable label.

In some embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the first antibody is immobilized at a capture site located on the capture medium. In such embodiments, the second and third antibodies can be, for example, deposited on the release medium. The second and third antibodies can be deposited on separate regions of the release medium or can be mixed, and the mixture of antibodies can be deposited on the release medium. In certain embodiments, the second and third antibodies may be conjugated with one or more detectable labels.

In certain embodiments, a device is provided wherein the capture medium includes a capture component immobilized at a capture site, the capture component comprising avidin or an equivalent thereof. In such devices, the first antibody, second antibody, and third antibody may be deposited on the release medium. For example, the first antibody, the second antibody, and third antibody can be deposited on separate regions on the release medium or in some embodiments, the first antibody is deposited on a first region on the release medium, and the second and third antibodies are mixed and the mixture of antibodies is deposited on a second, separate region on the release medium. In devices utilizing a capture component comprising avidin, one or more of the antibodies preferably can be conjugated with biotin (i.e., biotinylated). Further, one or more of the antibodies preferably can be conjugated with a detectable label.

For example, in some embodiments, the second and third antibodies are both biotinylated. In such embodiments, the first antibody may optionally be conjugated with a detectable label. In other embodiments, the first antibody is biotinylated and both of the second and third antibodies may optionally be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. The form of the avidin can vary; for example, the avidin can comprise monomeric or polymeric avidin. In certain embodiments, the avidin can comprise streptavidin.

In certain embodiments, one, two, or three of the first antibody, the second antibody, and the third antibody are monoclonal antibodies. In preferred embodiments, all of the first, second, and third antibodies are monoclonal antibodies. The detectable label or labels, where present, can vary. In some embodiments, the detectable label comprises a colored particle. For example, in certain embodiments, the colored particle is a colloidal gold particle (i.e., a gold sol). The first, second, and third antibodies and their specificities for certain hCG isoforms can vary. For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, the second antibody is specific for an epitope unique to hCG-βcf or specific to an epitope that is common to both hCG-βcf and hCG-β.

In another aspect of the present invention is provided a method for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises applying a liquid sample to a device for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample. The device can be a device as described above, which comprises a substrate comprising: i) a first antibody that recognizes all clinically relevant hCG isoforms; ii) a second antibody that is specific for an epitope unique to hCG-βcf or that is specific for an epitope common to both hCG-βcf and hCG-β; and iii) a third antibody that binds multiple hCG isoforms but not the hCG-βcf isoform. As above, the first antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label, or both of the second antibody and the third antibody can be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. Applying the liquid sample is generally done such that any hCG isoform in the liquid sample flows with the liquid across the substrate so as to contact the antibodies so as to form a sandwich complex comprising relevant hCG isoforms. After applying the liquid sample, the method may further comprise determining the presence of one or more of the hCG isoforms in the liquid sample by inspection of a capture site on the substrate, wherein the presence of the hCG isoforms is indicated by the presence of a detectable signal (e.g., at the capture site) caused by the presence of the sandwich complexes at the capture site. For example, the detectable signal can comprise color development (or other visually identifiable means) such as may provide a visual signal. Further, the detectable signal may be a signal that is electronically analyzed so as to provide a digital output, giving the user the results in a digital form.

In a further aspect of the present invention is provided a method for increasing clinical sensitivity by detecting the presence of multiple pregnancy indicators in a liquid sample. For example, such method can comprise applying a liquid sample to a device as described above, such that various hCG isoforms in the liquid sample flow with the liquid across the substrate so as to contact the antibodies and form sandwich complexes comprising relevant hCG isoforms. The method further can comprise determining the presence of one or more of the hCG isoforms in the liquid sample by inspection of a capture site on the substrate, wherein the presence of the hCG is indicated by a detectable signal resulting from the presence of the sandwich complexes at the capture site. The device beneficially can provide enhanced clinical sensitivity for detecting a pregnancy as compared to devices that do not include the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform. The clinical sensitivity for detecting a pregnancy can vary, and in certain embodiments, the clinical sensitivity can be significantly better than the clinical sensitivity of devices that do not include the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform. In certain embodiments, the clinical sensitivity of the device incorporating the antibody specific for hCG-βcf can exceed the clinical sensitivity of a similar device that does not include the antibody that is specific for hCG-βcf when measured 6 days, 5 days, or 4 days before the expected menstrual period. For example, the clinical sensitivity of the device may be about 5% or greater, about 10% or greater, or about 15% or greater on these days. In certain embodiments, the device may be about 5% or greater on days 6, 5, and 4 before the expected menstrual period when compared to similar device without the antibody for hCG-βcf isoform. For example, in one specific embodiment, the clinical sensitivity of the device incorporating the antibody specific for hCG-fβcf is around 14%, around 20%, and around 10% greater on days 6, 5 and 4, respectively, before the expected menstrual period when compared to similar device without the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition and its method of production and use. Particularly, the present invention relates to an absorbent composition comprising a liquid absorbing material, at least one alkaline earth metal peroxide and an acidic material, wherein the composition is found surprisingly effective in mitigating fecal odor.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owners had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. Housebroken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added liquid absorbing materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The most commonly used litter box liquid absorbing materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, and cellulose. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. The entire contents of the litter box including the soiled and unsoiled liquid absorbing materials will eventually be removed, because of the offensive odor caused by the absorbed urine and feces.

Many litters adequately control the odor associated with urine. This is typically done through simple absorption of liquid, which counteracts the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Currently clay soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, are used to improve litter compositions. Sodium bentonites not only absorb liquid waste such as urine, but they also absorb the odor associated with the liquid waste, as the material binds amine compounds in the ‘face sites” of the clay interlayers.

However, clay litters composed of sodium bentonites or other materials do not address the issue of fecal odor. Fecal odor differs from urine odor in that the odor is produced immediately at the time of the defecation, whereas urine odor, being produced by the action of microbes, evolves in the days following urination. Materials in fecal odor that carry an especially strong impact include butyric acid, p-cresol, skatole, and dimethyltrisulfide.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art for preparing animal litter to combat offensive odor. One such example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,354 to Thomas II, et al., describing a method for controlling ammonia odor from organic waste by monobasic salts of dibasic acids, and mono-, di- or tri-basic acids, such that the acid has a dissociation constant pKaless than the corresponding dissociation constant of aqueous ammonia.

Another example is WO2000/53001 to Simmler-Hübenthal et al., disclosing an animal litter containing thyme camphor and/or at least one solid peroxo compound to reduce smells.

Another example is U.S. Application No. 2006/0088498 to Martin et al., describing a solvent activated antimicrobial oxidizing agent comprising a reactor such as magnesium peroxide and/or calcium peroxide within a reactor core for treating animal litter, and that such oxidizing agent may be used to eliminate odor related to microbes on ice in ice machines. However the composition of Martin et al. requires a reactor wall such as a porous membrane to control the release of solvent to the reactants and the diffusion of the oxidizing agent.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other, materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. No. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose, methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to animal litters, and in particular to animal litters that have been chemically modified, wherein the litter is found surprisingly effective in mitigating urine and fecal odors.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In an effort to efficiently and effectively collect animal urine and/or feces, various methods and compositions are known to utilize absorbent materials in litter boxes and animal cages. In particular, clays (primarily bentonite) have been used as a base material for absorbent animal litters for some time. These materials become tacky when wetted, thereby forming a “clump” that is easily removed from a litter box. Many animals, especially felines, will often refuse to use a litter box that is not kept scrupulously clean. Clumpable animal litters facilitate the ease of cleaning, because otherwise the litter box has to be periodically dumped and refilled to maintain appropriate cleanliness.

Clays such as those based on the clay minerals kaolinite, illite, attapulgite, montmorillonite, sepiolite, diatomite, and the like, have been used extensively in animal litter compositions due to their water and moisture absorbing properties. However these materials have very little, if any, deodorizing properties.

Numerous attempts in prior art to modify liquid absorbing material (i.e. clays) within the litter to optimize its odor-inhibiting property are well known. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 2,895,873 to Sawyer et al., which teaches clay materials that are treated with sulfuric acid to form in-situ certain acidic salts. The treated clays neutralize basic odors that are originated from animal waste or decomposition.

Another example is PCT Application No. WO 0053001 to Simmler-Hübenthal et al., which teaches a litter that contains clays such as bentonite and a solid peroxo compound such as magnesium or calcium peroxide.

Another example is European Patent No. EP 1240821 to Haimerl et al., which teaches an animal litter that includes peroxo compound and calcium bentonite that is treated with hops extract to achieve a beta-acid content of 900 ppm.

In yet another example, U.S. Patent No. 2006/0088498 to Martin et al. teaches an animal litter that contains a solvent-activated reactor. The reactor is formed from a core that contains reactants such as calcium and magnesium peroxide.

Although the above-mentioned litters reduce odors to some degree, it is still desirable to further optimize liquid absorbing materials to achieve drastic reduction of malodors, and to simultaneously provide an economical method to produce such litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed toward a modified animal litter comprising at least one acid-activated liquid absorbing material in combination with at least one peroxide, wherein the litter provides a surprisingly steady and consistent suppression of malodors that are generated from animal waste.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention concerns a depilatory (epilatory) polymeric composition with controlled temperature setting of use. The novel depilatory/epilatory polymeric composition is directly applicable to the skin with removal by peeling, preferentially without an additional support strip.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A well known principle permits enclosure of hair in a polymeric matrix in the form of a strip and the manual removal of the strip by peeling to ensure hair extraction. For reasons of depilatory effectiveness, non aqueous polymeric compositions are generally preferred. Nevertheless, the requirements these depilatory polymeric compositions must meet are numerous and, for some, difficult to reconcile.

One requirement is to be able to bring and maintain the depilatory polymeric composition during the depilation process to a temperature adapted to provide the desired temperature in a fast and practical way.

Another important factor is the time for depilation duration, which time needs to be reduced because the depilation practice is tedious, and professionals as well as consumers wish to dedicate the least possible time to it.

Also, not only should the heating time be reduced, but the duration for which the polymeric depilatory composition remains usable during the depilation process should be the longest possible. Such duration of use is the interval during which the depilatory polymeric composition remains at a temperature acceptable for the skin, that is compatible with its homogeneous, easy and painless application, in a thin layer with a spatula or any appropriated applicator in order to be able to enclose the hair to be pulled. Currently, the duration of use, according to the here above-defined meaning, is in the order of 10 minutes for a 400 g pot of composition formulated according to the prior art.

Aesthetic criteria are important in that they can contribute to regular epilation practices; in addition, the epilatory polymeric compositions should also help to improve the overall experience of epilation by being able to adhere to short hair, therefore improving the epilation quality. The adherence of the composition to the hair has been incorporated into the formulation so as to obtain a very satisfactory and immediate high quality epilation, leaving only minimally visible, less numerous and shorter hair. Such improvement of the adherence also offers the possibility to proceed with a new epilation on short hair without having to wait for hair to regrow to a significant and unsightly length.

A depilatory polymeric composition must also meet other important requirements, regarding its rheology. Indeed, it is necessary to apply the depilatory polymeric composition in a thin layer, at a temperature acceptable for sensitive areas of the skin, without provoking the formation of threads susceptible to disrupt handling. Once the wax is frozen on the skin and the hair enclosed, it is essential that the strip produced be removed by hand, by peeling, in a single, fast movement. This entails that the laid strip should keep a certain deformability, suppleness and flexibility. On the other hand, these parameters must remain within values that do not affect negatively the cohesion of said strip and avoid stretching, making the removal of the strip difficult and risking the formation of composition deposits or residues adhering to the skin, which residues are always difficult and unpleasant to eliminate from the skin. In particular, for compositions forming strips on the skin, the composition rheology should be adapted to permit strip removal when the composition reaches a temperature at which the strip surface no longer adheres to the finger, i.e. a temperature at which the strip adheres minimally to the skin while keeping the required abilities for adhering to the hair.

Considering the intended use of the product, the depilatory polymeric composition may include at least dyes and/or perfumes for the sake of aesthetics. It is also possible to include solid particles or fibers, or ingredients intended notably to modify the presentation or aspect.

The prior art proposed depilatory waxes as described in French patent No. 2 751 872. However, such waxes only very partially met the requirements recited above, not permitting namely a homogeneous heating by a microwave heating oven.

Another European patent EP No. 299 816 proposed a rosin and elastomer-based depilatory composition of a disposable type. That patent, although not providing sufficient information, is characterized by the combination of an elastomeric or thermoplastic macromolecular compound, rosin and a plasticizer.

This invention proposes a depilatory polymeric composition that meets the numerous requirements described above, that is industrially feasible, comfortable to apply, and easy to use by consumers.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to powdered absorbing compositions containing clay. More particularly it relates to absorbing compositions that can be used as animal litter such as cat litter. More specifically it relates to absorbing compositions such as cat litter, containing de-dusting and deodorizing agents and a method of forming same.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

Nowadays it is common that pet owners train their animals such as cats into a habit of urinating and defecating into a special litter pan containing powdered absorbent materials commonly known as litter. The pet owner later collects urine-saturated portions of the litter and feces. Similarly, caged animals such as guinea pigs use absorbent litter in their cages. The absorbent materials for this purpose often include discrete clay and filler particles. These small sized particles create dust. Dusting is one of the major negative attributes of handling powdered materials. The airborne dust usually consists of particles smaller than 25 microns and represents a minor portion of the litter, which is about equal or less than 1%. The major problem with handling cat litter occurs when it is being transferred from a box or a bag into the cat litter pan. The particles of powdered materials create airborne dust that is particularly noticeable and unpleasant to a person transferring the litter. Additionally, small particles become airborne when the animal attempts to cover the area of the litter that it used most recently and they are easily tracked out of the litter pan on the animal's paws ending up on the floor or the carpet or even a couch.

Clay and other particulates are common materials used in various animal litters (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,208 to Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,989 to Rosenfeld, U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,961 to Goss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,118 B1 to Huber et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,291 to Lawson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,129 to Lawson). No matter what the constituents of the compositions are, there remains the nuisance of the airborne dust.

Consequently, there is a need for an absorbing composition that would address the problem of dust associated with materials such as an animal litter. Such a composition would not be prone to dusting when handled and would include an inexpensive de-dusting agent that would be safe and non-irritating to the animal.

A composition comprising sodium bentonite, a mixture of limestone and dolomite or calcite and a de-dusting agent of guar gum has previously been produced by adding an aqueous solution of the guar gum to the limestone and dolomite mixture by spraying the guar gum solution onto the falling curtain of limestone and dolomite from a belt scale to a transfer screw conveyer. The transfer screw conveyer mixes the guar gum solution with the filler particles. The guar gum treated filler was then combined with the remaining ingredients, in particular, the sodium bentonite, to form the composition. Alternatively, powdered de-dusting agents were distributed on a moving bed of fillers, and water sprayed on the fillers/de-dusting agent mixture, so as to stick the de-dusting agent onto the filler. This method provides more de-dusting agent into the product. The addition of sodium bicarbonate particles to the composition, improves odor control of the animal litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The object of the invention is to provide an absorbent composition that includes a powdery material, which produces less airborne dust when handled, and has added odor control.

There is provided an absorbent composition for water-based liquids, wherein dusting normally associated with handling of powdered absorbent materials is significantly reduced. The composition can be an animal litter, such as cat litter. The composition comprises a water-absorbing material, a filler, a de-dusting agent, and an odor control agent.

A method of preparing the composition is also provided which allows for sufficient de-dusting agents to be readily included in the composition, and a composition having improved odor control.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to peroxide-containing compositions, and more particularly to peroxide-containing cleaning compositions exhibiting enhanced peroxide stability.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide have a bleaching effect on organic substances and are therefore used in, for example, detergents, cleaning compositions, disinfectants, deodorizers and hair coloring products. Peroxide-based solutions are well-known for their oxidative and antimicrobial properties, and have been used in washing and cleaning processes. Generally, to clean a substrate such as clothing, the substrate is subjected to hydrogen peroxide or a substance capable of generating perhydroxyl ions (HOO−), such as inorganic or organic peroxides. Upon contact with the surface of the soiled substrate, the peroxide effectively removes common stains such as coffee or wine, while disinfecting the cleaned surface.

To be effective, peroxide-containing solutions must contain a sufficient amount of peroxide to both clean and disinfect. Accordingly, it is desirable to add ingredients and employ conditions which maximize the activity of peroxides. However, peroxide compounds are very labile. The amount of peroxide in cleaning compositions typically decreases as a function of time under normal storage conditions. Ingredients and conditions which favor maximizing the activity of peroxides, likewise, reduce the stability of peroxides under storage conditions. This creates a problem with efficacy.

Accordingly, it would be useful to formulate a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting enhanced peroxides while improving the stability of the peroxides under storage conditions. There is a need for a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting both enhanced activity and improved peroxide stability.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting improved peroxide stability with extended shelf-life. The peroxide-containing cleaning composition of the present invention is specifically formulated for enhanced cleaning (bleaching) activity, while substantially improving peroxide stability. The peroxide-containing cleaning composition of the present invention can be used in a range of cleaning products including, but not limited to, laundry detergents, carpet/rug cleaners, glass cleaning products, dish washing compositions, hard surface cleaners, and scouring agents. The present peroxide-containing cleaning composition includes a peroxide-containing bleaching agent for supplying reactive oxygen species in amounts sufficient to perform cleaning (bleaching), at least one surfactant for enhancing detersive and cleaning action, an alkali metal salt in amounts sufficient to maintain an alkaline pH of the composition where an alkaline pH is known to enhance peroxide activity, and an aqueous diluent. Of particular importance to the present invention is the addition of a silane quaternary ammonium compound which interacts with the components of the composition to improve peroxide stability. As used herein, the term “peroxide-containing bleaching agent” means an agent that contains and/or liberates the peroxide ion.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a cleaning composition, which comprises:

a peroxide-containing bleaching agent;

at least one surfactant;

an alkali metal salt in amounts sufficient to maintain an alkaline pH of the composition;

a silane quaternary ammonium compound present in an amount sufficient to enhance the stability of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent; and

an aqueous diluent.

In another aspect of the present invention, the mole ratio between the silane quaternary ammonium compound and the surfactant, especially an anionic surfactant, controls the stability of the peroxide.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of stabilizing a peroxide-containing cleaning composition containing a peroxide-containing bleaching agent especially at an alkaline pH, which comprises adding at least one surfactant and a silane quaternary ammonium compound in amounts sufficient to enhance the stability of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent.

"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that provide increased ease of use. More particularly, the test devices include structural and functional elements that improve user handling and evaluation of the device.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Some commercially available assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell or device formed of an elongated outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive a fluid sample transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The use of the test cell requires a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single fluid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

For tests such as those described above, visually observable indicia can be preferred. Such indicia typically have included the presence of agglutination or a color change at a defined site on the assay. More recent efforts have included providing electronic (i.e., digital) signals as the observable indicia. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,763,454, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an electronic analyte assaying device that includes an electronic processing system and a liquid crystal display (LCD). The device includes a chromatographic medium and utilizes electronic components for evaluation of the test as well as display of the test results. Nevertheless, user interface with diagnostic test devices remain limited.

In particular, known point of care or over the counter diagnostic test devices lack an ergonomically favorable structure. As such, it is often difficult for a user to handle the device during application of the test fluid, such as from a urine stream, which can lead to either insufficient fluid application or device flooding. Because of these and other reasons, it would be beneficial to provide a personal use test device with improved ergonomic structure for ease of grip and use.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that include elements useful for carrying out an assay and for providing information related to the assay in an informative display. As an illustrative example, a pregnancy test device can be provided and can include elements for carrying out a test on a fluid sample applied to a receiving member so as to identify the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the sample that is indicative of a pregnancy status. The diagnostic test devices are adapted to provide improved ergonomics and ease of use of the devices in various methods.

In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a diagnostic test device. The device can comprise a lateral flow test component that is positioned inside a housing. Unlike known personal care test devices that are substantially straight, the presently disclosed test devices comprise a housing that is curved. In particular, the housing can include a substantially arch shaped handle. Further, the housing can comprise a housing body that is interconnected with the housing handle. The handle in some embodiments can be positioned so as to be entirely above the lower surface of the housing body.

Preferably, the diagnostic test device also comprises a base member that can be attached to a curved lower surface of the housing. The base member specifically can comprise a horizontal support surface. In some embodiments, the horizontal support surface can be substantially collinear with a lower surface of the housing body. Further, the base member can extend rearward from the lower surface of the housing body and can increase in height moving rearward. Beneficially, the horizontal support surface of the base member can effectively increase a support length of the lower surface of the housing body by about 5% or greater. Such support length can define the portion of the housing body that is in physical, supporting contact with a substantially flat, horizontal surface when the device is in an upward facing position. In some embodiments, the horizontal support surface of the base member can form an angle α with the curved lower surface of the housing. The value of the angle α can be, for example, about 5° or greater and, more particularly, can be about 5° to about 45°. The horizontal support surface of the base member can have a length of about 10 mm or greater or, more particularly, a length of about 10 mm to about 30 mm. In preferred embodiments, the base member can be monolithically formed with the housing. In some embodiments, the base member can be a single, unitary member. In other embodiments, the base member can be defined by a first base member wall and a second base member wall. Specifically, the base member walls can be curved. For example, the curved base member walls can be defined by a forward section and a rearward section, and the curved base member walls each can comprise a convex curve in the forward sections thereof and a concave curve in the rearward sections thereof with respect to outer surfaces of the walls. More particularly, the curved base member walls can define a width WBM1at the forward section thereof, a width WBM2at a central section thereof, and a width WBM3at the rearward section thereof. In some embodiments, the respective widths can be defined by the formula WBM1<WBM2>WBM3.

In certain embodiments, the housing body can be defined by a lower housing body and an upper housing body. The lower housing body can comprise a sidewall that is defined by an angle relative to a lower surface of the lower housing body. As an example, the angle can be greater than 0° and less than 90°. Similarly, the upper housing body can comprise a sidewall that is defined by an angle relative to an upper surface of the upper housing body. The angle also can be greater than 0° and less than 90°.

In some embodiments, the substantially arch shaped handle can be defined by an ascending section, a transverse section, and a descending section. Further, the handle can be defined by a total height h1that is a distance between an apex of an upper surface of the transverse section of the handle and a lower surface of the housing body, the height h1being about 15 mm or greater and more particularly about 15 mm to about 40 mm. The handle also can have a thickness Thandlethat can be, for example, about 6 mm to about 18 mm. The handle further can be defined by a partial height h2that is a distance between the apex of the upper surface of the transverse section of the handle and a bottom of a terminus of the handle, and h2can be defined by the formula h1>h2>Thandle.

In further embodiments, the substantially arch shaped handle can comprise a concavity (i.e., a thumb grip recess) on an upper surface thereof. The concavity can be defined specifically on the upper surface of the descending section of the handle. The handle also can comprise textures on a lower surface thereof. For instance, the textures can be defined by a plurality of raised members and can comprise, for example, rubber or a further elastomeric material.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can have a length that can be greater than similar devices in the field. For example, the housing in combination with a cap can have an overall length of about 14 to about 20 cm. In certain embodiments, the housing handle can comprise a significant proportion of the overall length of the housing. For example, the handle can comprise about 30% or greater, preferably about 40% or greater, of the total length of the housing.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can comprise additional elements as well. For example, in some embodiments, the housing further comprises a housing midsection interconnecting the housing body and the housing handle. Additionally, the housing further can comprise a display window. As noted above, the device also can comprise a cap that removably engages the housing, particularly at a forward end of the housing body, and can cover a sample receiving member extending outward from the housing body.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure particularly can be characterized by the nature of the sample receiving member extending outward from the housing at a forward end thereof. For example, the sample receiving member can have a surface area of about 15 cm2or greater, particularly about 15 cm2to about 25 cm2. The sample receiving member also can be defined by a thickness of about 1.5 mm to about 2.4 mm, a width of about 16 mm to about 20 mm, and a length of about 45 mm to about 55 mm.

The lateral flow test component provided in the housing of the diagnostic test device can comprise particular elements. In particular, the lateral flow test component can comprise a biphasic substrate or a triphasic substrate. The lateral flow test component similarly can comprise a release medium in fluid communication with a capture medium. Specifically, the release medium can comprise one or more releasably attached antibodies that are reactive with an analyte. In particular embodiments, the analyte can be selected from the group consisting of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, a metabolite thereof, and combinations thereof.

In another aspect, the present disclosure also can relate to a method for determining the presence of an analyte in a fluid sample. In some embodiments, the method can comprise the following steps: providing a diagnostic test device comprising a lateral flow test component positioned inside a housing that includes a substantially arch shaped handle and a display window, the lateral flow test component comprising a sample receiving member and one or more substrates adapted for release and capture of one or more antibodies; applying a fluid sample to the sample receiving member; and observing a test result in the display window, the test result being indicative of the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample.

In yet another aspect, the present disclosure can relate to a method for evaluating a test result of a personal use diagnostic test device. In some embodiments, the method can comprise the following steps: carrying out a test with a diagnostic test device comprising a lateral flow test component positioned inside a housing that comprises a housing body interconnected with a substantially arch shaped handle, a display window on an upper surface of the housing by which the test result is visible, and a base member attached to a curved lower surface of the housing; positioning the diagnostic test device at an angle relative to a substantially flat, horizontal surface such that the diagnostic test device is self-maintained at the angle. The diagnostic test device may incorporate a variety of structural components that facilitate self-maintenance of the angled positioning. In one embodiment, the self-maintenance means can be defined by a three point contact with the substantially flat, horizontal surface; and viewing the visible test result in the display window. In particular embodiments, the three point contact can be defined by contact between the substantially flat, horizontal surface and each of a wall of the base member, a side wall of the housing body, and a side wall of the handle. More particularly, the substantially arch shaped handle can be defined by an ascending section and a descending section, and the side wall of the handle defining one of the three point contacts can be in the descending section thereof. In specific embodiments, the angle of the device relative to the substantially flat, horizontal surface can be greater than 0° and less than 90°, more particularly about 10° to about 85°.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to depilatory compositions which can be peeled away from the skin.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As an alternative to shaving, many hair removal products available today perform through either chemical degradation (depilation) or mechanical removal (epilation) of the hair. Compositions for removing superfluous body hair are well known and are of various types. Currently on the market there are many different types of chemical depilatories and epilation products. Epilatory products, such as waxing, require initial heating before being applied to the skin in a generally molten state. It is then allowed to solidify before being removed from the skin together with unwanted hair.

One major drawback with waxing is the pain associated with hair removal. Waxing works by pulling the hair out from the roots. The hair follicle is surrounded by a small muscle that allows the hair to be erected in response to cold or excitement. Also attached with this muscle are nerve endings.

These structures make pulling the hair out fairly hard and painful. The pain creates a fear associated with the waxing procedure which will cause many people not to repeat the procedure. Even if the person does repeat the waxing, the fear can cause the muscles to tense up, which in turn creates even more pain in subsequent procedures.

Chemical-based depilation offers an attractive alternative to waxing or shaving with the removal of hair being accomplished through the cleavage of disulfide bonds in the hair fiber as well as denaturation of the associated protein matrix. Unlike waxing, chemical-based depilation digests the hair and the hair is not pulled out, thus avoiding the pain associated with waxing. However, a relatively small proportion of individuals, compared with shaving, employ depilatories. One reason for the limited use may be that the hair cleavage reaction must be run at a very high pH. A typical example is the Nair® lotion product, having a pH of about 12.5 to 13.

Chemical-based depilatory compositions typically use a thiol-based depilatory agent, such as thioglycolic acid, for removal of unwanted body and facial hair and its use is well established in the art. These agents react by reducing hair's protein disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl anions, thereby allowing easy removal of the weakened hairs when washed or wiped away. However, in using thiols, it was discovered that certain conditions facilitated the effectiveness of this reaction. One such condition is high alkalinity to provide ionized reactants. Not only does the high pH (approximately 12.0-13) result in ionized thiols, but they also result in increased penetration of a reactant. Substances to provide further enhancement of penetration by active thiols were developed.

Currently on the market there are many different types of chemical depilatories. They range in form from creams to gel to aerosol mousses and spray products. Depilatory composition in the form of a cream is applied to the skin at room temperature. One drawback to many of these depilatory products is the required clean up. As discussed earlier, chemical depilatories contain a strong alkaline, usually a metal hydroxide. In addition, there is usually a reducing agent used. These chemicals can cause considerable damage to the skin if not properly removed. Likewise, they will quickly cause significant damage if they get into the eyes. Product wiped off the skin is still active and will corrode aluminum and many organic materials, creating the possibility of property damage or injury to the user, children or pets through inadvertent contact.

Products have been made to help reduce the risks associated with using these high pH depilatory products by trapping the dangerous chemicals in a solid matrix, i.e., a semi-solid film, after use, thereby simplifying disposal because there will not be liquid which can stick to surfaces. These depilatory products form a dry rubbery film on the skin which after a period of a few minutes can be peeled in one piece from the skin. In this manner, the product is similar to a hot wax depilation. After removal of the product, a very slight residue is left behind, which could be removed with a damp towel. However, unlike wax, the hair will have been digested by chemicals and not pulled out, thereby avoiding the pain associated with pulling out hair as in waxing. Further, there is the elimination of a great deal of mess. European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 to Hori et al. describes such a product.

European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 describes a depilatory composition comprising an aqueous solution or emulsion (e.g. a paste or gel) of a depilatory agent, a film-forming polymer (such as poly(vinyl alcohol)), which can be water-soluble or insoluble, and optionally an alkali hair swelling accelerating agent or a filler. The composition of European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 is spread on an area of skin having hair, the coating is allowed to dry naturally or by treating with hot air and/or absorbing water into an absorbent sheet pressed onto the film; and the film is peeled off with the hairs embedded therein, optionally with use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet placed on the film.

In using these depilatory compositions, it is advantageous to have compositions which are capable of forming films when they are applied to the skin. Compositions having film-forming properties have the advantages of facilitating the removal of the depilatory composition from the skin and the ease of disposal of the depilatory composition along with the digested hairs simply by peeling off the dried composition.

The components imparting the above-noted film-forming properties are generally high-molecular-weight polymers. To obtain substantial film-forming properties in depilatory compositions, it is not satisfactory to simply increase the concentration of these high-molecular-weight polymers in the depilatory compositions. Such an approach is indeed limited by the fact that these film-forming polymers excessively increase the viscosity of the finished product. The finished product becomes too thick; it is thus difficult to apply to the skin and therefore preventing the user from being able to properly apply the depilatory composition.

It would be most useful to formulate a depilatory composition with substantial film-forming properties, but in such a way that the viscosity of depilatory composition is low enough to properly apply to the skin as a thin film prior to forming a film.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In some embodiments, methods and devices for the detection of an analyte in a body fluid using a plurality of species-specific antibodies are provided.

2. Description of the Related Art

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of analytes in body fluids such as saliva, urine or blood. These assays typically involve antigen-antibody reactions, synthetic conjugates comprising enzymatic, fluorescent, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most of these assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) specific for the selected analyte (e.g., antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of the antigen-antibody reaction product. Although some commercially available tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative indication (e.g., positive/negative). Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, ovulation prediction and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Diagnostic assays should generally be very sensitive because of the often low concentrations of analytes of interest present in a test fluid. False positives can be problematic, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed that rely on the interaction between avidin and biotin-tagged antibodies. For example, in some commercially available pregnancy tests, an antibody-antigen sandwich complex comprising a colloidal gold-labeled anti-hCG antibody and an anti-hCG biotin-labeled antibody is used.

Because the above disclosed assays and methods enable the formation of antibody-antigen sandwich complexes in the liquid phase of an assay prior to the test line, they allow for more time for antigen recognition and binding to occur. These assays and methods therefore have greater sensitivity and discrimination for analytes of interest, resulting in greater reproducibility, sensitivity, and avoidance of false positives. Although such advances have improved these types of assays, further improvements in reliability and ease of manufacture are desirable.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides rapid, sensitive diagnostic devices and methods for detecting the presence of analytes in body fluids. In preferred embodiments, these methods and devices have high sensitivity and result in virtually no false positives, enabling reliable results even when used by untrained persons.

In preferred embodiments, a mixed-species lateral flow assay is provided, whereby an antibody-antigen sandwich complex is captured at a test result site thorough the recognition of a species-specific antibody in the sandwich complex. The antibodies in this antibody-antigen sandwich complex are derived from different species, allowing an antibody-antigen sandwich complex to be captured at the test line by an antibody that recognizes only one of the species-specific antibodies in the sandwich complex.

A device for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The device includes a release medium forming an upstream portion of the device; at least two primary antibodies that recognize the analyte and are derived from at least two different species, where at least two primary antibodies are located in or on the release medium; a capture medium forming a downstream portion of the device; and at least one secondary antibody specific for only one of the at least two primary antibodies, where the at least one secondary antibody is located in or on the capture medium.

In some embodiments, a first one of the at least two primary antibodies is conjugated to a label, and a second one of the at least two primary antibodies is unconjugated. In some embodiments, a first antibody of the at least one secondary antibody is specific for the species from which the second one of the at least two primary antibodies is derived. In some embodiments, a second secondary antibody is located in or on the capture medium that is specific for the species from which the first one of the at least two primary antibodies is derived. In some embodiments, the first and second ones of the at least two primary antibodies in or on the release medium are deposited in or on different locations of the release medium. In some embodiments, the first and second secondary antibodies in or on the capture medium are immobilized in or on different locations of the capture medium. In some embodiments, neither of the two primary antibodies are tagged with a capturable moiety or component such as biotin.

In another embodiment, a device for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The device includes a release medium comprising: a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member derived from a first species and a label, where the binding member is reactive with a first epitope of the analyte; and a capturable component derived from a second species, where the capturable component is reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a sandwich complex is formed comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte, and the capturable component; and a capture medium comprising a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component having specificity for the capturable component.

In another embodiment, a method of determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The method includes forming a sandwich complex comprising a first primary antibody derived from a first species, the analyte, and a second primary antibody derived from a second, different species; and capturing the sandwich complex with a secondary antibody specific for only one of the first and second different species.

In another embodiment, a method for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The method includes contacting the liquid sample with a release medium comprising: a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member derived from a first species, where the binding member is reactive with a first epitope of the analyte, and where the binding member is labeled with a detectable marker; and a capturable component derived from a second species, wherein the capturable component is reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte and the capturable component is formed. The method further comprises contacting the liquid sample with a capture medium following exposure to the release medium, where the capture medium comprises a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component having specificity for the capturable component; and determining whether the analyte is present in the liquid sample by detecting the presence of the detectable marker at the capture site.

This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/373,118 filed Aug. 12, 2010 and takes priority therefrom.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed toward a detergent pouch with improved properties. In particular, at least two water-soluble films are sealed together to prepare the detergent pouch, which further contains a detergent composition. At least one flexibility-imparting agent is mixed within the detergent composition, or coated onto the detergent pouch. The flexibility-imparting agent provides the pouch with a flexibility that surprisingly minimizes leakage and cracking of the pouch under stress or unfavorable environmental conditions.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Pouch compositions are known in the art. These compositions have an advantage in that they are easy to dose, handle, transport and store. Recently, water-soluble pouches that contain cleaning or fabric care compositions have become popular.

Typically, the film material that is used to prepare water-soluble pouches is relatively fragile, thin, and must have a high water-reactivity, so that the pouches can release the contained product quickly and completely without leaving residue. However, when the pouches are under stresses from production, packing, transportation, or have been exposed to a moist environment, the thin film material often leads to a premature release of the contained product. Furthermore, when the film material is exposed to low temperature conditions, the pouches may become susceptible to cold shock cracking and failure. Pouched commercial products currently on the market often encounter the above-mentioned difficulties.

Meanwhile, the packaging of additives and the dispensing of compositions into the pouches can also be problematic. For example, additives such as auxiliary agents are typically incorporated within pouched cleaning products as moisture sinkers, but they are often contained separately from the detergent in the same unit dose (i.e. pouch), so that each component can retain its stability prior to consumer usage. Furthermore, it is important to have the detergent in a free-flow, solid particulate form prior to its dispensing into a unit dose, so that a filling machine that packages the pouch can meter and dispense a precise amount of the detergent. Precision in metering and packaging is critical to ensure safety for consumer handling, to reduce the environmental impact caused by excessive cleaning products, and to reduce material cost. Currently, industry practices known in the art have not optimized the packaging of additives with detergent in the same unit dose, so that that the pouch is made to minimize cracks and leakage, and that the detergent composition remains free flowing to be packaged.

Various methods and compositions are known in the prior art, to treat water-soluble films or to reduce moisture within water-soluble pouches. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,259,134 to Beckholt et al., which discloses a multi-compartmented pouch that contains one compartment that has a liquid composition. The liquid composition comprises a moisture regulator system made from a mixture of C2-C6monoalkylene polyol and C2-C3monoalkylene polyol. While another compartment has a hygroscopic powder to absorb the moisture.

Another example is U.S. Patent Application Number 2008/0020220 to Maurer et al., which discloses a PVOH film that has been pretreated exteriorly with a salt solution, to provide resistance to an accidental exposure to water.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,648,951 to Sharma et al, which discloses a multi-compartment pouch that contains a moisture-sensitive detergent active, and a humectant in a separate compartment to act as a moisture sink for the detergent.

Another example is U.S. Patent Application Number 2004/0182049 to Duffield, which discloses a PVOH film that has been pre-treated on both sides with a mixture of water, salt, and a water-soluble polymer prior to heat sealing. The film treatment increases the dissolution rate of the sealed area.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,201,819 to Wiedemann et al., which discloses the incorporation of a detergent in liquid, gel or paste form in a sealed package made of a film, wherein the film was pre-treated with glycerol and heat to avoid crumbling and wrinkle formation.

Finally, U.S. Patent Application 2009/0312220 to Boutoille et al. discloses the formation of a multi-compartmented PVA pouch, which contains a powder detergent therein. The PVA film has been pretreated with a wetting agent such as a plasticizer, to increase its malleability prior to pouching.

However, the above-mentioned references neither mention or address the technical problems that are related to pouch-handling under stress conditions, such as cold shock and cracking, or the difficulties of simultaneously flexing the pouch and maintaining the free-flow characteristic of the solid particulate detergent composition.

Thus, an objective of the present invention is to provide a flexible detergent pouch that contains a detergent composition therein. Another objective is to incorporate at least one flexibility-imparting agent within the detergent composition, so that the pouch subsequently becomes flexible and that the detergent composition remains free flowing. A further objective is to provide a detergent pouch whose flexibility does not decrease considerably with time.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A detergent pouch is prepared by sealing at least two water-soluble polymeric films together, and further contains a detergent composition. The pouch has at least one flexibility-imparting agent that is coated onto the pouch. In another embodiment, if the detergent composition is a powder, the flexibility-imparting agent is mixed with the detergent composition. The flexibility-imparting agent makes the pouch surprisingly flexible to minimize leakage or cracks under stress or unfavorable environmental conditions.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to cleaning products, and more particularly to unit dose cleaning products for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Peroxide-based bleaching agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, sodium persulfate, sodium perphosphate, urea peroxide, and sodium perborate) act as effective oxidizers for whitening substrates, removing stains, and disinfecting surfaces. Peroxide-based bleaching agents promote a bleaching effect on organic materials and thus are used with detergents in cleaning compositions, and are also used for bleaching textiles and paper, among other applications. The bleaching effect is particularly strong in washing and cleaning processes.

Generally, to clean a soiled substrate such as clothing, the substrate is treated with hydrogen peroxide or a substance capable of generating perhydroxyl ions (HOO—), such as inorganic or organic peroxides as exemplified above. Upon contact with the surface of the soiled substrate, the peroxide effectively removes common stains such as coffee or wine, while disinfecting the surface. Compared to more volatile hypochlorite-based bleaches, peroxide-based bleaching agents exhibit environmental benefits including enhanced safety and reduced pollution. However, peroxide-based bleaching agents do not perform at the same level of cleaning efficacy as hypochlorite-based bleaches.

Peroxide bleach activating agents, or bleach activators, such as, for example, acyl compounds (e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamene (TAED)) and ester compounds (e.g., isononanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (ISONOBS) and nonanoyloxybenzene-sulfonate (NOBS)), and the like, can be added to boost activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents. It has been found that the level of peroxide bleaching activity typically generated at 95° C. by peroxide alone can be achieved at 60° C. with the addition of bleach activators. The bleach activator reacts in the presence of the peroxide-based bleaching agent to generate peracetic acid, which is a more potent oxidizer than hydrogen peroxide.

Liquid formulations containing such bleach activators have met limited consumer success due to a lack of sufficient stability. When the liquid compositions are formulated with dissolved peroxide compounds, the resulting composition is especially unstable, and thus, prone to rapid loss of bleaching efficacy. To prolong stability, the cleaning composition containing peroxide and bleach activator is typically packaged with the actives physically segregated or in an anhydrous environment. This can be achieved by dispersing the actives either in a suspension segregating the peroxide and bleach activator in different liquid phases or blending them in a dry powder form.

Powder and dual-phase liquid formulations are generally less desirable especially for consumer use as compared to other forms of cleaning compositions. Even when maintained in an anhydrous environment (i.e., powder and dual-phase liquid), the bleach activator can still react with the peroxide. Over time, the bleach activator and peroxide degrade leading to reduced efficacy.

Accordingly, there is a need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent that is formulated to alleviate the limitations described above and which prevents premature degradation of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent. There is a further need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent comprising a cleaning composition of the peroxide-based bleaching agent and a peroxide bleach activating agent, having improved stability over time, while enhancing convenience and ease of use for the consumer. There is also a need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent that promotes cleaning of substrates in a more environmentally-friendly manner.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent. The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention is specifically formulated for enhanced cleaning (bleaching) activity, while substantially improving peroxide stability and therefore providing an extended shelf-life. The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention utilizes a combination of a peroxide-containing bleaching agent and a peroxide bleach activating agent for enhanced bleaching activity, formulated for improved stability over time with minimal loss of efficacy during storage. The configuration of the unit dose cleaning product also provides a vehicle to delay immediate release of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent until the product is completely dispersed in an aqueous environment. This delay substantially minimizes premature interaction between the peroxide-containing bleaching agent and the peroxide bleach activating agent, thereby maximizing cleaning efficacy.

The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention is especially formulated for cleaning soiled substrates, such as, for example, laundry and dishware. The unit dose cleaning product is designed to provide a self-contained single-dose package that permits the consumer to dispense the product without the need to measure the amount of the active agent. In this manner, the unit dose cleaning product of the present invention enhances ease of use and dispensing for reduced waste, and at least minimizes skin contact with potentially irritating ingredients.

In particular, the unit dose cleaning product of the present invention includes a cleaning composition of a peroxide-containing bleaching agent component comprising a peroxide-containing bleaching agent, preferably in the form of anhydrous particles encapsulated in a first at least partially water soluble material. The cleaning composition also contains a peroxide bleach activating agent component containing a peroxide bleach activating agent, preferably in the form of a non-aqueous liquid. A pouch comprising a second at least partially water soluble material enclosing the cleaning composition is also provided. The first at least partially water soluble material of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component has a substantially longer dissolution time than the second at least partially water soluble material of the pouch. Optionally, the cleaning composition of the present unit dose cleaning product further includes one or more surfactants, detergents and enzymes, each in amounts effective for promoting cleaning of soiled substrates.

As used herein, the term “encapsulate” is used in its customary and ordinary sense where the first at least partially water soluble material provides a barrier which protects the material contained therein (the peroxide-containing bleaching agent) until the first at least partially water soluble material begins to dissolve.

The term “enclosing” refers to the second at least partially water soluble material forming a pouch which protects the contents of the cleaning composition (including the encapsulated peroxide-containing bleaching agent) until the second at least partially water soluble material begins to dissolve.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent, comprising:

a peroxide-containing bleaching agent component comprising a peroxide-containing bleaching agent and a first at least partially water soluble material encapsulating the peroxide-containing bleaching agent;

a peroxide bleach activating agent component comprising a peroxide bleach activating agent, and having the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component dispersed therein forming a cleaning composition; and

a pouch comprising a second at least partially water soluble material enclosing the cleaning composition, wherein the first at least partially water soluble material of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component exhibits a substantially longer dissolution time than the second at least partially water soluble material of the pouch. Optionally, the peroxide bleach activating agent is in the form of a non-aqueous liquid.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of cleaning soiled substrates, comprising:

dissolving the unit dose cleaning product described above in water to form a cleaning solution; and

contacting the cleaning solution with the soiled substrates to remove soils therefrom.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The field of the present invention relates generally to condoms, and more specifically to condoms having a lubricant system which imparts warmth, or provides a warming effect or sensation upon use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of lubrication systems for condoms are disclosed in the art. Some of the lubricants employed are sold or supplied separately as so-called personal lubricants, while others are applied to condoms prior to packaging. Some lubricants have particular physiological effects. For example, Heidenfelder (U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,188) discloses the coating of the interior surface of a condom with a local anesthetic such as benzocaine to provide desensitization.

The instant invention is directed to a condom together with a lubricant which provides a warming effect or sensation upon use. This effect is in contrast to the cooling sensation imparted by conventional lubricants.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally provides a condom in combination with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols. Such glycols, provided they are present in an environment relatively free from unbound water, will warm upon contact with compositions containing unbound water. Such warming of glycol based condom lubricants results in a warming sensation during condom use.

In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a condom comprising:

A male genital engaging tubular sheath having an inner surface and an outer surface together with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols in a mixture containing little or no unbound water, such that said lubricating composition warms upon contact with compositions containing free or unbound water.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device, U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to novel liquid cleaning detergent compositions containing peroxide and a catalyst.

BACKGROUND

Hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used for many years for a variety of purposes, including bleaching, disinfecting, and cleaning a variety of things and surfaces ranging from skin, hair, and mucous membranes to contact lenses to household and industrial surfaces and instruments. In particular, peroxide-containing bleaching agents have long been used in washing and cleaning processes. When soiled clothing is contacted with such bleaching compositions, usually by washing the soiled clothing in the presence of the bleaching composition at the boil, the bleaching agent functions to remove such common domestic stains as tea, coffee, fruit and wine stains from clothing.

Traditionally, to clean a substrate such as clothing, the substrate is subjected to hydrogen peroxide, or to substances which can generate hydroperoxyl radicals, such as inorganic or organic peroxides. Generally, these peroxide systems must be activated in order to work properly. One method of activating the system is to employ wash temperatures of 60° C. or higher, but it is often advantageous to wash laundry in cold water (e.g., temperatures from about 2-24° C.). Washing in cold water generally conserves energy and therefore costs less money than washing in warm water. Other advantages include potentially less damage to clothes. However, if the washing temperature is reduced to below 60° C., the efficacy of the peroxides in the bleaching agent is correspondingly reduced.

In order to avoid having to employ wash temperatures of 60° C. or higher, it is well-known that certain heavy metals, or complexes thereof, function to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, or of compounds which are capable of liberating hydrogen peroxide, in order to render the peroxide compound effective at temperatures below 60° C. Various transition metal ions added in the form of suitable salts, and coordination compounds containing such cations, are known to activate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In that manner, by using certain heavy metals as catalysts, it is possible for the bleaching effect (which is unsatisfactory at lower temperatures) of H2O2, or precursors that release H2O2and of other peroxo compounds, to be increased.

In terms of H2O2activation having effective bleaching action, mononuclear and polynuclear variants of manganese complexes having various ligands, especially 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane and optionally oxygen-containing bridging ligands, are currently regarded as being especially effective. Such catalysts are adequately stable under practical conditions and, with Mnn+, contain an ecologically acceptable metal cation, but their use is unfortunately associated with considerable damage to dyes and fibres.

For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,511, there is described the activation of a peroxy compound by a complex formed from a transition metal (Mn, Co, Fe or Cu) and a non-(macro)cyclic ligand, preferably 2,2-bispyridylamine or 2,2-bispyridylmethane.

Moreover, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,606, there is disclosed a manganese complex, for use as a bleach catalyst for a peroxy compound, which is a water-soluble complex of manganese II, III or IV, or mixtures thereof, with a ligand which is a non-carboxylate polyhydroxy compound, having at least three consecutive C—OH groups in its molecular structure, preferably sorbitol.

The incorporation of some ingredients into detergent compositions is problematic. Detergent compositions are often stored for some time and interactions may occur between active components such that a reduction in the amount of the active component may result. This can be particularly problematic in the presence of moisture.

Many ways of protecting and delivering sensitive, highly active, low dosage detergent components have been suggested. In EP-A-0072166, EP-A-0124341, EP-A-224952 and WO 95/06710, heavy metal complexes are incorporated into detergent compositions in agglomerated or aggregate form in order to improve storage stability. In EP-A-170346, bleach catalysts are adsorbed onto solid silicon supports. In EP-A-141 470, heavy metal ion catalysts are protected by selecting specific ligands and then providing a protective coating; in EP-A-141472, micronised coatings are described. In EP-A-544 440, gelled polymers are used; in WO 95/33817, wax encapsulation is used requiring a surfactant in the particle. Unfortunately, coating methods are costly and coated/encapsulated particles are vulnerable to fissures or incomplete coatings leading to loss of the active component(s) in the particle.

Problems arise in the addition to the formulation or incorporation of a bleaching (agent) components when the composition is a liquid, particularly aqueous washing and cleaning agents that are enjoying an increased popularity due to their positive product properties, such as a better and faster solubility and practicality. Due to the decomposition reactions or hydrolysis and incompatibilities towards other constituents of the washing agent formulation, such as, e.g., enzymes or surfactants, the added bleaching agents often lose their activity already on storage or even during product utilization. An adverse consequence resulting from this is that the washing performance—particularly the bleaching power—of the washing agent formulation noticeably deteriorates, such that bleachable stains in particular can no longer be satisfactorily removed.

Bleaching agents, such as for example perborates or percarbonates, which are usually used in solid washing agent formulations, are extremely moisture sensitive, with the result that they often lose their bleaching power within a few days in a liquid and particularly aqueous washing or cleaning agents, due to the loss of active oxygen.

Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide caused by catalytically active substances, such as metal ions, is extremely difficult to prevent. For products that contain hydrogen peroxide to be effective, a substantial proportion of the hydrogen peroxide must survive between manufacture and use. In addition, decomposition produces oxygen gas, which could overpressure the container and cause it to rupture during storage or shipping. Examples of such compositions are given, for example, in Kott, U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,739; Scialla, U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,090; Monticello, U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,774; and Kandathil, U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,192.

Liquid detergent compositions offer several advantages over solid compositions. For example, liquid compositions are easier to measure and dispense. Additionally, liquid compositions are especially useful for direct application to heavily soiled areas on fabrics, after which the pre-treated fabrics can be placed in an aqueous bath for laundering in the ordinary manner.

Unfortunately, unless very stringent conditions are met, hydrogen peroxide solutions begin to decompose into O2gas and water within an extremely short time. Typical hydrogen peroxide solutions in use for these purposes are in the range of from about 0.5 to about 6% by weight of hydrogen peroxide in water. The rate at which such dilute hydrogen peroxide solutions decompose will, of course, be dependent upon such factors as pH and the presence of trace amounts of various metal impurities, such as copper or chromium, which may act to catalytically decompose the same. Moreover, at moderately elevated temperatures, the rate of decomposition of such dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions is greatly accelerated. Hence, hydrogen peroxide solutions which have been stabilized against peroxide breakdown are in very great demand.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The objective of this invention is to develop a stable, liquid bleach composition that contains a peroxide-based bleaching agent, water, and a metal catalyst. The present invention contains a polyol as a secondary solvent to promote peroxide stability in the presence of a catalyst.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to diagnostic assays for analytes in a fluid sample. In particular, the invention relates to devices, methods, and test kits for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid.

Description of the Related Art

Detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine samples is routinely used to determine a woman's pregnant/non-pregnant status. Traditional one-step pregnancy test devices detect hCG by utilizing a double antibody system in a lateral flow format resulting in a “sandwich” complex of hCG, a capture antibody and a labeled antibody, which is captured at a specific detection area on a test strip. A digital version of the pregnancy test device consists of an opto-electronic reader powered by an internal battery that measures the absorbance/reflectance of the label particles specifically captured at the detection area of the test strip and automatically subtracts any non-specific background color from an adjacent area of the test strip that is outside the detection area. The adjusted measurement of absorbance/reflectance of accumulated label particles at the detection area is then compared to a preset threshold value and further processed into a clearly read YES+/PREGNANT or NO−/NOT PREGNANT digital result on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.

Although electronic readers provide the added convenience of eliminating the end-user step of interpreting the results of the test, a step required in traditional lateral flow devices, there is room for improvements. For an electronic reader system that incorporates a lateral flow test strip, one of the many challenges in increasing the detection sensitivity is the unpredictability of uneven migration of resolubilized reagents and sample flow which can affect the electronic interpretation of the test result resulting in an inaccurate test result determination. Unlike the lateral flow pregnancy test where the consumer merely looks for the presence of a line irrespective of its color intensity and its uniformity, in a digital pregnancy test it is extremely important that the test line is uniform in color intensity. However, this is not always possible due to the reasons cited above. Therefore, improved devices, methods, and test kits for electronic analyte assaying digital detection are desirable.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to deposition processes, and more particularly, systems for depositing an imprint onto a substrate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Printing is a process of depositing a substance onto the surface of a substance receiving substrate to produce graphic images (e.g., text and designs). A typical example of printing involves depositing ink on paper using a printing press. The development of print technologies has provided major progress in many areas on a large scale basis including the dissemination of information and the manufacture of goods relying on such technologies. Two print methods commonly used for depositing or printing graphic images onto the receiving substrate are lithographic printing and screen printing.

Lithographic printing utilizes printing plates having patterns formed from a series of grooves into which a thick ink is initially deposited with a suitable applicator. The grooves are configured for retaining a quantity of ink, while the areas adjacent to the grooves are rendered free of ink through careful wiping and scraping. The corresponding pattern is transferred after impressing the ink-loaded grooves onto the substrate surface with sufficient pressure whereby the surface contacts the ink retained in the grooves. This method of printing is relatively inexpensive and the resolution, density and quality of the printed image is generally adequate. However, when used on soft, elastomeric materials, the printed images are less satisfactory.

Screen printing is a print method suitable for use on a wide range of materials including textiles, ceramics, wood, paper, glass, metal and plastic. The method involves the use of a woven mesh or screen supported on a frame. An ink-blocking stencil is formed by blocking off parts of the screen in the negative image of the print. The open, unblocked parts representing the positive image of the print permit passage of the ink unto the substrate surface. The ink is pressed through the open areas of the screen to deposit a sharp-edged image onto the substrate surface below. A fill blade or squeegee is generally used to force ink into the mesh openings by moving it across the stencil screen to promote transfer through capillary action. Screen printing is more versatile than traditional printing techniques. The surface does not have to be printed under pressure and it does not have to be planar or flat. Screen printing also provides good color depth, enhanced definition and overall better quality images.

High-throughput commercial printing utilizes solvent-based inks to ensure rapid drying and good adhesion to the substrate surface. However, such inks suffer several drawbacks. Certain substrates, such as those composed of an elastomeric material, are not compatible with such solvent-based inks. These inks are formulated with solvents that usually penetrate the elastomeric material causing temporary physical changes such as swelling. Although the elastomeric material eventually returns to its original state as the solvent evaporates, its physical properties including barrier integrity may be adversely affected. In addition to the problem of incompatibility with elastomeric materials, solvent-based inks contain components that pose potentially harmful health effects on humans through contact with such inks printed on such elastomeric materials.

Accordingly, there is a need for a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate, especially tubular or cylindrically-shaped substrates. There is also a need for a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate with improved precision and accuracy.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate. The system of the present invention is configured for depositing an imprint onto a substrate to produce graphic images including visual and/or tactile textures thereon. In this manner, the present invention can be implemented to form decorative and/or functional elements on the surface of the substrate. The system of the present invention is configured particularly for fabrication of articles that are at least substantially safe for prolonged contact with human tissue including the skin and mucous membranes.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate, including:a deposition surface having at least one outlet disposed therein;a substrate holder for holding the substrate against the deposition surface;means operatively associated with the deposition surface for supplying a material through the at least one outlet to deposit the material onto the substrate; anda spacer member disposed between the deposition surface and the substrate.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to bottle filling/capping. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for positioning, a bottle neck during filling and/or capping.

An exemplary bottle filling/capping method and apparatus is illustrated in the context of a laundry detergent bottle. However, it may apply to other bottles.

In an exemplary bottle filling/capping process, bottles move along a flowpath through a series of operations. Exemplary operations may include filling, cap applying, labeling, inspection, and the like.

These may be further subdivided. For example, with laundry detergent bottles, capping may, involve a two-step process of first installing a spout fitment and then installing a cap. Alternatively, the spout fitment may be installed prior to filling. One exemplary group of bottles is shown in US Pre-Grant Publication No. 2009/0101682A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety as if set forth at length.

At various points along the flowpath, the bottles may need to be precisely positioned. One example involves positioning the bottle at capping where filled bottles (optionally with spout fitments preinstalled) receive caps and the caps are screwed down. More particularly, the cap may be screwed to a pre-installed spout fitment or the spout fitment with cap pre-installed may be screwed onto the bottle or snapped onto the bottle. In yet further variations, spout fitment pre-installation may be internal so that the cap screws onto the bottle.

To the extent that the bottles are not centered relative to the cap being delivered, the cap may fail to be properly installed and may damage the bottle and/or foul the assembly line. It is, therefore, desirable that the capping station precisely register the bottle relative to the cap being installed.

For registering the bottles, it is known to use a guide wheel having a circumferential array of guide members for engaging the bottle. The wheel rotates with the flowpath passing tangentially by or around the wheel so that at least one guide member may engage a bottle adjacent one or more associated capping tools. Exemplary capping tools each comprise one or more actuators for downwardly inserting the cap and rotating the cap to tighten it.

The exemplary guides have recesses nearly semicircular in planform (e.g., a circular are in the vicinity of 180°).

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

One aspect of the disclosure involves a bottle handling apparatus for handling bottles of a nominal neck radius. The apparatus has a carrier and a plurality of bottle guides mounted to the carrier and each comprising a bottle-engaging recess. The bottle-engaging recess comprises means for accommodating necks of different eccentricities.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the means comprising a central concave region of a radius of curvature less than the nominal neck radius and regions outboard of the central region on opposite sides thereof having less concavity than the central region.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the means comprising means for providing two circumferentially-spaced contact locations 80-100° from each other with a circular neck of said nominal neck radius.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the means comprising means for providing two circumferentially-spaced contact locations separated by a non-contact gap of at least 45° with a circular neck of said nominal neck radius.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include a method for using the apparatus. The method comprises: passing a plurality of the bottle bodies along a flowpath; and actuating the carrier to engage the guides to the bottle bodies as the bottle bodies in the flowpath pass the carrier, the engagement engaging the bottle neck to the guide recess.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the engagement providing two circumferentially-spaced contact locations 80-100° from each other with a circular neck of said nominal neck radius.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include a circumferential outer rail providing a third contact location.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the engagement providing two circumferentially-spaced contact locations separated by a non-contact gap of at least 45° with a circular neck of said nominal neck radius.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the actuating comprising rotating the carrier.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include aligning the guide to a chuck.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include: as a first bottle passes through the apparatus, there are two spaced-apart contact locations with the guide; as a second bottle passes through the apparatus, the second bottle neck having a greater eccentricity than the first bottle neck, there are two contact locations with the guide shifted outward along the guide recess; and as a third bottle passes through the apparatus, the third bottle neck having a greater eccentricity than the second bottle neck, there are two contact locations with the guide shifted further outward along the guide recess.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the second bottle having at least 5% eccentricity and a center of the second bottle shifts radially relative to a center of the first bottle by no more than 2% of a nominal neck diameter of the first bottle, more particularly, no more than 1%.

Another aspect of the disclosure involves a bottle handling apparatus for handling bottles of a nominal neck (70) radius. The apparatus comprises: a carrier; and a plurality of bottle guides mounted to the carrier and each comprising a bottle-engaging recess, wherein the bottle-engaging recess comprises: a central concave first region of a radius of curvature less than the nominal neck radius; and second regions outboard of the central region on opposite sides thereof being less concave than the central region.

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include: the second regions have curvature magnitude at least 5 times the nominal neck radius; and the second regions are positioned to contact the neck for eccentricities from zero (circularity) to at least 5% (more particularly at least 10% or at least 15%).

A further embodiment may additionally and/or alternatively include the second regions outboard having curvature magnitude at least 10 times the nominal neck radius.

The details of one or more embodiments of the invention are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and drawings, and from the claims.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

Certain aspects of the present invention generally relate to devices and methods for the electrochemical detection and quantitation of analyte in a sample.

Background

Point of care (POC) diagnostic tests are convenient and inexpensive devices useful for the detection of a target molecule, in a sample. POC tests are employed in a variety of settings, including for medical, consumer, or environmental purposes because of the low cost, ease of use, and, portability that they afford. POC tests have become increasingly popular in part because of the rapidity with which results are achieved and for the flexibility of configuring the devices for a variety of applications.

The lateral flow assay (LFA) is a POC diagnostic tool that is capable of determining the presence or absence of an analyte, typically, through visual observation of a discernible color change. One common example of such LFA tests is the conventional household pregnancy test. LFAs generally involve the use of a labeled antibody deposited at a first position on a solid substrate. Sample is applied to the first position, causing the labeled antibody to reconstitute in solution, whereupon the antibody binds to complementary analyte in the sample. Alternatively, labeled antibody is mixed with the sample prior to application on the LFA. In either case, a complex of analyte and antibody forms. The analyte-antibody complex flows along the liquid front from the first location through the solid substrate to a second location, a test line, where an immobilized antibody is located. The immobilized antibody captures the analyte through specific interaction, resulting in a high concentration of labeled antibody at the test line. The high concentration of labeled antibody provides a detectable visual signal. Gold nanoparticles are typically used to label the antibodies because they are relatively inexpensive and provide easily observable color indications based on the surface, plasmon resonance properties of gold nanoparticles. In many cases, this signal is used to, provide only, qualitative, information, such as whether or not the analyte is present in the sample.

FIGS. 1A and 1Bdepict a conventional one-step sandwich LFA12, as described in the prior art. The sandwich LFA12is comprised of a substrate13over or through which the liquid sample flows. The sandwich LFA12comprises an upstream region15and a downstream region17. Deposited on the substrate13at a first, region14are antibodies24conjugated to a visually or optically detectable particle25, such as a gold nanoparticle. When a sample is applied to the upstream region15of the substrate13, it may, flow over or through the substrate13to the downstream region17of the substrate13. The labeled antibodies are reconstituted by the sample liquid when the sample flows to and through the first region14. The labeled antibodies are reactive to a first epitope on an analyte of interest27which may be present in the sample, such that the labeled antibodies bind the analyte27when the sample passes through the first region14.

The substrate13also comprises a second region16, where capture antibodies26are deposited. The capture antibodies26are solubilized by the sample when the sample flows to and through the second region16. The capture antibodies have biotin29conjugated thereto, and are reactive to a second, different epitope on the antigen27, such that the capture antibodies26also bind to the analyte27when the analyte27passes through the second region16. The analyte27is therefore bound by both the labeled antibodies24and the capture antibodies26, forming a “sandwich” complex. The sandwich complex flows with the sample to a third region18forming a test line. The third region18has avidin28immobilized thereon. The avidin28binds to the biotin29on the capture antibodies26, thereby retaining the sandwich complex at the third region18, resulting in the accumulation of label particles25at the third region18, which provides for a visual determination of the presence of analyte27in the sample. Although this sandwich detection method has been widely used, it is also possible to immobilize the capture antibodies26at the third region18for trapping labeled antibody-antigen complexes at the third region18, and eliminating the second region16.

Labeled antibodies24that are not bound to analyte27continue to flow past the third region18to an optional fourth region20forming a control line. The fourth region20has immobilized antibodies deposited thereon which bind to the labeled antibodies (e.g. species specific antibodies). Thus, when the analyte of interest27is present in the sample, a visual signal may be detected both at the third region18and at the fourth region20. However, if the analyte27is not present in the sample, a visual signal is detected only at the fourth region20.

FIG. 1Bis a schematic representation of the binding interactions that take place at the third region18. Labeled antibodies bind to a first epitope on the analyte27in the sample. Capture antibodies26with biotin29conjugated thereon binds to a second epitope on the analyte27, forming the sandwich complex. Avidin28is immobilized on the third region18, and bind to the biotin that is conjugated to the capture antibodies26. The result is the capture of the sandwich complex, thereby providing the visual signal indicating the presence of the analyte27in the sample.

Recent efforts in the field of LFAs have focused on creating devices capable of quantitating the amount of analyte present in the sample. Such information is important, for example, when the amount of analyte in sample, rather than merely its presence, provides the required information. For example, a baseline level of analyte may be normal, but elevated analyte may be indicative of disease when it exceeds some threshold level.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Various implementations of systems, methods and devices within the scope of the appended claims each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for the desirable attributes described herein. Without limiting the scope of the appended claims, some prominent features are described herein.

Details of one or more implementations of the subject matter described in this specification are set forth in the accompanying drawings and the description below. Other features, aspects, and advantages will become apparent from the description, the drawings, and the claims. Note that the relative dimensions of the following figures may not be drawn to scale.

In one implementation, a diagnostic device for detection of analyte in a sample comprises a substrate comprising a first region comprising labeled antibodies deposited thereon, wherein the labels of the labeled antibodies comprise enteric material particles with ferrocene methanol embedded therein. The substrate also comprises a second region comprising an enzyme deposited thereon, wherein the enzyme interacts with a chemical during the detection process to cause the release of ferrocene methanol from enteric material particles located in the second region. The device also comprises a detector configured to detect released ferrocene methanol.

In another implementation, a method of making an assay device comprises mixing an enteric material with ferrocene methanol in a solvent, removing the solvent to form particles of enteric material having ferrocene methanol embedded therein, attaching antibodies to the beads by physical adsorption or other means to produce labeled antibodies, and depositing the labeled antibodies onto a first region of a substrate.

In another implementation, a label for biochemical assays comprises an enteric material particle having ferrocene methanol embedded therein.

In another implementation, a method for determining the presence and quantity of analyte in a urine sample comprises applying urine to a first region of a substrate, reconstituting labeled antibodies at a first region of the substrate with the urine, wherein the label of the labeled antibodies comprises an enteric material particle having ferrocene methanol embedded therein, solubilizing urease at a second region of the solid matrix with the urine to release ferrocene methanol into the urine from labelled antibodies trapped at the second region of the substrate, and detecting the released ferrocene methanol at the second region of the substrate.

Other aspects of the invention will become apparent by consideration of the detailed description and accompanying drawings.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed towards an aqueous lubricant composition and its method of production thereof.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Lubrication is the process or technique that reduces wear of one or both surfaces that move relative to each other in close proximity. Lubricants prevent or lessen wear and irritation between the surfaces.

Personal lubricants for intercourse are well known and are useful for providing lubricity to various parts of the body, such as mucous membranes (e.g. oral, rectal, vaginal). These compositions may be in the form of jellies, liquids, vaginal suppositories, oils or emulsions. When applied onto condoms, these lubricants also facilitate unrolling of the condom as well as preventing the surfaces of the rolled condom from sticking together as the products age in storage.

Water-based personal lubricants are water-soluble and are the most widely used personal lubricants. These lubricants are easy to clean up, non-staining to fabrics and are formulated to be nonirritating. The viscosity of these products can be altered by adjusting their water content and concentration of cellulose or other gel-forming hydrophilic ingredients. However, because water-based personal lubricants absorb into the skin and mucous membranes and evaporate, these lubricants have a tendency to dry out during use. Very often, the water-based lubricant has to be reapplied to extend the intimate activity. This is one of the chief drawbacks of water-based lubricants, since reapplication is distracting and “breaks the mood”.

To improve product lubricity, water-based lubricants are often formulated with high levels of polyhydric alcohols such as propylene glycol, glycerin or sorbitol that function as humectants. For example, the marketed K-Y® NATURAL FEELING® Liquid, which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,591 to Ahmad, et al. comprises about 30% glycerin, about 5% propylene glycol and about 10% sorbitol. In addition to polyhydric alcohols, surfactants are also added to water-based lubricants to reduce the attraction between water molecules, thereby making the lubricants more slippery and less sticky. For example, commercially available water-based lubricants of the ASTROGLIDE® series all contain surfactants such as polyquaternium-15.

Recent studies have shown that personal lubricants that contain polyhydric alcohols or surfactants may damage the vagina and rectum cell linings, potentially making the user more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (see O. Begay et al.,AIDS Research and Human retroviruses,27, 1-6, 2011; L. K. WolfC&EN90(50), 46-49, 2012). According to O. Begay, et al., the damaging effect is dependent upon osmolality of the lubricant. Osmolality is a parameter that indicates the overall concentration of the molecular ingredients in a composition. Osmolality is measured in moles (osmoles) of solute per kilogram of solvent. Mice that were exposed to lubricants with high osmolality were more susceptible to infections. Many water-based lubricants on the market have high osmolality, as they contain large amounts of ingredients such as propylene glycol, glycerin and sorbitol, which contribute to high numbers of moles of solutes per kg of solute.

A preferred type of personal lubricant is silicone-based. Silicone-based personal lubricants are very lubricious and do not dry out. Further, they are hypoallergenic, safe to use with condoms and are less damaging to cells because of their low osmolality. However, the main drawback of silicone-based lubricants is that they are greasy and can be difficult to cleanup.

To deliver the benefits of both water- and silicone-based lubricants, oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions-based lubricants have been developed and marketed. These lubricants are typically opaque or “milky” in appearance, which is caused by the difference in refractive index between the aqueous phase and the oil phase. LIQUID SILK® and SYSTEM JO® Hybrid are examples of emulsion-based personal lubricants.

To make the emulsion lubricants clear and transparent, and thus more appealing to consumers, two approaches have been taken. The first approach involves matching the refractive index between the two immiscible phases. The second approach involves the use of high concentrations of emulsifiers to form micro-emulsions. The oil droplets in the micro-emulsions are smaller than the light wavelength, thus making the emulsion appear clear. U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,848 to Ahmad, et al. discloses micro-emulsion-based lubricants, which are highly lubricious, clear and transparent. However, these micro-emulsion-based lubricants also have high levels of polyhydric alcohols (up to 45% w/w), which may harm vaginal cells.

An alternative to known water-based and silicone-based personal lubricants has been developed using hyaluronic acid (“HA”) as a lubricating component to relieve vaginal dryness. For example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2010/0284937 to Zhao, et al. teaches a vaginal lubricant comprising a high molecular weight HA and a low molecular weight component selected from low molecular weight HA and chitosan, wherein the low molecular weight component stabilizes the lubricant.

U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0143331 to Strompoulis, et al., teaches a cosmetic composition comprising at least one polysaccharide such as HA and encapsulating at least one inhibitor of degradation into the polysaccharide.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,869,270 to Uneo, et al., teaches a condom comprising a coating made from polysaccharide such as HA, wherein the coating is an aqueous solution that contains 10-70% concentration of the HA.

U.S. Patent Application No. 2011/0171286 to Cecile, et al., teaches an HA gel formulation for treating skin, comprising hyaluronic acid and at least one additional constituent selected from the group consisting of vitamin B, C and E, wherein the formulation exhibits greater stability.

However, the exemplary prior art either teaches a composition that requires a special ingredient to stabilize the HA, a high amount of HA of at least 10%, or the viscosity of the taught composition is undesirably low, causing the lubricant to be too watery and being retained poorly during contact in sexual intercourse.

Therefore, there continues to be a need for new personal lubricants that impart some of the benefits of both water-based lubricants (clear, easy to clean, non-staining) and silicone oil-based lubricants (highly lubricious, low osmolality). More specifically, there is a need for novel lubricants that match closely to the vaginal fluid to provide a natural alternative to commercially available personal lubricants. Furthermore, the lubricants should be compatible with lubricated and non-lubricated latex, polyurethane and synthetic PI condoms.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed towards an aqueous lubricant composition comprising hyaluronic acid (“HA”) as a moisturizing component and an aqueous carrier.

"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that provide user connectivity. More particularly, the test devices include elements that provide for specific feedback to the user, such as through audible means.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Some commercially available assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell or device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive a fluid sample transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single fluid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

For tests such as those described above, visually observable indicia can be preferred. Such indicia typically have included the presence of agglutination or a color change at a defined site on the assay. More recent efforts have included providing electronic (i.e., digital) signals as the observable indicia. Nevertheless, user interface with diagnostic test devices remain limited. For example, user interface disconnect can lead to user anxiety, such as in relation to uncertainty over the elapsed time between starting a test and obtaining the test result. In typical pregnancy test devices, for example, the elapsed time is typically less than five minutes. During this time, there also can be anxiety over whether the test is indeed progressing normally. For example, although some test devices include a liquid crystal display (LCD) digital readout that can display a static or blinking clock as indicia of a progressing test, such interface can be sufficiently limited so as to not meet user expectations and overcome anxiety. Another user interface disconnect can relate to user uncertainty over whether a sufficient volume of fluid sample (e.g., urine) has been applied in order for the test to progress normally and provide a valid test result. Because of these and other reasons, it would be beneficial to provide a personal use test device with improved communication between the test device and the user.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that include elements useful for carrying out an assay and for providing information related to the assay in an audible format. As an illustrative example, a pregnancy test device can be provided and can include elements for carrying out a test on a fluid sample applied to a receiving member so as to identify the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the sample that is indicative of a pregnancy status. Such test device beneficially can include further elements that enable the test device to provide a variety of audible indices relating to the operation and results of the assay. Test devices according to the present disclosure thus can provide for increased communication from the test device to a user thereof and make the test device easier for the user to operate, improve understanding of the results of the included assay, and increase user comfort with the test device and user assurance in the reliability of the test device.

In certain embodiments, a diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can comprise a test member (for example, a test strip, particularly a strip adapted for carrying out a lateral flow assay) and an electronic communication circuit adapted to provide one or more indicia of operation of the test member to a user. More specifically, the electronic communication circuit can include an audio output component. For example, the audio output component can comprise a transducer (i.e., a loudspeaker or a buzzer). The audio output component also can comprise an audio driver that can be a circuit with a built-in oscillator and that can be useful to drive the audio output from the loudspeaker or buzzer. In further embodiments, the audio output component can include an audio chip. Beneficially, the audio chip can include a memory device that is useful to increase the breadth of sounds that can be output from the audio component. Specifically, the memory device can include one or more programmed digital sequences corresponding to an output sound. In light of the variety of audio output elements that can be utilized in the present test device, a wide variety of sounds can be output from the test device. For example, the output sound can be selected from the group consisting of buzzing, a single tone, a series of tones, a melody, a synthesized word or words, a recorded word or words, and combinations thereof. If desired, the test device further can comprise a switching element adapted to enable or disable the audio output component.

In addition to the foregoing, a test device according to the present disclosure can include further components. Specifically, the electronic communication circuit of the test device further can include a microcontroller that can be adapted to signal the audio output component to provide an audible indicia of operation of the test member. Any aspect of the test device that can be adapted to audible description thereof can be relayed by the audio component of the test device under the direction of the microcontroller. As illustrative examples, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate that a defined volume of a fluid sample has been applied to a sample receiving member of the test device for the assay to be carried out. Likewise, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to provide one or more instructions for carrying out the assay. Further, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate one or more times that the assay is processing an applied liquid sample. The microcontroller also can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate that the test device has completed processing an applied fluid sample. Still further, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate a test result arising from the test having processed an applied fluid sample. Further to the foregoing examples, the audio output from the present test device need not be limited to the use and results of the test member of the test device. Any further audio output that may be desirable for delivery to a user of the test device can also be provided, particularly in embodiments that incorporate an audio chip and associated memory. For example, marketing information and the like may be communicated by the test device according to the present disclosure.

The diagnostic test device further can comprise components suitable to carry out a test initiation routine. Specifically, the components can include a signaling mechanism in communication with the microcontroller. For example, a switch or sensor may be included to provide indication that a cap of the test device has been removed or that the device has been removed from packaging material (e.g., a foil pouch) so as to ready the test device for use thereof. A defined power on button or capacitive sensing element also may be included to provide manual control for a user to turn the test device on when ready for use thereof. As such, the test device also can include a power source, such as a battery, or any similar element.

The electronic communication circuit of the test further can comprise one or more components adapted to provide input signals to the microcontroller that relate to the test. For example, the electronic communication circuit can include a light source (such as a light emitting diode) and a light sensor. Such components together can form an opto-detector. As such, the word “light” is intended to encompass the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation and is not limited to visible light. Thus, for example, ultraviolet and infrared detectors are encompassed. In further embodiments, the electronic communication circuit can include a moisture sensor for providing input signals to the microcontroller, particularly as indication that sufficient sample has been applied to the test device for the assay to proceed normally. Such various elements of the communication circuit thus are desirably positioned within the test device (i.e., within the casing) so that the elements are positioned appropriately for detecting information to be input to the microcontroller.

The diagnostic test device of the present disclosure also can include means for relaying information to a user in a manner other than audibly. For example, the electronic communication circuit can include a display. Specifically, a liquid crystal display (LCD) can be provided so as to allow for digital display of words, images, and the like. Alternatively, the display can be an analog display. Still further, the display can be simply a window in the casing of the test device that enables viewing of a defined section of the assay test strip. Additionally, the test device can include components adapted to cause vibration, and a vibration signal or vibration pattern can be utilized to indicate to a user a defined status of the test device.

As noted above, the test device of the present disclosure includes elements useful for carrying out an assay. Specifically, the test device can include a lateral flow assay that is adapted to detect the presence of an analyte in a sample applied to the assay. In addition to hCG, as noted previously, the analyte can be, for example, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or metabolites thereof, or the like. Other analytes—e.g., proteins—can also be detected by the presently disclosed test device.

The present disclosure also encompasses methods for providing one or more indicia of operation of a test to a user. In certain embodiments, the method can comprise combining, in a single casing: the test member; and an electronic communication circuit. The electronic communication circuit can include any combination of the elements otherwise disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the communication circuit can include: a microcontroller; one or more components adapted to provide input signals to the microcontroller relating to the lateral flow assay; and an audio output component. The method further can comprise programming the microcontroller to respond to a defined input signal by signaling the audio output component to emit a corresponding audio signal. Any audio signal as otherwise disclosed herein can be encompassed by the method.

BACKGROUND

Field

The embodiments disclosed herein relate to test devices and methods for assessing male fertility.

Description of the Related Art

Male fertility is generally assessed by counting the number of sperm per milliliter in a semen sample. Traditionally, this has been done manually by a trained andrologist. A semen sample is placed under a microscope, and the number of observed sperm are counted in a given area of view. This count is correlated to sample volume to produce a value for sperm per milliliter. In addition to sperm count, sperm motility is also a significant factor in assessing male fertility. A qualitative assessment of sperm motility can be made by visually evaluating the motion of the sperm in the sample under the microscope. These microscope systems are generally expensive, and can produce inconsistent results, even when used by well trained personnel.

Home use reagent based sperm count assays have been developed, such as the SpermCheck® male fertility test kit produced by ContraVac, Inc. and Princeton BioMeditech Corp. This kit can be used at home for a threshold test of sperm count. However, a numerical result for sperm count is not obtainable with this test kit, and it has no facility for assessing sperm motility.

SUMMARY

In one implementation, a male fertility assessment apparatus comprises a housing having a maximum linear dimension of no more than 100 mm and wherein the ratios of height to width, height to length, and length to width are between 0.1 and 10, and having a bright field imaging system contained within the housing. In this implementation, the bright field imaging system comprises a backlight, an optical assembly comprising a lens system having front and back focal lengths of no more than 20 mm each, and an aperture area of 1-10 mm2. The front focal length divided by the square root of the aperture area and the back focal length divided by the square root of the aperture area are each at least 5. The system also comprises a two-dimensional light sensor defining an image plane location that is fixed with respect to the position of the lens system. The apparatus further comprises a sample holder, and a sample chamber configured for placement in the sample holder to define an object plane location that is fixed with respect to the position of the lens system. The image plane position, object plane position, and front and back focal lengths define a magnification of no more than 10. The apparatus further comprises processing circuitry contained within the housing coupled to the light sensor and configured to process data received from the light sensor to assess one or more sperm characteristics, and an output coupled to the processing circuitry and configured to output data indicating one or more sperm characteristics.

In another implementation, a method of assessing male fertility comprises placing a semen sample into a sample chamber having a depth of no more than 0.05 mm, inserting the sample chamber into a sample holder positioned adjacent to a lens, illuminating the sample chamber, producing an image of the semen sample on a two-dimensional light sensor positioned on the other side of the lens from the sample chamber and no more than 50 mm from the center of the sample chamber, processing image data from the two-dimensional light sensor, and outputting an assessment of male fertility based at least in part on the processing.

In another implementation, a male fertility assessment apparatus comprises a housing, a light source in the housing, a fixed two-dimensional light sensor in the housing, a fixed sample holder in the housing defining a sample chamber position located between the light source and the fixed two-dimensional light sensor. The defined sample chamber position is no more than 50 mm from the fixed two-dimensional light sensor. The apparatus also includes one or more fixed lenses in the housing positioned between the fixed sample holder and the fixed two dimensional light sensor, and processing circuitry in the housing coupled to receive image data from the fixed two dimensional light sensor.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to containers. More particularly, the invention relates to pour spouts for containers for liquid laundry detergent and the like.

There has been an evolution in the configuration of containers for liquid laundry detergent, fabric softener, and the like. The dominant form of container is a wide mouth bottle having an attached spout with a drain-back trough and aperture. In a typical group of container configurations and their methods of assembly, a bottle, spout fitment, and cap are individually molded (e.g., of high density polyethylene (HDPE)). Exemplary bottle molding is via roto-molding whereas exemplary spout fitment and cap molding are by injection molding. An exemplary spout fitment includes the spout and a continuation of the spout defining the base and outboard wall of the trough. The fitment further typically includes a flange (e.g., extending outward at an upper end of the outboard extremity of the trough).

The spout fitment may be inserted through a mouth of the bottle (e.g., so that an outer surface of the outboard trough wall whereof another wall outboard thereof engages the inner surface of the bottle neck). The spout fitment may be secured and sealed to the bottle such as by spin welding. The bottle may be filled and the cap may be installed. Exemplary caps typically have either an externally threaded skirt for engaging an internally threaded portion of the fitment or an internally threaded skirt for engaging an externally threaded portion of the fitment or bottle neck. With a typical externally threaded skirt, the cap includes an outwardly projecting flange above the skirt. Upon installation of the cap to the fitment, the flange underside contacts and seals with the fitment flange upper surface to seal the bottle.

One recently-proposed bottle configuration is shown in US2008/0164282, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein as if set forth at length.

"BACKGROUND

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In some embodiments, methods and devices for the detection of an analyte in a body fluid using, impedance are provided.

Description of the Related Art

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of analytes in body fluids such as saliva, urine or blood. These assays typically involve antigen-antibody reactions, synthetic conjugates comprising enzymatic, fluorescent, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most of these assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) specific for the selected analyte (e.g., antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of the antigen-antibody reaction product. Although some commercially available tests are designed to a quantitative determination, in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative indication (e.g., positive/negative). Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, ovulation prediction and many types of urinalysis.

Diagnostic assays should generally be very sensitive because of the often low concentrations of analytes of interest, present in a test fluid. False positives can be problematic particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed that rely on the interaction between avidin and biotin-tagged antibodies. For example, in some commercially available pregnancy tests, an antibody-antigen sandwich complex comprising a colloidal gold-labeled anti-hCG antibody and an anti-hCG biotin-labeled antibody is used. Test strips of this nature are known in the art, and are described in more detail in, for example,FIGS. 2-6and the accompanying description of U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,676, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Other proposals have sought to exploit the changes in impedance that occur due to the presence of metal-labeled antibodies. For example, International Application Publication No. WO2013/083686, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses electrodes located on test and reference regions measuring changes in capacitance. A difference in capacitance between the test and reference regions is indicative of the presence and quantity of a bound metal and thus of the target analyte. However, in such systems the changes in the capacitance are small, and the layout thus requires precision. This requires more precise tools and other improvements to the designing, building and assembling of such devices. Thus, burdensome constraints are imposed on production, driving up costs for end users. Therefore, it is desirable to have further improvements in the design, reliability, and ease of manufacture for impedance-based assays and to provide the market with affordable test kits.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to diagnostic assays for analytes in a fluid sample. In particular, the invention relates to devices and methods for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid.

Description of the Related Art

Detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine samples is routinely used to determine a woman's pregnant/non-pregnant status. Traditional one-step pregnancy test devices detect hCG by utilizing a double antibody system in a lateral flow format resulting in a “sandwich” complex of hCG, a capture antibody and a labeled antibody, which is captured at a specific detection area on a test strip. A digital version of the pregnancy test device consists of an opto-electronic reader powered by an internal battery that measures the absorbance/reflectance of the label particles specifically captured at the detection area of the test strip and automatically subtracts any non-specific background color from an adjacent area of the test strip that is outside the detection area. The adjusted measurement of absorbance/reflectance of accumulated label particles at the detection area is processed to generate a detection determination for display as a clearly read YES+/PREGNANT or NO−/NOT PREGNANT digital result on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.

Although electronic readers provide the added convenience of eliminating the end-user step of interpreting the results of the test, a step required in traditional lateral flow devices, there is room for improvements.

The present invention relates to the field of analyte detection systems and methods, with particular applicability to predicting the timing of ovulation.

BACKGROUND

Analysis of the levels of hormone in an individual can provide important and helpful prognostic information. For example, detected hormone levels may enable an evaluation of a woman's health concerns such as fertility, pregnancy and menopause. One component in evaluating a woman's fertility status is assessing her ovulatory function. The average menstrual cycle generally lasts 28 days, during which there is a transition from the follicular phase to the luteal phase. The follicular phase of the menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstruation and is followed by a rise in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen, the latter promoting the maturation of a follicle. Once estrogen levels reach an optimal concentration and duration, the pituitary gland is prompted to release a large burst of LH secretion that significantly raises the concentration of circulating LH in blood. This rise in circulating hormone is known as LH surge. This surge in LH marks the transition to the luteal phase of the cycle, resulting in final maturation of the follicle, release of a mature oocyte from the follicle (ovulation), and corpus luteum formation. After ovulation, estrogen levels continue to rise along with an increase in progesterone levels in order to prepare the endometrium for implantation. If fertilization of the oocyte occurs, the implantation of the fertilized oocyte within the uterine endometrial lining triggers production of human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) that maintains the corpus luteum and progesterone production. However in the absence of fertilization, the corpus luteum deteriorates resulting in a decrease in the levels of both estrogen and progesterone, and sloughing of the endometrial lining thereby marking the onset of the next cycle.

In assessing ovulatory function, daily measurements of LH levels may be used to predict the timing of ovulation. The rise in blood LH may occur ˜24-36 hours prior to ovulation.

Measurements of serum progesterone levels 18 to 24 days after the onset of menses or seven days before the next cycle may be used to confirm whether ovulation had occurred. In the event of a confirmed pregnancy, serum progesterone levels may be utilized to assess nonviable pregnancies, e.g., ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). In pregnant individuals, a serum progesterone value of ≥25 ng/ml is 98% of the time associated with a viable pregnancy, while a value of <5 ng/ml identifies a nonviable pregnancy.

Another component in evaluating a woman's fertility status may be assessing the functioning potential of the ovary with respect to the quantity and quality of the oocytes within the ovary, commonly referred to as ovarian reserve. An acceleration of follicular loss is prevalent in the last 10-15 years before menopause. This loss correlates with a subtle increase in FSH. One test that may be used to assess ovarian reserve is the Day 3 FSH test. This test determines the level of FSH on cycle day three during which estrogen level is expected to be low. A cycle day three FSH level <10 IU/L is suggestive of adequate ovarian reserve, whereas an FSH level >25 IU/L is associated with a chance of pregnancy close to zero during ovulation induction.

A woman's fertility may also be affected by fluctuations in thyroid gland function. The measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may be used as a screening test. Briefly, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) prompts the pituitary gland to produce TSH. However, THR also prompts the pituitary to release more of the hormone prolactin (PRL). Elevations of PRL can interfere with ovulation by suppressing release of the hormones LH and FSH, which stimulate the ovary. Low levels of TSH may also interfere with the rate of metabolism of sex hormones, which may also cause ovulatory disorders. Menstrual irregularities and bleeding problems are common in hypothyroid women.

Diagnostic tests for screening analytes, e.g. urinary hormones or metabolites thereof, may utilize antibodies specific to the analyte. A change in the level from a predetermined threshold level may be noted by differences in color or color intensity compared with the color in a reference window or a reference guide. The color change may be produced using techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or lateral flow color matching assays to indicate the amount of analyte in a urine sample.

Improvements to the diagnostic tests for fertility monitoring have been made by removing the step which required the individual to interpret the results. In these products, electronic sensors and displays provide clear outputs indicating analyte levels. For example, the Clearblue® Easy Fertility Monitor (CBEFM) provides a method for monitoring the fertility status of an individual using two hormones: LH and estrogen with electronic reading and a digital display. The Clearblue® Digital Ovulation Test (CDOT) is another commercially available device, which employs a variable threshold for LH surge determination, and is also an improvement over the color matching visually read tests. Although both CBEFM and CDOT show improvement over the art, there still remains a need for such diagnostic devices that are affordable to the average consumer and provide simplicity of use over the prior art. Accordingly, improvements in detection systems are desirable.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed to non-irritating personal lubricant compositions with functional sensorial agents.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Personal lubricants for intimate contact are well known. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to add various functional agents to personal lubricant compositions in order to, for example, enhance pleasurable feelings during sexual activity and/or to heighten sexual arousal. Examples of such products include K-Y® Warming Liquid and Durex® Play Tingling. K-Y® Warming Liquid is a water-soluble, anhydrous composition that warms on contact while providing lubrication. Durex® Play Tingling is a water-soluble composition with a unique blend of agents that warms, cools and tingles while providing lubrication.

Using condoms containing lubricants which include sensorial agents has also been proposed. Producing such lubricated condoms is somewhat challenging, particularly if the lubricant is to be applied both on the inside and on the outside of the condom. Conventional machinery used in condom manufacture mandates that the lubricant composition have relatively tight specifications, for example, in terms of viscosity, tackiness and stringiness, as well as providing the desired degree of lubricity.

Personal lubricants comprising functional agents are designed to cause physiological or physical changes in the area to which they are applied. These functional agents range from agents that self-warm when exposed to moisture, e.g. polyols, agents that act on nerve endings to simulate a perceived sensation such as warming, cooling and/or tingling, and agents that could in sufficient quantity increase localized blood flow, e.g. vasodilators.

Self-warming lubricants are known in the art. They generate heat or warming when placed in contact with moisture on the human body, e.g. K-Y® Warming Liquid. The warming effect is created by a phenomenon known as heat of dilution; some agents when diluted with water release energy in the form of heat; e.g., polyethylene glycol. When blended with an anhydrous composition, the product upon dilution provides a slight warming effect.

Thermoreceptors belong to the class of transient receptor potential (TRP). TRP subfamily V, members 1 to 3 (TRPV1 to TRPV3) are activated by heat. TRPV4, TRP subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) and TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) are activated by cold. The cold receptor TRPA1 when activated by noxious cold produces a pain-like sensation, which paradoxically produces a human sensorial effect often described as “hot”.

Lubricants that provide a perceived sensation are also known in the art. For example, Trojan® Fire & Ice® condom comprises a lubricant composition on the condom that utilizes vanillyl butyl ether (VBE) to simulate a perceived warming sensation and menthol to simulate a perceived cooling sensation. Chemical warming agents (such as VBE) bind TRPV1 on sensory neurons. Chemical cooling agents (such as menthol) bind to TRPM8 or cold and menthol receptor 1 (CMR1).

However, some agents like VBE, menthol, vasodilators, and various natural extracts, e.g. sichuan, jambu, ginger, maca, etc., are known to be skin irritants. Such compositions have the disadvantage of causing irritation to the mucosa, which can be problematic in relation to the vaginal or oral mucosa as irritation may disrupt the sexual experience. Accordingly, there remains a need to deliver a sensory stimuli using a personal lubricant while minimizing the effect of irritation.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.
