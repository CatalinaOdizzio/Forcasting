"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to novel methods for manipulating protein and polysaccharide/starch components of food products or ingredients, and in particular cocoa-containing products, as a food ingredient and as a final food product. In one aspect, the invention encompasses a chocolate composition comprising a gel network formed by cocoa starches and/or proteins, or milk proteins and cocoa solids, and also comprising crystallized cocoa butter as a dispersed component, and water or milk or skim milk as the continuous phase or aqueous phase of a suspension. Previously, chocolate compositions employed cocoa butter as the continuous phase in compositions and suspensions, generally with sugar, milk solids and cocoa solids as the dispersed phase. Both liquid cocoa compositions and solid compositions traditionally follow this standard. The compositions, products, and ingredients possible according to the invention, however, can utilize the gel forming potential of starch and protein components of cocoa ingredients and/or other ingredients to create a wide range of oil-in-water suspensions with advantageous properties. For example, recipes for a low or reduced calorie chocolate product or ingredient having the same cocoa content as conventional chocolate and/or falling within the standard of identity for chocolate products can be designed. In addition, the production and packaging options for chocolate products are expanded by the use of the invention as the viscosity of the chocolate product or ingredient can be varied easily without specific reliance on cocoa butter content.

DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Chocolate products and ingredients conventionally exist as suspensions, with fat or oil as the continuous phase. Polymorphic crystals of cocoa butter form an important part of the fine structure of these suspensions and the methods to control crystallization of cocoa butter are well known. In general, the setting of cocoa butter crystals into the most stable form is desirable. The failure to account for the difference in forms within the fat suspension can result in poor color and blooming.

From a production point of view, cocoa butter content has been changed to vary the viscosity of chocolate compositions, so that higher cocoa butter content results in a more viscous final product or ingredient. While heating may be used to increase flowability or solubility of certain ingredients in chocolate processing or packaging, heating is not used as a method to change the properties of cocoa-containing compositions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a food product or ingredient having a crystallized and gelatinized structure in an oil-in-water suspension. The combination of a gelatinized structure, a crystallized structure, and an oil-in-water suspension made possible and demonstrated by the methods, food products and ingredients of the invention provide numerous advantages in the food processing field. For example, the invention provides products with improved viscosity characteristics over a greater range of temperatures and allows sugar free or low or reduced calorie products to be produced while maintaining other desirable characteristics, such as texture, taste, mouthfeel, and viscosity. Furthermore, the invention can be said to incorporate methods and ingredients, or more particularly moisture levels, that standard practices report as inappropriate or undesirable in the chocolate manufacturing field. For example, Beckett (Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use, 3d Ed., Beckett ed., 1999 Blackwell Science Ltd., see Chaps. 9 and 20 in particular) notes that it is necessary to remove moisture during processing of chocolate to avoid the requirement to use additional fat and to avoid or minimize the possibility of microbial growth. In addition, Minifie (Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d Ed., 1999, Aspen Publishing, see Chap. 5 in particular) notes the importance of minimizing the introduction of water in chocolate processing in order to maintain a desired viscosity. Thus, in one aspect, by using water or water-based solutions as the aqueous phase in an oil-in-water solution for cocoa and/or chocolate food ingredients or products, the invention utilizes counter-intuitive methods and ingredients as compared to typical chocolate product and ingredient manufacturing.

In one embodiment, the food ingredient comprises an oil or fat phase comprising at least about 2% or at least about 3% cocoa solids and at least about 2% or at least about 3% cocoa butter, the cocoa solids being in suspension and/or at least partially crystallized in the final ingredient or product at room temperature. In various embodiments involving cocoa or chocolate, the cocoa butter and cocoa solids content from one or more of a variety of added cocoa-containing products can be selected to generate a range of final weight percent values, including from about 2% to about 3% cocoa butter, about 3% to about 5% cocoa butter, about 5% to 10% or higher cocoa butter, and about 2% to about 3% cocoa solids, about 3% to about 5% cocoa solids, and about 5% to 10% or higher cocoa solids, and any combination of these ranges. In one aspect, the invention does not encompass prior or conventional chocolate milk mixtures that do not possess or are not treated to generate a gelatinized and/or oil-in-water suspension as described here. Generally, prior chocolate milk mixtures do not form stable suspensions, as one of skill in the art understands.

The food ingredients or products of the invention or used in the invention are not limited to any particular state or temperature, for example room temperature. The reference to crystallized or partially crystallized structures at room temperature means the food ingredient or product is capable of exhibiting a crystallized or partially crystallized structure or microstructure when at room temperature. Thus, in part, the suspension has a crystallized structure. The food ingredient further comprises an aqueous phase comprising water or milk or skim milk, such as a composition of at least about 5% milk solids and at least about 5% nutritive carbohydrate sweetener. The soluble starches or polysaccharides and protein present in at least the cocoa solids, or other cocoa product, are capable of forming a gel network in the suspension. Thus, in part, the suspension has a gelatinized structure. The insoluble particles from at least the cocoa, such as the cocoa cell wall materials, are dispersed within the gel network forming part of the suspension. While cocoa-containing compositions are routinely referred to, the invention is not limited to cocoa-containing compositions. Other food ingredients or edible compositions can be used.

In a specific embodiment, the food ingredient of the invention has at least about 15%, or at least about 18%, or at least about 20% cocoa solids by weight in its final ingredient form or product form. Thus, the methods and ingredients and products of the invention can be used in the production of various chocolate products that fall within the standard of identity for chocolate, milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, and white chocolate that may exist in a desired market or under a particular regulatory setting. Furthermore, artificial or non-nutritive sweeteners can be used in conjunction with the invention to produce low calorie or low carbohydrate products or sugar free products. Also, vitamin and/or mineral food additives can be optionally added to improve the nutritional content of chocolate or cocoa-containing foods, for example.

In another aspect, the invention comprises a method of making a food ingredient where a fat or oil phase composition comprising cocoa butter, milk fat and/or other edible fat, and optionally an emulsifier, is mixed with an aqueous or continuous phase comprising water or milk. The mixing can be performed by a variety of methods known to the food and food ingredient industries, and specifically includes homogenizer, dynamic mixer, or static mixer processes. After preparing the oil-in-water suspension, the mixture of the oil or fat phase with the aqueous or continuous phase can be heated under conditions where the protein and starch components of the cocoa solids produce a gel network. In general terms, the gel network is functionally a gelatinized composition having an increased viscosity compared to its pre-treatment or pre-heated form. It can be prepared from biopolymer-containing components, such as protein and/or carbohydrate containing components, particularly cocoa products such as cocoa solids and milk products such as milk solids. One of skill in the art is familiar with methods and equipment for measuring the viscosity of compositions, including the compositions noted here. Without limiting the invention to any particular mechanism, the protein and/or soluble carbohydrate or starch components in a composition of food ingredients, such as a cocoa-containing composition, can be effectively swelled or water-saturated by particular treatments or heating processes depending on the components of the composition. In preferred treatments, the gel network formation occurs efficiently by heating to a range between about 52° C. to about 68° C. for cocoa-containing compositions. Gel network formation in the same cocoa-containing compositions can also occur through prolonged standing, with or without mechanical shearing. Functionally, the treating or heating step should disrupt the native protein conformation and/or swell carbohydrate or starch or biopolymer components from their existing state in order to form a gel network. Since the swelling of cocoa product components can take long periods of time and/or employ mechanical treatments, the preferred method of preparing a gel network according to this invention is by heating.

In the photomicrographs ofFIGS. 5 and 6, one can see the difference between the treated or heated cocoa components and the same components after conventional cocoa processing. In general, the methods of the invention allow for a microstructure of cocoa-containing compositions or suspensions where the cocoa butter droplets can be from about 0.5 to about 100 microns in diameter, or more preferably about 0.5 to about 30 microns in diameter. Furthermore, the carbohydrate or starch components of the cocoa products used or the cell components from the cocoa products used are visibly swelled in the methods and products of the invention (seeFIG. 6), while in the conventional dark chocolate composition ofFIG. 5, by comparison, they are typically present as crystallized and/or amorphous components in the suspension. In addition, the sugar in the suspension ofFIG. 6is dissolved in the continuous phase rather than in crystalline structures as shown in the conventional composition ofFIG. 5, thus leading to a more uniform and smoother texture.

In another aspect, the invention provides a novel oil-in-water suspension at temperatures below the melting point of the cocoa butter in a cocoa butter containing composition. In this and other aspects of the invention, cocoa butter is discussed as part of the fat or oil phase. However, other cocoa containing products can be used, such as cocoa liquor or cocoa powder. In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with adding emulsifiers and/or hydrocolloids and/or other biopolymers to cocoa products, and emulsifiers and hydrocolloids and protein and starch compositions can optionally be added or replaced by cocoa butter in the food ingredients, products and compositions of the invention. Beyond cocoa butter or other cocoa products, additional fat components can be added in the methods to produce the food ingredients or products of the invention, especially including those with a melting point above room temperature or at or above about 25° C. or at or above about 35° C. As shown below, fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil, or cocoa butter substitute, for example, can be used as an edible oil with a melting point above room temperature.

In particular aspects, the invention includes processing a food ingredient into a processed product or composition. The processed products or compositions can be prepared by any method of the food and confectionary industry. For example, in-process steps can include adding components, such as adding vitamins, minerals, food grade gas, and one or more of the variety of ingredients available. Processing can also or in addition involve producing a marketable food product by coating, forming, molding, extruding, enrobing, injecting, baking, freezing, packaging, layering, rolling, cutting, depositing, panning, casting, or any other available method (see, for example, Minifie, “Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery,” 3d ed., Aspen Publishers). Additionally, filtration or separation processes can be included to, for example, remove substantially all insoluble particles from an ingredient or food product.

As noted above, the preferred process for forming a gel network is heating. For the cocoa product containing compositions, heating the mixed oil and aqueous phases can comprise heating to about 121° C. for about 8.5 minutes, or to about 150° C. for at least about 4 seconds, or simply heating to about 68° C. for a period of time sufficient to form a gel network. In general, for cocoa containing products, cocoa starch can be formed into a gel network if it is subjected to a temperature of about 52° C. to about 68° C., so any heating process that results in the cocoa starch reaching this temperature should suffice. Other, lower temperatures can also be selected and used if longer periods of time are employed. The higher temperatures noted here can be used in optional processing methods or optional sterilizing methods. Other methods include allowing the mixture to rest at room temperature for a period of time sufficient to form a gel network, or using high shear conditions, for example with a high pressure homogenizer.

In some of the many possible food products that can be produced, the food ingredient of the invention can be further processed into a product containing milk chocolate, sweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, or white chocolate. In addition, the product can comprise one or more of chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, heavy cream, anhydrous milk fat, whey protein concentrates, non-fat milk protein, whole milk powder, sugar, lecithin, vanillin, and skim milk, as shown in the examples below.

In a more general aspect, the invention involves preparing an oil-in-water suspension using one or more cocoa containing products. The cocoa containing products are those processed from, or some degree of processed form of, the cacao bean that are commonly available. As noted above, certain microstructure environments can be created using the protein and starch components from the cacao bean products. While the production of oil-in-water emulsions in chemical processes is not new, the use of oil-in-water suspensions for cocoa containing products in particular, and food products more generally, is not common. In addition, the use of oil-in-water suspensions for chocolate products falling under one or more of the many standards or identity for these products has not been described previously. In another general aspect, the invention comprises preparing an edible gelatinized and crystallized microstructure within an oil-in-water suspension by using a gel network forming biopolymer containing product, such as a cocoa product, a fruit product, a berry product, or a vegetable product. A gel network-forming amount of a biopolymer is used and the suspension comprises an aqueous phase and a dispersed oil or fat phase, wherein the gel network is capable of being formed from the biopolymer after heating the suspension, and the components of the oil or fat phase are at least partially crystallized at room temperature and stably present in the suspension. By the phrase “stably present in suspension,” the components of the suspension remain substantially in suspension for a period of up to 3 months, or up to 6 months, or up to 8 months, or up to 12 months, or up to 18 months, or up to 24 months or longer. The microstructures of the dispersed phase can be selected to have a size of about 100 um or less in diameter while in the suspension. The food ingredient made from these suspensions can have a biopolymer originally provided in the form of a cocoa containing product, a fruit containing product, a berry containing product, or other similar product, or even a hydrocolloid containing product. This food ingredient can also or alternatively comprise a component in the oil or fat phase that is at least partially crystallized at room temperature and can be selected from one of more of cocoa butter, fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil, 17-sterine, cocoa butter substitutes or equivalents, milk fat, or any oil or fat that is at least partially solid or crystallized at room temperature, or about 20° C., or about 25° C., or about 30° C. In addition, the invention specifically includes a final food product that comprises any of the food ingredients noted or any food ingredient produced by a method noted throughout this disclosure.

As discussed here, the oil-in-water suspension refers to a suspension of, for example, oil droplets and/or insoluble particles in a continuous medium or phase, whereas in an emulsion, by contrast, all components are dissolved in the continuous phase. In general for the food rheology field, a suspension is at least one solid dispersed within a continuous phase, where the continuous phase is at least one liquid (see, for example, Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, D. Van Nostrand Co., Inc., Princeton, N.J., 4thed. 1968, pp. 620 and 1782; Rheologie der Lebensmittel, Weipert/Tscheuschner/Windhab, Behr's Verlag, Hamburg, Germany, 1993, pp. 108 and 122). The edible oil-in-water suspension of this invention refers to a dispersed phase of oil droplets and insoluble particles that are suspended in a substantially stably manner within an aqueous continuous phase, whereas in an emulsion all of the dispersed phase components must be liquid and are merely mixed in the continuous phase and are not, generally, stably suspended. Furthermore, emulsions do not necessarily employ the gel network as mentioned here. In fact, there are no reports of cocoa-based gel networks used to produce edible oil-in-water suspensions as described here. Thus, in general, the suspensions of the inventions comprise a dispersion of crystalline and/or non-soluble droplets and/or particles dispersed in a gel network or gelatinized continuous aqueous phase. While cocoa-based oil-in-water suspensions are noted as a preferred embodiment, other biopolymer-containing compositions can be used also.

In one aspect of a method of producing a cocoa-based oil-in-water suspension, the method involves mixing a fat phase comprising one or more cocoa products, including cocoa butter, and having cocoa protein and/or starch or carbohydrate components, with an aqueous phase. In preferred embodiments, the final non-fat cocoa solids content is at least about 2% or about 3% or about 4% or more by weight of the final suspension. Also in preferred embodiments, the aqueous phase comprises water, a sugar or sweetener or both, and/or milk and/or skim milk and/or cream. Other liquids or solutions can also be used as the aqueous phase and the invention specifically includes chocolate or cocoa compositions prepared without milk or milk products, even chocolate or cocoa beverages without milk. Once mixed, a swelling or heating step occurs to form a gel network comprised of cocoa proteins and cocoa starch components. The formation of a gel network can be detected by a variety of methods known in the art, including microscopy, direct viscosity measurements, ultrasonic methods, and light scattering methods. If a viscosity measurement is used, one preferred detectable change is where the viscosity of the suspension increases after heating when measured as shear rate. More particularly, the viscosity increase is at least about two-fold or double in the measurable 30 sec-1 shear rate. If microscopy is used, one of skill in the art can measure gel formation by the effects on the final suspension and the appearance of component parts within the suspension. For example, starch granules in cocoa-containing compositions can be visualized prior to swelling and after gelatinization, and cocoa butter droplets can be visualized in the suspension at about room temperature in the range of between 0.5-100 um, or between 0.5-30 um.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention generally relates to hand-held containers and, more particularly, to hand-held containers having a discretely and slideably positionable cover.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Handheld containers are typically used for storing consumable and non-consumable items such as, for example, pills, candies, and the like. There are many different varieties and types of handheld containers. While many have been satisfactory for one purpose or another, there is always a desire for further options, features, and improvements in the art to which the present invention is directed.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

One aspect of the present invention is directed toward a practical container with mating tracks between a plastic container base and sides of a plastic container lid. The container includes a plastic container base, a plastic container lid, a pair of first tracks, and a pair of second tracks. The plastic container base has a bottom, front and back ends extending upwardly from the bottom in spaced relation, and a pair of sidewalls extending upwardly from the bottom and transversely between the front and back ends to define a storage area. The plastic container lid is slideably disposed on the plastic container base and includes a cover portion that encloses the storage area when the plastic container is in a closed position. One of the pair of first tracks are included on each of the sidewalls. The pair of second tracks depend downwardly from opposing sides of the cover portion. The pair of second tracks also slideably engage the pair of first tracks such that the plastic container lid is slideable from the closed position to an open position to form a dispensing opening between the front end of the plastic container base and a forward edge of the cover portion.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed toward a practical container with a plastic container lid that slides between defined, discrete positions. The container provides container comprising a plastic container base, a plastic container lid, and a stop mechanism. The plastic container base has a bottom, front and back ends extending upwardly from the bottom in spaced relation, and a pair of sidewalls extending upwardly from the bottom and transversely between the front and back ends to define a storage area. The plastic container lid is slideably disposed on the plastic container base and movable between closed and open positions. The plastic container lid also includes a cover portion that encloses the storage area in the closed position. The plastic container lid further forms a dispensing opening when slid from the closed position to the open position. The stop mechanism comprises cooperating components respectively arranged on the plastic container base and the plastic container lid. The cooperating components includes a plurality of detents and a resilient catch. The resilient catch engages the detents to define different discrete positions of the closed and open positions between the container lid and the container base.

Another aspect of the present invention is directed toward a container with a slide mechanism and a stopping means combination. The container comprises a plastic container base, a plastic container lid, and means for stopping the container lid. The plastic container base has a bottom, front and back ends extending upwardly from the bottom in spaced relation, and a pair of sidewalls extending upwardly from the bottom and transversely between the front and back ends to define a storage area. The plastic container lid is slideably disposed on the plastic container base and movable between closed and open positions. The plastic container lid also includes a cover portion that encloses the storage area in the closed position. The plastic container lid is further movable from the closed position to provide a dispensing opening.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to a calcium fortified syrup, and more particularly, to a syrup fortified with micronized calcium, especially micronized tricalcium phosphate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Calcium is essential for building and maintaining bone strength, nerve transmission to the muscles, serving as a catalyst for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and activating a number of enzymes including lipase. Calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis in the elderly. Additionally, protection against high blood pressure and colon cancer have been attributed to calcium. The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance, commonly referred to as the Reference Daily Intake (“RDI”), of calcium is 1000 mg for adults and children 12 or more years of age.

Calcium and other minerals and vitamins have been used to fortify foods to obtain general health benefits. To get enough calcium for growing bones, the percent Daily Value for calcium should add up to 120 percent. Foods fortified with calcium are considered to offer the same net effect as calcium naturally found in food.

Dairy products are recognized as a rich source of dietary calcium. Both milk and ice cream have been fortified with calcium. Calcium fortification of milk is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,871,123, 4,701,329, 4,840,814 and 4,851,243; see also Anon, Boosting Milk's Calcium, 99 Dairy Foods 36, 1998. For example, milk has been fortified with calcium carbonate, calcium gluconate and milk calcium in powdered form.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,779 to Mehansho describes addition of calcium to dry chocolate powers such as cocoa. Carrageenan gum has been used for suspension of calcium carbonate. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,701,329 and 4,851,243 disclose calcium-enriched and phosphorus-enriched fortified milk by the addition of tri-basic calcium phosphate, carrageenan and guar gum to milk. The hydration of the gums is necessary to assure uniform distribution of the added materials in the milk.

However, there are many obstacles associated with adding calcium to syrups that make it very difficult to utilize. For example, when added directly to syrup as a salt without being subjected to any further treatment, many of the calcium salts, which are insoluble or substantially insoluble at around neutral pH, e.g., calcium carbonate, calcium phosphates, calcium citrate and other organic or inorganic acid salts of calcium, precipitate out of the syrup or impart to the syrup a gritty chalky mouthfeel. Fortification with calcium is a significant challenge, especially in foods, such as syrups, which are ingested in small serving sizes. Syrups are packaged in standard 24 ounce bottles which include approximately 16 servings per bottle. The smaller serving size and the higher number of servings in a container for syrups is a problem since a high concentration of calcium is necessary in the small volume if it is being used to fortify this food. Also problematic is the availability of calcium from various salt ingredients. Typically, the amount of calcium in various salt forms only ranges from 20-40% based on the source.

An additional problem with calcium fortification is that most calcium sources, such as calcium carbonate, have a very poor solubility in water or in neutral pH solutions. Calcium that is very soluble in orange juice, for example, will not be soluble in chocolate syrup. Syrups are typically low water mixtures, that is, there is not a lot of available water. This poor solubility coupled with low water availability in syrups prevents calcium from becoming soluble in the system. When incorporating calcium into liquids, the source of calcium is usually in finely divided form which further promotes precipitation thereof upon extended storage.

Syrups are products which typically are expected to have much longer shelf lives than products such as milk or yogurt. The addition of untreated calcium salts to syrups causes the syrup to have a gritty texture; moreover sedimentation of calcium on the bottom of the container is likely to occur during processing and/or shelf life. More soluble calcium salts or even the use of suspended sources of calcium tends to result in off flavors, adverse appearance, and undesirable increases in viscosity. Generally, the more soluble the salt or the more finely divided it is so as to improve supendability, the quicker or more easily the off-taste will be detected. Also, solubilization of the calcium increases the likelihood of it being complexed with or interacting with other components of the syrup or other foods consumed with it. Additionally, complexation or interaction of the calcium may result in it being less susceptible to absorption in the blood.

Therefore, there is a need for a calcium fortified syrup which is flavor neutral and not unpleasant tasting or gritty and from which the calcium does not separate out.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It is an object of the present invention to fortify syrup with calcium.

It is also an object of the present invention to fortify syrup product with calcium, with a high concentrations of calcium so that one serving provides at least 10% of the RDI while maintaining a calcium suspension and preventing and/or retarding separation of calcium therefrom.

It is yet another object of the present invention to fortify syrup with calcium where the calcium is flavor neutral and is not unpleasant tasting or gritty.

Fortification of syrup with calcium is advantageous. Syrup is consumed with milk or ice cream. Research shows that the Vitamin D in milk greatly aids the bioavailability and absorption of calcium in the body. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to have synergistic absorption of calcium from a syrup consumed together with a dairy product.

Other objects, features, advantages of the invention shall become apparent as the description thereof proceeds when considered in connection with the accompanying examples.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to new beverage products made from steeping cocoa with water. The beverages can be produced as a ready-to-drink product, a concentrate, or as a mix or packet for steeping cocoa to produce a beverage. In advantageous embodiments, the beverages can be produced as a tea-type drink and may optionally contain healthy ingredients in addition to the beneficial cocoa antioxidants. In other advantageous aspects, the methods permit effective filtering and processing of a cocoa/water mixture as well as options to reduce or substantially reduce the appearance of a surface fat ring, or cocoa fat ring, commonly present in the beverage containers of fat-containing compositions upon storage.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

A variety of cocoa beverages have been available. Almost exclusively, however, these products employ a milk or liquor base to dissolve the cocoa or maintain the cocoa in solution. Immediate examples include chocolate milk and cocoa liquors. However, as more and more evidence shows the benefit of cocoa antioxidants or cocoa polyphenol compounds, a variety of food products with these compounds are desirable. The invention, in one aspect, addresses this desire by combining conventional tea steeping processes with cocoa polyphenol-containing products or extracts to produce a refreshing cocoa beverage. In another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of filtering a mixture of a cocoa product and water or aqueous solution, as prior methods were prone to clogging and inefficiencies that prevent commercial production.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to beverages made from steeped cocoa, such as cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa powder, or other cacao bean compositions. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a method for producing a refreshing beverage containing cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, and which in certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or is a low calorie beverage. The beverage can be sealed in a container for commercial distribution and be capable of stable storage for more than one month at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. A variety of filtering, irradiating, heating, centrifugation, or treatment methods, or a combination of these, can be used to produce a beverage capable of stable storage over a period of time. Other similar or compatible methods known or available in the art can also be used.

The method for producing the beverage can include the use of purified or sterilized water at certain temperatures, or a number of desired temperatures or ranges in temperature. However, any potable water or even flavored water can be used. Filtering or purifying methods to remove insoluble components, or most of or substantially all of the insoluble components can be used, as known in the art. Preferred water includes carbon filtered water, deionized water and/or water purified by reverse osmosis. In addition, aqueous solutions can be used, such as buffered aqueous solutions of citric acid, more preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% citric acid, or about 0.4% to about 0.7%, or about 0.6% citric acid at about pH 4 or below, or between about pH 3 to about pH 4. An aqueous solution prepared from water previously mixed with cocoa nibs can also be used. The use of this cocoa nib-treated water can provide additional cocoa flavoring, and the cocoa nib-treated water can also be free of fat and/or substantially free of calories. After steeping the water or aqueous solution with the cocoa product, the water is treated or filtered or purified to produce a ready-to-drink beverage or a cocoa water composition. The cocoa water composition or beverage can optionally be concentrated by methods known in the art, and then used by adding water and optionally sweeteners and/or flavorings to produce a ready-to-drink product.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. In a similar aspect, the invention includes methods to produce a cocoa water composition, and the compositions themselves, whereby the propensity to form a fat ring on a storage container of the cocoa water or a final product is substantially reduced or minimized. In particular, the invention includes the use of acidifying conditions or low pH buffering additives, such as citric acid, lactic acid and/or phosphoric acid compounds or combinations, used at one or more steps in the production process. Preferably, a pH of about 3.5 or below can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring on the container after storage. Filtration steps, filter aids, centrifugation steps, and settling time, all at selected or different temperatures, can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring. Additionally, the use of low fat cocoa powder, with about 1.2% fat, can reduce the appearance of a fat ring. In general, low fat cocoa powder contains lees than 10% cocoa butter, and defatted cocoa powder contains less than 2% cocoa butter. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The products and the methods of the invention can, in any embodiment, also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Beverage emulsifiers, beverage stabilizers, weighting agents, thickeners can also be added, and a preferred group is polysorbates, carrageenans, Tween 60, Tween 80, and gum arabic. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

In another aspect, the invention comprises packets for steeping cocoa extracts or products to produce a cocoa beverage. The packets can be similar to tea bags and can be submerged in water for steeping, as desired. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention can be made into individualized packets produced and sized to accommodate a mix or composition for producing a beverage when placed in water or other liquid. A number of other consumable products and mixes can be devised by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Preferably, the methods and products use natural cocoa or extracts that are not treated with alkaline, a process also known as “Dutching.” However, as noted, a variety of cocoa powders, cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa compositions, and cacao bean compositions are known and available to one of skill in the art and can be selected for use in any aspect of the invention. In addition, extracts with enhanced levels of cocoa polyphenols or cocoa flavanols, or extracts with additives, can also be selected for use. Furthermore, combinations of cocoa powders, extracts, enhanced extracts, concentrates, extracts with additives can be selected and used for any aspect of the invention. The terms “cocoa extract” and “cocoa bean composition” for steeping, thus, can be any of a variety of products and combinations as well as specific combinations of the cacao bean-derived products noted in this disclosure.

In particularly preferred embodiments, the invention comprises beverages that contain efficacious cocoa-polyphenols and/or cocoa antioxidants. These beverages can be used in a healthy diet, for example a diet to improve cardiovascular conditions or prevent cardiovascular disease. Another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage composition that is a sugar-free and/or calorie-free cocoa beverage. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage that is sugar-free and/or calorie-free and optionally contains other available or known supplements, active ingredients, appetite suppressing agents, and similar agents or ingredients, especially those also found in antioxidant-containing foods, herbs, teas, coffees, or food product ingredients. Further, the beverage or packet composition may also or in addition be combined with one or more other dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc., to provide a nutritional or dietary supplement. Any of these combinations of the invention can advantageously provide benefits to human health and capture additional beneficial effects. Also, all of the ingredients or combinations may be combined with appropriate stabilizers, preservatives, binders, emulsifiers, weighting agents, and other edible or ingestible compounds known to one of skill in the art in the industry to produce a packet or beverage.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. The products and the methods of the invention can also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to food products and ingredients that comprise combinations of compounds that alone and together can measurably enhance reported levels of mental energy, cognitive focus, and/or physical energy and especially during physical exercise or activity, such as during a sporting activity. The health bars, ingredients and products of the invention are heat-resistant, easily portable, and conveniently consumable. In preferred embodiments, the invention encompasses a health bar that contains high levels of cocoa, is shelf stable, and consumable before or during physical activity, as well as methods to make and effectively administer the health bars. As shown below, administration of exemplary health bars improves an athlete's score on several different performance related criteria.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Energy bars or drinks have been suggested for use by athletes that generally contain caffeine and sugars to stimulate or sustain alertness. High-protein bars have also been formulated for those attempting to gain muscle mass and strength. In addition, vitamin and other supplements are used in certain diets, again for specific conditions or consumers. The bars or supplements are not typically presented for use by the average consumer to increase mental and physical energy. Furthermore, refrigeration or cold storage is often not available for use during a sporting event. Thus the ideal health bar for consumption during a sporting event would be resistant to heat.

The combination of ingredients in the previously discussed bars or drinks, often including vitamins and other supplements, generally render them difficult to process into a stable bar format and not especially appetizing. The high protein levels can also absorb water, creating shelf stability problems. Furthermore, these products do not use cocoa as a healthful ingredient, but merely as part of a chocolate flavor, which generally employs only low levels of cocoa, necessarily delivering only low levels of cocoa anti-oxidants, below the minimal levels associated with healthful benefits.

From these deficiencies alone, one can conclude that new and improved methods for producing health bars and food ingredients with high levels of beneficial cocoa ingredients are needed.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the invention relates to the use of cocoa in novel bars, food ingredients or compositions to provide mental and physical energy or to improve performance or well-being during physical and/or mental stress, such as competitive athletic events. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods to produce health bars and compositions to generate a shelf stable, heat stable, and appetizing food product, as well as the food products themselves. In preferred aspects, the bars can contain specific ranges of available energy from carbohydrates/protein/fats, as recommended in certain diets or for certain populations. While high levels of cocoa, such as natural cocoa powder, cocoa liquor, or other cocoa solids-containing ingredients, are generally avoided in health bar-type products because of the astringent taste properties associated with cocoa, the bars of the invention can be made with acceptable and pleasant taste profiles even with high levels of natural cocoa. For example, over 20% or 25% or up to about 30% or even about 35% natural cocoa powder can be used in the health bars or food ingredients of the invention.

Thus, it is one object of the invention to provide a good tasting, chocolate-like product with a stable chewy and/or fudge-like texture that can deliver high levels of cocoa solids per standard serving of product. In particularly preferred embodiments, low-fat or non-fat cocoa solids are used as the cocoa product or one of the cocoa-containing products present. The concentrated level of cocoa solids used makes it possible for one to deliver high levels of cocoa anti-oxidant or polyphenol compounds, which have been shown to provide specific health benefits.

In another aspect, the invention involves the use of, and method of producing, a unique solid matrix for a health bar or composition in conjunction with high levels of cocoa or low to non-fat cocoa solids, and at levels similar to high cacao-containing standard chocolates and dark chocolate bars (typically 35%-70% or more cacao). In preferred embodiments, these high levels of cacao are achieved in a matrix that is at least 50% lower in fat and about 20% lower in calories than standard dark chocolate bars. The products and methods of the invention, and perhaps in particular the increased level of cocoa powder used, also provides superior heat resistance, such that the product can withstand temperatures in excess of 120 degrees F. without melting or becoming messy and undesirable for consumer handling. Furthermore, the characteristics of the high cacao compositions of the invention unexpectedly produce extrudable and rollable compositions without added water or required drying times, meaning the methods of the invention can be incorporated into a continuous process stream rather than a time-consuming, batch processing method as previously used. Conventional methods with the levels of cocoa as used herein, such as with the added cocoa powder, result in clumping and unflowable mixtures. In addition, the heat-resistant compositions do not require high levels of added starches or polyols to stabilize them.

The invention provides, in one aspect, a method of improving energy level in a subject by administering a heat-resistant, consumable cocoa anti-oxidant containing composition having about 8 grams or more of cocoa powder per dose, or the equivalent in cocoa solids, and given approximately one hour before and/or during physical activity. The amount of cocoa powder or equivalent can vary, as noted above, but a preferred range is about 8 to about 12 grams per serving or dose, or about 10 grams per serving or dose. In other embodiments, especially those involving methods to deliver certain amounts or high levels of cocoa or cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols per day, for example above 20 grams cocoa, or about 36 grams cocoa powder or its equivalent per day, and optionally over a sustain period of daily or multiple times per day treatment. Available or suggested regimens for a variety of health benefits or prophylactic treatments have been reported in the field, and the products, ingredients and methods of the invention can be useful in delivering, for example, about 20 to about 30 grams of cocoa powder or its equivalent per day, or about 30 to about 40 grams, or about 40 to about 50 grams, of even more than 50 grams of cocoa powder or its equivalent per day. The amount of cocoa present in a serving size or per gram can also be very high by the use of the invention, such as about 15 to about 20 or about 30 grams per serving size. Accordingly, multiple bars can be taken per day to deliver a desired amount of cocoa powder, its equivalent, or a desired amount of cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols per day, such as about 24 grams per day or about 75 grams per day of cocoa powder. Such administration regimens can have benefits in addition to the improved mental and physical energy effects noted here, such as improved cardiovascular condition or an improvement in the risk factors associated with cardiovascular or atherosclerotic conditions. The beneficial effects of cocoa antioxidants and polyphenols are known in the art, and the invention specifically includes the use of the products, bars, and ingredients to administer desired doses of cocoa or cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols, or any other specific compound naturally found in cocoa beans or nibs, to a person or animal. The amount of other foods consumed just before and during physical activity can be limited in order to maximize the energy-delivering effect, or minimize interference with the effect. When administered prior to or during physical activity, the effect on reported energy levels can be measured during and after the physical activity through standard means available in the art. In particular, questionnaires or other sampling of subjects to record physical energy levels, mental energy levels, ability to focus or concentrate on activity, or exhaustion or fatigue can be collected, and this data can be compared to controls where no cocoa solids or lower levels of cocoa solids are administered.

In another aspect, the invention provides a convenient health bar matrix capable of containing high levels of cocoa powder or cocoa solids, and which is specifically designed for use consistent with outdoor or physical activity. Thus, in one aspect, the health bar matrix is heat-resistant and shelf stable for at least about one month, or at least about 3 months, or at least about 6 months, or at least about 9 months, or about 12 months.

In yet another aspect, the invention provides a consumable composition, such as a chocolate bar, an energy bar, or food ingredient, that comprises about 20% or more cocoa solids and about 20% fat or less. Preferred ranges include about 20% to about 28% cocoa solids, and about 10% to about 20% fat. The cocoa solids can be provided in one or more available cocoa products produced from the cacao bean, such as cocoa powder or cocoa liquor. Various sources of cacao bean products are available and any one or any combination can be selected. In particular, the cacao bean source for a cocoa powder can be selected from one or more of unroasted cacao beans, unfermented cacao beans, medium roasted cacao beans, highly roasted cacao beans, blanched cacao beans, washed cacao beans, cacao beans selected for enhanced levels of polyphenols or particular polyphenol compounds, and extracts or any of these. Low fat or defatted cocoa products, such as defatted cocoa powder or low fat cocoa powder, enzyme treated cocoa powders (soluble cocoa) can also be used, and any of the above cacao beans can be prepared as a low fat or defatted cocoa product for use. In addition, any combination of these cacao bean products can be used. A preferred source of cocoa solids for taste is natural cocoa powder, meaning fermented, medium to high roast cocoa that is not dutched or alkaline processed. In addition, natural cocoa powder can be supplemented with cocoa extract, powder, or other products produced from an unfermented source of beans or other beans produced to have higher levels of cocoa flavanols, as well as other similar polyphenol-containing products available in the art. Natural cocoa powder supplemented with about 2%, or about 5%, or about 7%, or about 10% by weight cocoa powder or cocoa extract having these high levels of cocoa flavanols.

In a more particular aspect, the invention provides an energy bar or food ingredient for consumption during physical activity, or compatible with packaging and storage and use conditions for outdoor or physical activity, comprising an amount of cocoa product equivalent to about 23% or more cocoa solids in the final product, about 20% total fat or less, about 0.5% or less of a carrageenan or mixture of carrageenans, and sugar or mixture of sugars.

"BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention is directed to a chewing gum which provides instantaneous cooling and immediate intense sweetness and a process of making that composition. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a chewing gum which includes a solid whose surface is sanded with crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution.

2. Background of the Prior Art

One of the sweeteners employed in the manufacture of chewing gums is xylitol. Xylitol, although a non-cariogenic sweetener, leaves little unfavorable aftertaste and simulates the texture and chewing characteristics of conventional cariogenic chewing gums. As taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,899,593 and 3,914,434, xylitol not only possesses non-cariogenic properties but has substantially the same sweetening power as conventional cariogenic-producing sugars. Moreover, xylitol is highly soluble in water and possesses a relatively large negative heat of solution and is thus capable of producing significant cooling effects in the mouth.

A recent development in the chewing gum arts has been the development of chewing gums which impart intense cooling flavor upon initial contact in the mouth. To effectuate this feeling compounds well known for their physiological cooling effect on the skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth have been employed in such chewing gums. A particularly favored compound in this application is menthol. Menthol and other like materials, although imparting cooling effect to the mouth, also emit very strong undesirable odor and bitter taste. This is caused by the high volatility of menthol and like additives.

The above remarks establish a need in the art for a sweetener which provides the advantages of strong sweetening effects, the absence of exposure to cariogenic agents and, most importantly, high intense cooling effect without attendant undesirable odor and flavor.

Sweetening agents are employed in confectioneries, including chewing gums, as internal components. Sweetening agents, however, have also been employed as surface additives to confectionaries. Molded jellies and pastries are often “sanded” with sugars. Sugar sanding of these confectioneries provide an attractive appearance, keep molded pieces from sticking together during production and enhance initial sweetness.

Sanding of chewing gums, however, has not been practiced in the prior art. This is not to say that sugar coating of chewing gums is unknown in the art. “Dusting” of chewing gum has been practiced in the past. Sanding and dusting are distinguished processes in the confectionary arts. Dusting is defined as the application of a uniform coating of fine powder particles to a surface, such as the surface of a chewing gum stick. Sanding, on the other hand, involves the embedding of solid crystals below the surface of the confectionary, such as a chewing gum solid. Sanding, by definition, consists of making fine sugar crystals which adhere to the surfaces of the products by moistening them beforehand using techniques known in the art, such as by applying dry steam, or a hot solution of gum arabic or maltodextrin to the surface, and then subsequently drying the products.

Whereas dusting provides a uniform height of fine particles, sanding, involving as it does random penetration of the surface, results in contact with solid particles of varying height and thus different concentration of the particles.

Not only has there not been any sanding of chewing gum in the prior art; indeed, there has never been sugar alcohol sanding of any confectionary in the prior art. Although the inventors can only speculate as to the reason for this absence, they believe it is because sugar alcohols have a high degree of hydroscopicity.

Another distinction between dusting and sanding is that dusted particles are far smaller, resulting in higher surface areas per unit volume than the larger particles employed in sanding. This results in shorter duration of the effect of dusted particles than sanded particles.

The above remarks establish the need in the art for a sanded chewing gum, providing intense initial cooling accompanied by corresponding intense flavor provided by intense sweeteners.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A new chewing gum has now been developed which provides immediate and intense cooling and flavor effects. This chewing gum, moreover, overcomes a barrier to its use which has discouraged its earlier development.

In accordance with the present invention a chewing gum is provided. The chewing gum includes a solid which includes a chewing gum composition coated with wetting syrup and sanded with crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution.

In further accordance with the present invention a process is provided for preparing a sanded chewing gum. In this process a solid chewing gum composition is prepared by combining gum base and a sweetening agent. A wetting syrup which includes a tackifying agent, is applied to the solid chewing gum composition. Crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution are applied to the wetting syrup-coated solid chewing gum composition. The surface of the sanded chewing gum solid is dried to produce the final sanded chewing gum.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to food and/or confectionery compositions containing amorphous sugar wherein amorphous sugar either fully or partially replaces crystalline sugar during the production of compositions or ingredients or during the manufacture of chocolate products, coatings, fillers, or other chocolate food or confectionery ingredients. In one embodiment, the invention relates to a chocolate composition comprising amorphous sugar and crystallized sugar wherein the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystallized sugar is such that the combination has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature. An amorphous sugar or combinations of amorphous sugars can also completely replace crystalline sugar or be added separately from crystalline sugar in the production of a chocolate product or composition. In a further embodiment, amorphous sugar is combined with milk solids, cocoa solids and/or fruit purees or extracts, dried to a glass state having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least room temperature and incorporated into a cocoa-containing product or chocolate. The invention further relates to methods of producing confectionery, food, and chocolate compositions containing amorphous sugar, where the amorphous structure can be detected in the composition.

BACKGROUND

Chocolate compositions are typically produced using crystalline sugar, such as sucrose. Amorphous sugar is not used in the production of chocolate because of its water content. (Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use, 3d Ed., S. T. Beckett, ed., 1999, at 45). Also, amorphous sugar is capable of absorbing water from the environment and other chocolate ingredients, creating potential difficulties during processing and storage. For example, Minifie notes that anhydrous corn syrup is very hygroscopic and can cause trouble with moisture absorption during refining. (Bernard W. Minifie, Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d ed., Aspen Publishers, Inc., 1999, at 136). Furthermore, the amorphous state can be unstable, and amorphous sugars, such as sucrose, dextrose of lactose, tend to rapidly crystallize in the presence of moisture and/or release moisture from crystallization, which can negatively impact the interaction with other components. In addition, the addition of water to chocolate compositions results in an unacceptable gummy texture in the mouth. Small amounts of added water can cause severe rheological changes in the product and can lead to an unacceptable eating texture. (see Minifie, Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d ed., Aspen Publishers, Inc., 1999). Contrary to these observations, the present invention demonstrates that the full or partial replacement of crystalline sugar with amorphous sugar can produce acceptable chocolate compositions with the same behavior as conventional chocolate compositions. Some of the achievable benefits of replacing with amorphous sugar are a cost reduction, a decrease in calories, or a higher resistance to oil migration, for example in a peanut butter filled chocolate composition, and/or a higher resistance to water migration.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In a general aspect, the invention relates to novel food, confectionery, and especially chocolate compositions, and methods of producing them, where an amorphous sugar, such as a corn syrup solid, wholly or partially replaces a crystalline sugar ingredient. In one aspect or embodiment, an amorphous sugar is combined with cocoa solids, milk solids or fruit purees or extracts and incorporated into a chocolate product or composition. The chocolate products or compositions can be used as coatings, fillers, enrobing compositions, or other ingredients in a finished or final food or confectionery product. In a further aspect or embodiment, the invention relates to a chocolate composition comprising amorphous sugar and crystallized sugar, wherein the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystallized sugar is such that the combination of amorphous sugar and crystallized sugar has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature. In general, the amorphous sugar is detectable in the final product or composition and characteristic microstructures of the chocolate compositions in particular are defined below. Some of the many benefits of the invention include cost reduction, a decrease in calories, and/or a higher resistance to oil or water migration in food, chocolate, or confectionery products and during the storage of them.

In another general aspect, the invention encompasses the use of a characteristic glass transition temperature at different moisture contents for a variety of ratios of crystalline sugar:amorphous sugar in chocolate compositions, as well as the use of related information to modify the properties and contents of food products and compositions and/or improve manufacturing conditions or manufactured products. The resulting improvements and implications on food manufacturing and preparation systems allows one of ordinary skill in the art to, for example, vary compositions from a glassy to a rubbery state, modify the water content of foods and related compositions, and modify the processing conditions for food and especially chocolate products. Advantageously, water can be used to a higher extent than in conventional chocolate processing and less expensive amorphous sugars can replace crystalline sucrose, for example, while still retaining the melting properties and mouthfeel properties known to chocolate and milk chocolate compositions. Several techniques can be used to measure the glass transition and any available or appropriate technique can be used, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA).

The present invention also relates to specific chocolate compositions wherein amorphous sugar either wholly or partially replaces crystalline or crystallized sugar as an ingredient. The invention further relates to chocolate compositions wherein amorphous sugar is combined with milk solids, cocoa solids or fruit purees or fruit extracts and dried to a glass transition temperature (Tg) of greater than room temperature, or about 20° C., or about 25° C., or higher. The invention also relates to methods of producing chocolate compositions using amorphous sugar.

In one embodiment, the invention relates to a mixture or composition comprising about 45% by weight sugar, 45% by weight cocoa powder, and 10% by weight water as a composition having an amorphous solid that can be used in producing a chocolate or confectionery product or ingredient. The sugar component of the mixture or composition can consist entirely of amorphous sugar or a combination of amorphous sugar and crystalline sugar. In this and other embodiments or in mixing sugar to create a chocolate, the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar in the sugar ingredient can vary, for example from about 5:95, or about 10:90, or about 20:80, or about 30:70, or about 40:60, or about 50:50, or about 60:40, or about 70:30, or about 80:20, or about 90:10, or about 95:5, or 100:0, or any ratio in between these. In addition, the invention relates in general to sweetener compositions to be used in confectionery or food products comprising amorphous sugar and crystalline sugar wherein the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar is such that the combination has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature, or about 21° C., or about 25° C., or higher. For chocolate compositions in particular, any type of chocolate and chocolate under any desired standard of identity can be selected, such as milk chocolate, white chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and others.

Thus, the invention comprises a confectionery or food composition or ingredient comprising cocoa powder or cocoa liquor, a fat or cocoa butter equivalent, and up to about 50% sugar, wherein the crystalline sugar present is at least partially replaced by an amorphous sugar and the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar present in the composition results in a glass transition temperature (Tg) of the composition or ingredient of about room temperature, or about 21° C. or higher. As shown in the Figures, an amorphous microstructure can be detectable in the composition or ingredient, by for example microscopy, and can be identified by contrast with a crystalline material under microscopy. A preferred amorphous sugar comprises a corn syrup solid and in particular corn syrup solid DE 42. However, the amorphous sugar can comprises one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90, and DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin. Any of the chocolate compositions or ingredients of the invention can further comprise an emulsifier, such as a lecithin, and/or polyglycerol polyricinoleates (PGPR). Also, especially for milk chocolate compositions, coatings and ingredients, any composition of the invention can comprise a milk powder or one or more milk solids. In any embodiment where chocolate is employed, a cocoa product, powder or liquor can comprises an enhanced level of polyphenols or antioxidants, as known in the art.

In general, the compositions of the invention wherein the amorphous sugar is present can comprise amorphous sugar produced from a fruit puree, or additionally comprise a fruit puree or fruit extract. Any fruit or berry can be selected for such use.

In addition, any ingredient or composition of the invention can comprise or additionally comprise one or more carbohydrate sweeteners, nutritive sweeteners, or non-nutritive sweeteners.

In another general aspect, the invention comprises a method of producing a chocolate or milk chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar comprising: (a) combining water, one or more of chocolate, cocoa powder or cocoa liquor, optionally one of more of a milk powder or non-fat milk powder, and a sweetener composition comprising crystalline sugar and an amorphous sugar; and (b) heating until the water evaporates to a desired level of viscosity or to about 50 C or higher, wherein the sweetener composition contains or comprises at least sugar composition in a particular ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar, and wherein the water content and/or sugar:amorphous sugar content results in a product having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about of about 21° C. or higher. In these compositions, the amorphous sugar can be detectable through microscopy, for example. The method can further comprise mixing in a cocoa butter or a composition comprising a cocoa butter or a vegetable fat or a cocoa butter equivalent. In a preferred embodiment, the composition or method employs a sweetener composition having a crystalline sugar to corn syrup solids DE 42 ratio of about 50:50. The method or composition can further comprise adding or having a fruit puree or an extract from a fruit puree. As noted before, the method of the invention can use one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90 to DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin.

In another general aspect, the invention comprises a method of producing a chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar comprising: (a) selecting a sugar composition having a particular ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar wherein the ratio results in a composition having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least room temperature or at least about 20° C. or at least about 21° C. or least about 25° C.; (b) incorporating the sugar composition having a combination of crystalline sugar and amorphous sugar into a cocoa product and a fat and optionally an emulsifier to produce a chocolate composition. The method can further comprise adding one of more of milk powder, non-fat milk powder, or a milk product to produce a milk chocolate composition.

The amorphous solid or composition and/or the confectionery composition is generally produced to have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about room temperature or higher, or about 20° C. or higher, or about 25° C. or higher.

In any embodiment of the invention, the food composition or ingredient can also contain one or more crystalline sugar, preferably sucrose. In a preferred embodiment, the amorphous solid or composition consists essentially of a corn syrup solid, meaning one of more corn syrup solids is used together with food or edible ingredients that do not change the basic characteristics of the amorphous solid or composition and does not, or substantially does not, change the amorphous solid into a crystalline solid. It is known that certain compositions can be converted from an amorphous state to a crystalline state during a food manufacturing process. In one aspect of the invention, this conversion is substantially avoided or prevented in order to use an amorphous solid or composition. In another aspect, an amorphous solid or composition is an edible ingredient wherein a detectable amorphous structure is found, as shown in the Figures. In yet another aspect, an amorphous solid or composition additionally or alternatively has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 20° C. or higher. The examples show a non-limiting group of specific amorphous solids and compositions using corn syrup solids or fruit purees. Many other methods and ingredients can be used to prepare an edible, amorphous solid for use in this invention. Also, and as shown in the examples, the amorphous solid or composition and/or the final food or confectionary product or composition of the invention can comprise one or more sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners, and blends of sweeteners that are known in the art or available for use. The sweeteners can include polydextrose, inulin, polyols, sorbitol, maltodextrin, and sucralose, for example.

In a general aspect, an amorphous solid or composition as used in the invention can contain or consist essentially of a corn syrup solid, such as one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90, and DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin. It can also contain other edible or food ingredients or compounds, as shown in the Figures and described in the Examples. The preferred amorphous solid or composition consists essentially of corn syrup solid DE 42, such that the basic amorphous characteristics of the corn syrup are retained through processing. As in other chocolate or food products, the compositions of the invention can contain emulsifiers, lecithin or PGPR, or a combination of emulsifiers, as well as milk, water, concentrated milk, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, dried milk, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, evaporated skim milk, sweetened condensed skim milk, whey protein, non fat milk protein, whole milk powder milk solid or milk powder. Furthermore, the compositions of the invention can contain cocoa butter, a composition comprising cocoa butter, a vegetable fat, a cocoa butter equivalent, or a composition comprising one or more of fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil. The amorphous solid or composition can also contain cocoa solids and/or fruit puree.

A preferred embodiment is a composition that forms a milk chocolate coating, enrobing, or filler ingredient in a confectionery product. As is known in the art, specific cocoa containing products or ingredients can be used, such as those where level of polyphenols or antioxidants are enhanced, preserved, or enriched during processing as compared to conventional cocoa.

As shown in the Examples in particular, the invention also encompasses a process where a mixture containing an amorphous solid is produced and then added to other confectionery ingredients or chocolate ingredients before refining, conching, or molding. The process or method can also include heating, evaporation, vacuum treatment, or other method of removing or reducing moisture content. As in other aspects, removing moisture from the food composition or ingredient can be used to reach a desired viscosity.

In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of producing a chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar, the method comprising selecting a ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar to be used during production such that the final composition has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature and incorporating the crystalline sugar and amorphous sugar into chocolate. As noted, the ratio selected can vary and can even be up to 100% amorphous sugar or a combination of more than one amorphous sugar.

This application is directed to the manufacture of cocoa-based products and more particularly to the manufacture of nuggets having high levels of cocoa loading.

BACKGROUND

The health benefits of high antioxidant foods have become increasingly appreciated by greater segments of the population. Scientific studies suggest that certain plant compounds that act as antioxidants in foods may reduce the risk of many kinds of illness, from heart disease to cancer.

Cocoa comes from cacao beans (or cocoa beans), which grow on the cacao tree. Cocoa beans are full of polyphenolics and other natural plant nutrients. The polyphenolics, also called flavanols, have a high oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The antioxidants found in cocoa have been linked to certain hallmarks of good cardiovascular health such as enhanced blood flow, healthy cholesterol levels and, in some cases, reduced blood pressure. In fact, two tablespoons of natural cocoa have more antioxidant capacity than three cups of green tea, a half cup of blueberries or a glass of red wine.

However, the high level of polyphenols also contributes to a highly bitter taste. As a result, high loading of cocoa powder in foods to obtain maximum benefits of the antioxidants from the cocoa is generally limited in order to make those foods more palatable. High levels of cocoa powder also generally necessitate changes to product formulation and introduces processing difficulties, causing significant losses in antioxidant levels as a result of the processing.

A method and product are desired to deliver high levels of cocoa antioxidant with minimal undesirable modification of the taste, formulation or process of the food product containing the cocoa.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to concentrated cocoa powder nuggets and methods of making such nuggets that can be used as an ingredient such as an inclusion or a topping for food products in order to increase antioxidant levels. The nugget is manufactured by creating a dough followed by forming the dough into nuggets by methods such as rotary moulding, sheeting and cutting, or cold extrusion. In some cases, the nuggets may then be baked or dried to remove excess moisture and obtain desired texture and shelf life. The nuggets can be crunchy or chewy.

In one embodiment, a method for creating a cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including, on a dry basis, at least 30% by weight cocoa powder, the dough having a moisture content of at least 10% to about 52% by weight; and processing the dough into nuggets having a moisture content of not greater than about 15% by weight.

In another embodiment, a method for creating a chewy cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including on a dry basis, at least 50% by weight non-alkalized cocoa powder, the dough having a moisture content of at least 15% by weight, the dough further including about 20% to 45% by weight of a binding agent; and processing the dough into nuggets having a moisture content in the range of about 10% to about 15% by weight and a water activity not greater than 0.6, wherein the nuggets exhibit a loss of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of less than 5% compared to the provided dough.

In yet another embodiment, a method for creating a crunchy cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including, on a dry basis, at least 50% by weight cocoa powder, and, on a dry basis, less than 20% by weight sweetener, the dough having a moisture content of at least 35% by weight; forming the dough into nuggets; and baking the nuggets to dry to a nugget moisture content of not greater than about 6% by weight, wherein the baked nuggets exhibit a loss of ORAC of less than 5% compared to the provided dough.

Among the advantages of exemplary embodiments is that a cocoa nugget can be formed as an ingredient that has a high retention of cocoa antioxidants during and after processing, can have low or no sugar content, can include other nutrients such as proteins, minerals, and can be controlled to provide shelf stable products of either a crunchy or chewy texture.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

This application is directed to the manufacture of confectionery products and more particularly to the manufacture of heat stable chocolate and chocolaty candy.

BACKGROUND

Traditional chocolate making methods are well known and involve several basic steps carried out in a particular order. Generally, the process starts with cocoa beans harvested from pods of melon-like fruit that grow on the cacao tree. The cocoa beans are removed from the pods and placed in large heaps or piles to ferment, during which the shells of the beans harden and darken and a rich cocoa flavor develops.

Dried cocoa beans are roasted at very high temperatures and hulled to separate the shell from the inside of the bean, also called a “nib,” the part of the bean actually used to make chocolate. The nibs are milled by a grinding process that turns the nibs into a liquid called chocolate liquor.

The chocolate liquor, which is sometimes separated in advance into its constituents, cocoa butter and cocoa powder, is mixed with a sweetener, usually sugar, and in the case of milk chocolate, milk solids are also added.

The chocolate liquor is also combined with milk and sugar and is dried to a coarse, brown powder called chocolate crumb. Additional cocoa butter may be added to the chocolate crumb, after which the mixture passes through steel rollers which refine the mixture above the melting point of the cocoa butter, resulting in a chocolate powder. The chocolate powder is then conched, a process in which the chocolate powder is maintained above the fat melting temperature while mixing elements smooth out gritty particles, remove moisture and off-flavors, and develop pleasant flavors. Conching also releases fat from the chocolate powder, increasing the fat coating on the particles so that the chocolate has a proper fluidity for further processing. Additional fat is added to achieve the full formulated fat content and emulsifiers are also added to reduce viscosity and enhance fluidity of the chocolate paste. The liquid chocolate paste is tempered and then poured or deposited into a mould to produce a chocolate bar or used for enrobed products.

The melting temperature of cocoa butter and other fats sometimes used with or in place of cocoa butter in certain chocolate making processes is in the range of 29° C. to 35° C. As a result, chocolate bars and other chocolate confections cannot always be readily transported, stored or enjoyed in the summertime or in tropical climates where temperatures of unconditioned spaces typically reach or exceed the melting point of the fat in the chocolate. Even where the confections are stored or consumed in a conditioned space, if they melt during transit and then resolidify, the products may become misshapen or exhibit bloom, a condition in which the melted fat in the chocolate recrystallizes in a different structure resulting in a change in appearance or texture that can render the product unappealing.

Various attempts have been directed to trying to develop a heat stable chocolate that could better withstand conditions of elevated temperature. Efforts to date have generally involved modifying formulations by adding ingredients to the chocolate that provide heat stability. In some cases, special ingredients are added that are designed to absorb moisture during processing or after packaging. In other cases, water is incorporated directly into the chocolate during manufacture, such as using water-oil emulsions. However, chocolate products made using these kinds of additional ingredients generally have a dry, crumbly texture that is undesirable and also suffer from flavor deterioration over a shorter shelf life as a result of the high moisture content. In still other cases, high melting fats have been used, but chocolate confections having these kinds of fats are also disfavored because they tend to have a negative, waxy eating quality.

These and other drawbacks are associated with current methods of confectionery production.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to producing chocolate confectionery products that do not need to be specially formulated and can be made with traditional chocolate making ingredients, but which still exhibit heat stable characteristics. Methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments result in a chocolate confectionery product having a rheology such that the product retains its shape above the melting point of fats in the product, while retaining a flavor and mouthfeel comparable with chocolate made by traditional methods.

In one embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising a chocolate compatible fat and a sweetener; thereafter refining the mixture to form a powder having a predetermined average particle size; thereafter agitating the refined powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible fat to form a dough; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product.

In another embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising a chocolate compatible tempering fat, milk, cocoa solids and sugar; thereafter refining the mixture to form a chocolate powder having an average particle size in the range of about 10 to about 30 microns at a temperature less than the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible tempering fat; thereafter agitating the refined chocolate powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible tempering fat to form a dough; tempering the dough in the presence of greater than about 0.3% by weight tempering seed; forming the dough into a predetermined shape; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product. The amount of fat present in the mixture being refined is about 29% by weight or greater.

In yet another embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising cocoa solids, sugar, milk fat, and a chocolate compatible fat selected from the group consisting of cocoa butter replacements, cocoa butter substitutes and combinations thereof; thereafter refining the mixture to form a chocolate powder having a predetermined average particle size; thereafter agitating the refined chocolate powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible fat to form a dough; thereafter forming the dough into a predetermined shape; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product.

In still another embodiment, a heat stable confectionery product is provided that includes cocoa solids, milk solids, sugar, and a chocolate compatible fat, wherein the chocolate compatible fat has a melting temperature in the range of about 29° C. to about 35° C., and wherein the product has a smooth texture and a shelf life up to at least 6 months at temperatures above 32° C. Any other ingredients are present in amounts that do not interfere with the product's ability to form a dough above the melting temperature of the fat.

An advantage is that chocolate confectionery products produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments have a rheology such that the product maintains its shape above the melting temperature of the fat in the chocolate, without becoming messy or liquid-like.

Another advantage is that chocolate confectionery products produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments can be formulated with the same as or less than the overall fat content as chocolate confectioneries produced by traditional methods.

Yet another advantage is that methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments can produce chocolate confections using traditional chocolate making ingredients and avoid the kind of additives previously used to create heat stable chocolate that result in undesirable eating qualities and poor shelf life.

Still another advantage is that methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments can produce chocolate confections that have a stable texture at elevated temperatures, but still having a taste and texture, as well as shelf life, comparable to chocolate confections produced by traditional methods.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

This application is directed to flexible packaging and more particularly to flexible bags and other packages having a feature for controlling access to the package and its contents.

BACKGROUND

Candy and other food products are often packaged in bulk and consumed incrementally over time. Consumers prefer such packages be closed when not being actively consumed to maintain freshness, encourage portion control, and to prevent accidental spillage during handling and/or storage. In some cases, the reclosure of a package may be achieved by the use of a separate clip provided by the consumer and affixed to the bag. Zipper closures incorporated directly in the package are also commonly used as a reclosure feature.

Among the drawbacks of current package reclosure features are that the consumer often does not consider the need for a clip until after the bag is open. The consumer then must search for the clip among a drawer full of odds and ends while trying not to spill the contents of the now-opened package. Zipper closures formed as part of the package can be slightly more handy, but are expensive to produce. Zipper closures also present consumers difficulties in the visual or palpable determination whether a proper closure has been achieved until after the packages is in a position that would result in spillage if the zipper was not properly closed.

Furthermore, current reclosure features are provided to achieve only that limited purpose. They do not act as a true access control feature that can also aid in keeping the package open when its contents are desired to be consumed.

These and other drawbacks are found in current product packaging.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to flexible packaging that contains an access control feature for reclosing the packaging in a robust, repeatable manner that provides a readily identifiable way for a consumer to conclude the package is safely closed. In certain embodiments, the access control feature further assists in keeping the package open for easy access where, for example, repeated servings are likely to occur in short succession. Exemplary embodiments employ one or more strips formed of a malleable sheet of material capable of maintaining a dead fold incorporated into the package.

According to an embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of a malleable sheet material attached to the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package.

According to another embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of metallic foil attached to the first package side wall, extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package and the strip of metallic foil is oriented substantially horizontally with respect to the mouth of the packaging, the strip of metallic foil having a fold guide formed therein comprising a score extending linearly across the strip of the metallic foil.

According yet another embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of metallic foil attached to the first package side wall and extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package. The strip of the metallic foil is oriented substantially vertically with respect to the mouth of the packaging, the strip of metallic foil having a plurality of fold guides formed therein, each fold guide comprising a score extending linearly along the width of the strip of metallic foil, whereby the fold guides are oriented substantially horizontally with the mouth of the packaging.

In one embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of a polymer coated metallic foil heat sealed to a surface of the first package side wall, the foil extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall, the foil having a thickness in the range of about 0.003 inches to about 0.005 inches. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package. The strip of foil is oriented substantially horizontally with respect to the mouth of the package, the foil having a fold guide formed therein comprising a score extending linearly substantially parallel to the mouth of the package.

An advantage is that a flexible package is provided that is easy to close and operates in an intuitive manner, while providing visual assurance that the package has been closed.

Another advantage is that incorporation of a fold guide into the strip of the malleable sheet material provides a tactile cue to the user for properly closing the package.

Yet another advantage is that the use of the strip of malleable sheet material can also be used to maintain the mouth of the package open for easier access to its contents.

Still another advantage is that exemplary embodiments of the invention may be less expensive to produce than packages with zipper style closures, while still providing an integrated closure feature.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

This application is directed to agglomerates for forming flavored beverages. More particularly, the present invention is directed to cocoa and sugar based agglomerates for use in creating cold liquid beverages and methods for forming the agglomerates.

BACKGROUND

Many popular consumer beverages are formed by adding a flavored mix to a liquid. The flavored mix is provided in various forms including syrups, powders, and the like. One common consumer beverage category includes chocolate-flavored drinks such as chocolate-flavored milk and hot chocolate.

Production of chocolate-flavored drinks often includes mixing syrup or powder into a liquid. Powdered mixes are typically formed by dry blending powder ingredients, or by spray drying, freeze drying, or a rewet agglomeration process followed by grinding into fine agglomerates or powders. The fine agglomerates or powders used in known mixtures have small particle size. While they can provide good dispersibility/solubility in warm liquids, these small particles have slow dispersibility and/or low solubility in cold liquids. For this reason, syrup is commonly added to make a chocolate-flavored beverage when starting with a cold liquid, even though powdered mixtures are commonly added to a hot liquid.

The small particles of powder mixtures can float, which in combination with general decreased solubility of materials in cold liquids, compounds the difficulty of using powders in those situations. Additionally, the small particles can form a dust which can be messy and increases difficulty in handling and using powder mixtures. The problem of slow dispersibility or low solubility in cold liquids for making chocolate-flavored beverages is further exacerbated by the presence of cocoa powder to provide a chocolate flavor. Cocoa powder is difficult to wet and/or rehydrate in cold liquids.

These and other drawbacks are associated with current materials used for forming flavored cold cocoa or chocolate beverages.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to a cold liquid cocoa and sugar based agglomerate and methods of forming such agglomerates that readily disintegrate in a cold liquid, such as milk.

According to exemplary embodiments, a method of forming cocoa and sugar based agglomerates comprises mixing cocoa powder, sugar and an aqueous ethanol solution to form a dough and drying the dough to form a porous dried dough piece having less than 0.5% by weight residual ethanol.

Exemplary embodiments are further directed to a process of making agglomerates of 2 mm in size or larger, often 5 mm in size or larger, that submerse and disintegrate instantly into cold aqueous liquids, such as cold water or cold milk. The agglomerates are composed of cocoa powder and a sweetener such as sugars, and typically include other dry ingredients such as milk powders, fibers, corn syrup solids, and flavoring agents. The agglomerates have a porous structure in which the dry powders are lightly bridged by a thin layer of sugar coating. The porous structure is formed by vacuum removal of a solvent that is used to wet and agglomerate dry powder ingredients into pieces.

The pieces formed can be large chunks of 50 mm or greater in size. The chunks can be further reduced into smaller particles or pieces of 2 mm or larger or a sheet of dough can be cut into the desired piece size. The solvent is aqueous ethanol, which controls the solubility of sugar as a binder in forming the agglomerates or large pieces.

In one embodiment, a method of forming cold liquid dispersible/soluble cocoa and sugar based agglomerates includes preparing an aqueous ethanol solution that contains at least 50% by weight ethanol, more preferably about 80% by weight ethanol. The aqueous ethanol solution is added to a pre-blend of dry powders of finely granulated sweeteners, such as 6× sugar, and cocoa powder. The amount of aqueous ethanol solution added to the powder blend is the minimum amount needed to form agglomerates or wet dough, at least 10% (wt/wt) or above, typically about 20% (wt/wt) or above, even preferably about 25% (wt/wt) or above, up to about 40% (wt/wt). The mixture is mixed in a mixer, like a Hobart mixer, to form small agglomerates or a wet dough.

The aqueous ethanol solvent can be removed using a high vacuum drier, e.g. 99% or above vacuum (7600 MmTorr) at a temperature below or above the solvent freezing point and results in a porous structure that can readily submerse, disperse, and dissolve in cold as well as hot aqueous liquid. The relatively larger particle size of 2 mm or greater of the porous particles or pieces can submerse into liquid faster by its own weight, and a thin bridge of sugar coating between dry powder granules dissolves fast and make the whole pieces or chunks disintegrate in both cold or hot liquids almost instantly.

Among the advantages of exemplary embodiments is that methods described herein produce porous cocoa-sugar based agglomerates that disintegrate quickly and thoroughly in cold liquids.

Another advantage is that the methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments provide control over porosity of the agglomerates, which in turn provides control over the dispersibility/solubility of the agglomerates.

Still another advantage is that the methods provides control of binder solubility therefore control of thin bridge between granules, which in turn provides control of dispersibility/solubility of the agglomerates or pieces.

Also another advantage is that the methods produce agglomerates or pieces or chunks in large size, which includes a reduction in the difficulty associated with handling fine powders associated with current powdered beverage mixtures and also helps with portion control.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments that illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

This application is directed to comestibles and more particularly to rapidly dissolving comestible solids.

BACKGROUND

Mints and chewing gum are commonly used by consumers to freshen breath after meals, before personal interactions, and in other social situations. While these products are generally effective, there are many situations in which a consumer desires fresh breath but doesn't have time for a traditional tablet mint to dissolve or to chew gum long enough to achieve the desired level of freshness.

Mouthwash is a quick and effective way to freshen one's breath, but is generally not a suitable alternative in most cases for a variety of reasons. Another manner of providing a quicker way in which to achieve freshness has been the use of products generally known as breath strips, which are dissolvable films containing breath freshening ingredients. Breath strips have their own attendant drawbacks, including a propensity to stick to the roof of one's mouth and a mouthfeel that some consumers find unpleasant. Breath strips can sometimes also start to become sticky and/or dissolve on contact with the skin when removed from their container, particularly in humid weather.

These and other drawbacks are found in current breath fresheners and other products.

SUMMARY

What is needed is a comestible product that provides a tactile shape and mouthfeel consistent with a traditional tablet mint but that has a rapid dissolution that is more characteristic of a breath strip, to which exemplary embodiments are directed.

According to an exemplary embodiment, a rapidly dissolving comestible solid comprises a fondant of a super saturated solution of a bulk sweetener, a texturizing agent and, optionally, a hydrocolloid, wherein the fondant has a crystalline structure that does not exhibit cold flow at room temperature.

According to another exemplary embodiment, a method of making a rapidly dissolving comestible solid comprising mixing a bulk sweetener, a texturizing agent and a hydrocolloid in water to form a solution; cooking the solution to a temperature in the range of about 280° F. to about 300° F. to form a fondant; cooling the fondant to a temperature in the range of about 100° F. to about 150° F. to initiate crystal formation; extruding the fondant into a sheet; optionally applying indicia on the fondant; cutting the sheet of fondant; curing the fondant; and breaking the fondant into pieces.

An advantage of certain embodiments is that a comestible product is provided that has a tactile shape and mouthfeel consistent with a traditional tablet mint but that dissolves much more rapidly.

Another advantage is that the comestible product is made of a fondant that does not exhibit cold flow at room temperature, resulting in a stand-alone fondant product that does not require a shell or other support to retain its shape.

Still another advantage of certain embodiments is that the comestible products in accordance with exemplary embodiments can be manufactured according to either a batch or a continuous process.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments which, along with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to new beverage products made from water steeped in a cocoa product or powder as well as combinations of this beverage with one or more functional or healthful ingredients, such as energy-producing, stimulating, immune-defense, heart health, detoxifying, muscle recuperating, cognition enhancing, or relaxing ingredients or supplements, for example. In general, the beverages contain a percentage of a cocoa water ingredient having beneficial or significant levels of cocoa antioxidants, optionally in combination with one or more vitamins, extracts, or nutriceuticals known in the art. The preferred fortified, refreshing, and/or energy-sustaining beverages of the invention can be produced as a ready-to-drink product, a concentrate, or as a mix or packet to produce a beverage. In preferred and advantageous embodiments, the beverages can be produced as a tea-type drink, a flavored or enhanced water drink, a juice cocktail-type drink, or an energy drink, and may optionally contain healthy ingredients in addition to the beneficial cocoa antioxidants and energy-producing ingredients. In other advantageous aspects, the methods of the invention permit effective filtering and processing of a cocoa/water mixture as well as options to reduce or substantially reduce the appearance of a surface fat ring, or cocoa fat ring, commonly present in the beverage containers of fat-containing compositions upon storage.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

A variety of cocoa beverages have been available. Almost exclusively, however, these products employ a milk or liquor base to dissolve the cocoa or maintain the cocoa solids in solution. Immediate examples include chocolate milk and cocoa or chocolate liqueurs. However, as more and more evidence shows the benefit of cocoa antioxidants or cocoa polyphenol compounds, a variety of food products with these compounds are desirable. The invention, in one aspect, addresses this desire by combining conventional tea steeping processes with cocoa polyphenol-containing products, concentrates or extracts to produce a refreshing cocoa beverage that optionally includes energizing and/or stimulating ingredients. In another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of filtering a mixture of a cocoa product and water or aqueous solution, as prior methods were prone to clogging and inefficiencies that prevent commercial production. In yet another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of fat rings commonly found in the container or at the surface of a beverage containing fat, such as the fat of cocoa butter.

Also, various energy drinks and infused or fortified teas have been marketed or suggested. However, due to at least the technical problems in using cocoa products in steeping processes, none of these tea products have been based upon cocoa as a basic ingredient. Furthermore, the desire for products containing cocoa antioxidants has increased, and therefore the art is in need of improved beverage products based upon cocoa.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to beverages made from steeped cocoa or what is referred to as “cocoa water,” which can be produced from cocoa products such as cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa powder, cacao nibs, or other cacao bean compositions. In one aspect, the invention relates to novel methods for making and the novel use of a steeped or brewed cocoa water as described herein. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a method for producing a refreshing beverage containing cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, and which in certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or is a low calorie beverage. In another aspect, the cocoa water can be produced from a method of steeping cocoa products and filtering or removing solids or particulates, and then optionally combining this cocoa water with a juice or extract, such as a fruit, herbal, or vegetable juice or extract, that provides nutritional elements and reduces the astringency or bitterness commonly present in a cocoa composition. The cocoa water component itself provides a novel, refreshing base and contains cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, which can be the base material for a number of mixed beverage compositions or a primary beverage component. Combinations of coca water with fruit juices and/or extracts, or multiple fruit juices and/or extracts, are especially preferred in this regard, however the cocoa water can be mixed with sweeteners and water or tea or other beverage to produce a tea-type beverage also. In preferred embodiments, the cocoa water contains no detectable solid or particulate matter as determined by conventional beverage tasting methods, such as taste tests. In other preferred embodiments, the cocoa water contains no detectable particles over 50 microns in diameter, or has substantially no particles above 50 microns in diameter, or substantially no particles above 20 microns, or above 10 microns, or above 5 microns in diameter. Certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or can be a low calorie beverage. The beverage can be sealed in a container for commercial distribution and be shelf-stable for about 1 to about 9 months, or more than 9 months, or at least six months at room temperature. A variety of filtering, irradiating, heating, centrifugation, or treatment methods, or a combination of these, can be used to produce a beverage capable of stable storage over a period of time. Other similar or compatible methods known or available in the art can also be used.

The method for producing the cocoa water can include the use of purified or sterilized water at certain temperatures, or at a number of desired temperatures or ranges in temperature. However, any potable water or even flavored or carbonated water can be used. Filtering or purifying methods to remove insoluble components, or most of or substantially all of the insoluble components can be used, as known in the art. Preferred water includes carbon filtered water, deionized water, and/or water purified by reverse osmosis. In addition, aqueous solutions can be used, such as buffered aqueous solutions of citric acid, more preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% citric acid, or about 0.4% to about 0.7%, or about 0.6% citric acid at about pH 4 or below, or between about pH 3 and pH 4. An aqueous solution prepared from water previously mixed with cocoa nibs can also be used. The use of this cocoa nib-treated water can provide additional cocoa flavoring, and the cocoa nib-treated water can also be free of fat and/or substantially free of calories. After steeping the water or aqueous solution with the cocoa product, the water is filtered or purified to produce a ready-to-drink beverage base referred to as cocoa water. An optional filtering or clarifying filter process to prepare an essentially colorless cocoa water can also be used in certain embodiments, and various beverage and juice filtration systems are available for this purpose. The cocoa water can optionally be concentrated by methods known in the art, and then used by adding water and optionally sweeteners and/or flavorings to produce a ready-to-drink product.

As noted, the cocoa water can be used as a base and one or more functional ingredients added to produce a final beverage or an ingredient for a food or beverage. Thus, the invention encompasses many different cocoa-based compositions and products and the methods for producing them.

In certain preferred embodiments, the base cocoa water composition is used with one or more fruit juices, which here encompasses fruit-based products and fruit juice concentrates and/or fruit extracts and/or essence of fruits or extracts. Any available fruit can be used for these juices, concentrates, or extracts, as well as any combination of two or more. However, preferred examples include: citrus fruits; orange; tangerine; cranberry; pomegranate; black currant; blueberry; grape; concord grape; white grape; pear; and apple. Additional fruits are listed below and throughout this document and its examples. Surprisingly, the combination of a fruit juice and the cocoa water provides a refreshing flavor that masks or blocks the sometimes bitter or astringent flavors in the cocoa water itself. Generally, the cocoa water concentrations in the final beverage are about 5% to about 10%, or about 10% to about 20%, or about 10% to about 60%, and the optional fruit juice is about 8% to about 40%. As noted below and throughout this document, many other ranges or specific beverages can be selected and used.

In other embodiments, a tea or tea product can, alternatively or additionally, be added to the cocoa water to produce a beverage. Various teas can be selected for use, including green tea, white tea, and any available tea blends. Similarly, elixirs, extracts and/or antioxidant preparations can be used as an additive in the beverages, such as extracts of green tea, white tea, cacao beans or nibs, grapeseed, blueberries, raspberries, black currant, cranberries, Japanese knotweed, or other antioxidant-containing food product, botanical, or other source.

In other energy-providing examples or in any of the examples discussed here, caffeine, theobromine, guarana, taurine, and other compounds can be present or added to the beverage.

In another aspect, the beverages include one or more flavors or flavor combinations or mixes, especially those compatible with beverages or what is known as beverage flavors. The flavors are compatible with the cocoa water base of the beverages and can be selected from those commonly used with cocoa and chocolate products, for example, and/or tea products. A concentrated plant extract, or essence, can also be used and refers to a concentrated plant extract containing its unique flavor and fragrance and capable of being used in a food, beverage, or for human consumption.

In another aspect, the invention comprises packets or dried beverage components for producing a beverage or composition of the invention. The packets can be similar to tea bags and can be submerged in water for steeping, as desired. The dried beverage components can be produced from conventional or available drying, spray drying, or concentrating processes of the art.

Preferably, the methods and products use natural cocoa or extracts that are not treated with alkaline, a process also known as “Dutching.” However, as noted, a variety of cocoa powders, cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa compositions, and cacao bean compositions are known and available to one of skill in the art and can be selected for use in any aspect of the invention. In addition, cocoa products or extracts with enhanced levels of cocoa polyphenols or cocoa flavanols, or extracts with additives, can also be selected for use. Defatted or non-fat cocoa products, such as defatted cocoa powder, can also be used alone or with other cocoa products. Furthermore, combinations of available cocoa powders, extracts, enhanced extracts, concentrates, extracts with additives can be selected and used for any aspect of the invention. The terms “cocoa powder,” “cocoa extract,” and “cocoa bean composition” for steeping, thus, can be any of a variety of products and combinations as well as specific combinations of the cacao bean-derived products noted in this disclosure.

In particularly preferred embodiments, the invention comprises beverages that contain efficacious flavanols, flavanoids, polyphenols, antioxidants, cocoa polyphenols and/or cocoa antioxidants and/or other cocoa-derived compounds or compositions. These beverages can be used in a healthy diet, for example a diet to improve cardiovascular conditions or prevent cardiovascular disease or maintain weight. Another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage composition that is a sugar-free and/or calorie-free cocoa beverage. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage that is sugar-free and/or calorie-free and optionally contains other available or known supplements, active ingredients, appetite suppressing agents, and similar agents or ingredients, especially those also found in antioxidant-containing foods, herbs, teas, coffees, or food product ingredients. Further, the beverage or packet composition may also or in addition be combined with one or more other dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc., to provide a nutritional or dietary supplement. Any of these combinations of the invention can advantageously provide benefits to human health and capture additional beneficial effects. Also, all of the ingredients or combinations may be combined with appropriate stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, binders, carageenans, and other edible or ingestible compounds known to one of skill in the art in the industry to produce a packet or beverage.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. In a similar aspect, the invention includes methods to produce a cocoa water composition, and the compositions themselves, whereby the propensity to form a fat ring on a storage container of the cocoa water or a final product is substantially reduced or minimized. In particular, the invention includes the use of acidifying conditions or low pH buffering additives, such as citric acid, lactic acid and/or phosphoric acid compounds or combinations, used at one or more steps in the production process. Preferably, a pH of about 3.5 or below can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring on the container after storage. Filtration steps, filter aids, centrifugation steps, and settling time, all at selected or different temperatures, can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring. Additionally, the use of low fat cocoa powder, with about 1.2% fat, can reduce the appearance of a fat ring. In general, low fat cocoa powder contains lees than 10% cocoa butter, and defatted cocoa powder contains less than 2% cocoa butter. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low in fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The products and the methods of the invention can, in any embodiment, also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Beverage emulsifiers, beverage stabilizers, weighting agents, thickeners can also be added, and a preferred group is polysorbates, carrageenans, Tween 60, Tween 80, and gum arabic. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to chromatography methods useful in identifying, purifying, and quantifying multiple oligomeric flavanol compounds. More specifically, and in one aspect, the invention relates to the use of liquid-liquid partition chromatography with extracts and samples fromTheobroma cacaobeans. In another aspect, the invention relates to a more efficient or simultaneous purification of multiple procyanidins or flavanol oligomers from a sample.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Flavan-3-ol derivatives, such as catechins and procyanidin polymers, are prevalent antioxidant compounds ofTheobroma cacaoseeds or beans or nibs. Numerous reports have discussed the potential benefits of these compounds on human health and wellbeing. However, due to at least the complexity of their source from plant material, methods of purification, identification and quantification of specific polymers and oligomers of these compounds have been difficult to achieve in reliable and efficient ways. Generally, for food products and for cocoa products in particular, functional assays such as ORAC have been used to refer to the level of these compounds present. Commercial standards for comparison of many cocoa-derived oligomers are not available and thus limit the ability to produce reliable quantitative methods for isolation.

Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) is a relatively new and unique method of liquid-liquid partition chromatography. CPC enables the separation of components with nearly identical partition ratios and can be performed without the aid of a solid support.

CPC can be categorized in several ways. First, CPC is a type of countercurrent chromatography, which is an automated liquid-liquid extraction process permitting hundreds of automatic successive extractions. CPC is also a type of liquid-liquid partition chromatography, a technique involving a liquid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase. The solute equilibrates between the stationary and mobile liquids. Finally, CPC utilizes a centrifugal force from a spinning rotor to effectively pump solutes through a column region and separate compounds.

CPC is unique because no solid support is used for the stationary phase. Instead, the liquid stationary phase is retained in a chamber by a combination of centrifugal force, the geometry, and the density difference between two liquid phases. The CPC apparatus consists of a rotor that employs a particular mode of motion. The rotor contains one or more chambers in which channels are engraved. The less dense stationary phase remains in the column because of the centrifugal force created by the spinning rotor. Consequently, the mobile phase is able to pass through the stationary phase.

When a mixture of components is introduced into the mobile phase of the CPC chamber, it distributes according to the individual components' distribution coefficients. The centrifugal force applied promotes the retention of the stationary phase against a continuous flow of mobile phase. The mobile phase flow enables the two phases to interact sufficiently for partition to occur, resulting in chromatographic separation.

The degree of separation in centrifugal partition chromatography depends primarily on the partition coefficient of the solute between the two solvent phases. Other important parameters in the separation process include mass transfer coefficients, flow rate, rotational frequency, and the identity of the two phases. A variety of the two-phase systems are possible using the CPC column. Both organic and aqueous systems are feasible. In fact, using CPC chromatography, aqueous two-phase systems can be used for separation. And, importantly, CPC can be used to separate racemic mixtures into chirally pure compounds.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention, in one aspect, satisfies a need for efficient and reliable isolation methods for catechin compounds and oligomers that has intriguing commercial advantages on several fronts. Initially, it provides the art with an avenue to isolate individual procyanidin compounds that is straightforward and cost-effective. This allows one to use these isolated compounds in clinical studies. In addition, the methods allow one to quantitate multiple procyanidin oligomers more efficiently, and within the same sample or experiment. Similarly, by providing a standardized protocol for treating cocoa-containing samples and using CPC methods for purification or analysis, the invention potentially allows commercial or standardized ways to record levels of specific procyanidin compounds or subsets of specific procyanidin compounds that may be present in food ingredients or food products. In addition, the invention allows for the isolation of specific chiral-active oligomers from those present in cocoa or plant sources, for example.

Procyanidins are very common constituents of plants and are believed to be the second most common class of natural phenolic substances found in nature, after lignans. Because they are well represented in the Western diet, such as in cocoa, apples, and many berries, there is a growing interest in determining their pharmacological properties and significance as dietary antioxidants. Responding to these demands, the present invention involves a novel and advantageous approach to the preparative fractionation of cocoa procyanidins according to their degree of polymerization (DP) by applying a liquid-liquid (no solid support) chromatography, such as with a method known as Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (FCPC) with commercialized rotors (for example, Kromaton, Annonay, France). The liquid-liquid system avoids the common problems in purifying flavonoids and flavan-3-ols, as they are prone to adhere to solid supports. In addition, as it is known that the chirality of cocoa flan-3-ols and flavanols effects their bioavailability and that distinct chiral species have differing biological activity, the methods can be used to isolate specific chiral compounds and subsets of chiral compounds from plants and cocoa in particular. Current methods involving a chiral HPLC column can be used to separate enantiomeric forms, but the time per run is in excess of an hour with minimal ability to scale up the process for larger quantities. Thus, CPC and FCPC as described here offers not only the ability to separate various enantiomeric forms but the scalability to isolate sufficient amounts on a cost effective basis so that they can be used in clinical and consumer studies.

In an experiment optimized for the best separation of procyanidin DP families between 4 and 12, one can employ a solvent system consisting of ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (6:1:5) in an ascending mode, wherein the mobile phase is the upper phase in each of the columns. However, other ratios of these solvents, as well as other, similar solvents as discussed herein, can be selected and used and one such example is ethyl acetate:ethanol:water (8:1:2). The procyanidin oligomers (DP2 to DP14) eluted with the mobile phase in an order of increasing DP, which is associated with an increasing polarity. The separation of bands between DP5 and DP9 was particularly impressive and advantageous in a context of the best preparative approaches reported for these compounds to date. The fractionation can be monitored by a normal phase HPLC analysis on a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) column as well as by a C18 Reverse Phase (RP) column. To confirm and supplement this data, spectroscopic mass analysis of selected fractions by MALDI-TOF can be used. The Reverse Phase HPLC analysis reveals that in each DP family, the dominant peaks represented the linear epicatechin (4β-8) oligomers. However, using the FCPC fractionation approach, higher procyanidin oligomers can be separated and in advantageous quantities, such as those quantities required for evaluation of clinical or biological properties.

Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a scalable method for the bulk isolation and purification of cocoa procyanidin oligomers of varying length including DP2 through DP14, or subsets within this range of DP levels, such as DP2 through DP12 or DP 4 to DP12, as well as any specific procyanidin oligomer that may be present in plant and cocoa samples, including distinct or specific chiral species of the oligomeric compounds present in a fraction containing multiple oligomeric forms of a certain DP length. The methods and compositions of the invention are not limited to the oligomeric range DP2 to DP14, but this range is preferred. Thus, species higher than DP14 can be isolated from the methods of the invention.

In one aspect of the liquid-liquid partition chromatography methods of the invention, the invention includes a method of purifying at least one procyanidin oligomer compound from a cocoa-containing sample by optionally first defatting a cocoa-containing sample. The defatting step can comprise an extraction with a solvent comprising one or more of an alcoholic solvent, an aqueous solvent, or both an alcoholic and aqueous solvent. In other examples, the defatting step can be required. The examples below refer to various solvents that can be used. Other defatting methods or extractions can be used, such as extraction with hexane or acetone and other organic solvent extractions, as well as supercritical fluid extraction methods available in the art.

A solvent system of a mobile phase lipophillic solvent, a bridging solvent of one of more alcohols, and a stationary phase aqueous solvent can be selected for the intended or expected composition of the sample. The stationary and mobile phases can be reversed from those just stated or from those stated anywhere in this specification. In one example, the cocoa-derived samples (or extract) containing procyanidins DP3 to DP12 (or DP4 to DP12) can employ water or an aqueous solvent as the stationary phase solvent and ethyl acetate as the mobile phase solvent. However, the stationary and mobile phases can also be reversed, so that the stationary phase is ethyl acetate. The cocoa-containing sample is mixed with the mobile and stationary phase solvents and then added to a reservoir in a rotor. The rotor is prepared with multiple interconnected mixing chambers within it, each mixing chamber filled with or containing the stationary phase aqueous solvent. The cocoa-containing sample in the reservoir of the rotor enters one end of the mixing chambers and when the rotor is run or centrifugal force applied, the force allows the cocoa-containing sample to flow through multiple mixing chambers with the mobile phase solvent. As the components of the sample flow through the solvent, the components separate and exit at another end of the mixing chamber. Purified samples can then be collected. This method economically and quickly purifies one procyanidin oligomer in the exemplary range from DP3 to DP12, for example, from the other oligomers of differing DP.

A bridging solvent can be used and selected from those with a polarity between the polarities of the two phases (stationary and mobile). The bridging solvent dissolves partially in one phase as well as partially in the other. Thus, it can be used to modify the properties of both phases. For example, if an alcohol is used as a bridging solvent, the hydrophobic ethyl acetate solvent becomes more polar because it contains some alcohol. Also, the aqueous phase with bridging solvent alcohol becomes more lipophillic and a different range of organic substances can then dissolve in it. Without a bridging solvent, the polarities of the two phases are typically very pronounced such that some components of the sample are almost exclusively found in one or the other phase. This is not an ideal situation for a purification or separation because the components which are in the hydrophobic phase do not partition into the aqueous phase and thus would not be retained during a CPC run.

Accordingly, a bridging solvent can be selected that is preferably one of, or a mixture of one or more of, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and butanol. In general, the bridging solvent can be a C1 to C4 alcohol. The pH constraints imposed by solid supports such as silica and others are not a consideration with CPC. Thus, centrifugal partition chromatographic or liquid-liquid separations may be performed at virtually any pH, and the bridging solvent can also be used with a pH adjusted solvent for this purpose. For example, low pH can be used to preserve procyanidin content during the procedures, such as below pH 6 or at or below pH 4. In particular, the solvents and solutions that contact the procyanidin oligomers can optionally or preferably be maintained between about pH 3 to about pH 6 with an organic acid, with acetic acid being a preferred organic acid. Maintaining this pH range can preserve the levels of procyanidins present during the isolation process.

Purification with the methods of the invention can be combined with one or more additional or supplemental conventional purification procedures, such as solid phase chromatography or HPLC. Also, the method can avoid the use of additional purification procedures, like HPLC. In addition, the methods of the invention can be used to determine the amount of a specific procyanidin oligomer that is present in a particular cocoa sample. Exemplary methods for determining amounts and concentrations include spectroscopy, comparison to standards, and mass spectrometry. Thus, the methods can be used as a quantitative analysis of the procyanidin content of a sample.

As stated, the preferred sample is a cocoa-derived sample, but other plant-based materials can be used, such as apple, grapeseed, grape, pine bark, berries, cinnamon, pomegranate, acai, and other plants known to contain procyanidins or condensed tannins, or samples with detectable or high levels of these or procyanidin compounds. Where the method employs a cocoa-containing or cocoa-derived sample, it can be selected from one or more of chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, cocoa kibble, a cocoa extract, low fat cocoa powder, defatted cocoa powder, and non fat cocoa solids, for example.

The invention also includes a substantially purified procyanidin oligomer and/or a substantially purified chiral oligomer or subsets of specific and/or chiral compounds. For example, a purified composition of one or more procyanidin oligomers DP3 to DP12 that was derived from a cocoa-containing sample can obtained by the methods described here. Also, the purified composition can substantially consist of a single procyanidin oligomer selected from DP4 to DP12, meaning the sample primarily contains only one oligomer or procyanidin when analyzed by HPLC.

In preferred examples, the biphasic solvent mixture is a mixture of ethyl acetate, ethanol, and water, and in most preferred examples these solvents are present at a ratio of 6:1:5 respectively. Multiple FCPC mixing chambers or columns can be used, and the polarity of the biphasic solvent mixture can increase from a first chamber used to the last used. Effectively, and as shown in the data ofFIG. 2, the number of chambers used and the FCPC conditions selected are capable of resolving separate bands for at least each of DP5 through DP9 procyanidin oligomers, or each of DP3 to DP12, or each of DP4 to DP12, or each of DP 4 to DP10, for example.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a process for the production of a non-compressible comestible product comprising xylitol and the comestible product comprising xylitol produced therefrom.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Xylitol is a naturally occurring five carbon sugar alcohol. It occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables and is produced by the human body during normal metabolism. It is a sweet crystalline product, white in color, odorless and soluble in water. In crystalline form, it quickly dissolves in the mouth. It has a negative heat of dissolution, and thereby produces an agreeable refreshing or cooling effect in the mouth.

In addition to its cooling effect, xylitol has interesting sweetening qualities. If one takes sucrose as a reference point, and attributes to it a sweetening value of 1, xylitol is found to have a sweetness of the same order. Thus, xylitol is a sugar substitute. In fact, it has the same sweetness and bulk as sucrose with one third fewer calories (2.4 calories per gram) and no unpleasant after taste. It is currently approved around the world for use in foods, pharmaceuticals and oral hygiene products. For example, xylitol has been widely used in confectionery, baking products, cereals, desserts, jams, beverages, chocolate, chewing gum, gumdrops, and ice cream to name just a few products. It has also been used in the production of oral hygiene products, such as toothpaste and in pharmaceutical products. In addition, it is used as a sucrose substitute placed in foods for consumption by people with diabetes.

Further, xylitol has an interesting property for dental health, in which it differs from other known polyols. It is, in fact, anti-cariogenic, i.e., it cannot serve as a substrate for bacteria present in the mouth cavity. Moreover, it also plays a role in preventing dental caries. It inhibits the growth ofStreptococcus Mutans, the primary bacteria associated with dental caries. Recent interest has increased in xylitol-containing candies because xylitol has been shown to promote remineralization of teeth and damaged tooth enamel. It has also been found that regular use of xylitol can inhibit the transfer of cariogenicStreptococcus Mutansbacteria from mothers to their newborn children. Studies have shown that mothers are the primary source of infection ofStreptococcusin the mouths of newborns and that prevention or delaying colonization by these bacteria leads to significant reduction in tooth decay later in life. In addition, xylitol reduces plaque accumulation and inhibits plaque regrowth.

Further, it also increases salivary flow. Saliva helps clean and protect teeth from decay and this plays a role in repairing the damage caused in the early state of the decay process.

Thus, it is important to have a method of producing products comprising xylitol for use in these various applications.

One such product is a hard candy comprised of xylitol. However, producing a hard candy of xylitol is challenging. It is difficult for xylitol to be made into a hard candy free of crystals because its glass transition is below 32 F (0 C) and at normal household conditions, it would exist as a liquid, although because of its instability, would slowly transform to a few large crystals grown loosely together. Furthermore, as a crystal, it does not compact well.

In addition, in preparing hard candies comprising xylitol, the xylitol is traditionally melted completely to form a molten mass. The molten mass is mechanically agitated or seeded with xylitol crystals to cause crystallization. The resultant seeded mass is then combined in a layered format, wherein an isomalt base is first deposited, then followed by a xylitol layer or the xylitol is codeposited with isomalt in a mold to produce hard candy.

The problem often encountered in this process is that the final product is usually hygroscopic and sticky. Further, the molten mass often manages to crystallize in the machinery and/or equipment, thereby clogging the machinery and/or equipment. Further, once the seed crystals have been added, the viscosity of the seeded molten mass is very difficult to control. Moreover, the product is very temperature sensitive. The seeded mass thickens and crystallizes rapidly if the temperature falls below the melting point of xylitol, and on the other hand, thins, due to melting of the seed crystals if the temperature is raised above the melting point. As a consequence, the viscosity and density of the seeded mass tends to vary upon prolonged exposure to a molten state which is particularly undesirable in deposited hard candy manufacturing lines where any inconsistency of the seeded mass leads to inconsistent piece weight and potential equipment failure. Further, the resultant candy is quite hard, and difficult to bite through.

The present inventors were investigating a new method for producing a hard candy comprising xylitol by modifying the methodology of the prior art. They began preparing the hard candy in a scraped surface heat exchanger, maintaining the temperature at or above the melting point of xylitol. Even though they initially worked with a complete melt, when they lowered the temperature in the scraped surface heat exchanger below the melting point of xylitol, crystals of xylitol began to form in the scraped surface heat exchanger and begin to clog the machine. Once the xylitol recrystallized, it became extremely difficult to work with. The inventors also noted that the product was hard and was not easily bitten into. Moreover, the inventors have confirmed that if the temperature of the emitted scraped surface heat exchanger was too hot, such material was difficult to handle and the product obtained was undesirable.

However, the inventors found that if the xylitol was not completely melted in an extruder, the resulting product was different and was much softer than the product comprising xylitol obtained from completely melting the solid and recrystallizing the melted solid in a scraped surface heat exchanger. Further, in the method found by the present inventors, since the xylitol solid was not being recrystallized, the extruder was no longer getting clogged.

The present invention thus describes this process which overcomes the problems enumerated above and provides a product which has a high flavor impact and a strong cooling sensation. Yet, at the same time, the product that is produced is a soft product that can be easily bitten through.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention, in one embodiment, is directed to a method of producing a solid non-compressible comestible product comprising xylitol, said method comprising:(a) subjecting a composition comprising solid xylitol in an amount ranging from about 60% up to and including 100% by weight to extrusion treatment in an extrusion apparatus under conditions sufficient to partially melt the xylitol in the composition to form a slurry and maintain the composition as a slurry as it passes through and exits the extrusion apparatus,(b) forming the extruded product from step (a) into a desired shape and(c) cooling the product of (b) to form a solid.

The present invention is also directed to the product of the process described hereinabove. In an embodiment, it is a comestible comprising from about 60% to about 100% xylitol, having irregularly shaped crystals, and which, when molded into a yertz shape having a base width of 8.20 mm, a base length of 13.26 mm, a height of 8.71 mm, an angle of 10% between the vertical and the side and having 0.25 mm radius fillet and weighing about 0.75 grams, has a piece break pressure of less than about 110 MPa and a dissolution rate from about 200 to about 400 seconds, said comestible having a moisture content of less than about 1% by weight of the composition, said comestible being substantially free of monosaccharides and disaccharides and maltodextrin having a DE (dextrose equivalent) of less than 20 and sugar alcohols other than xylitol.

"FIELD

The present application is directed toward the field of demulcents and more particularly to comestibles containing demulcents in a form that is not fully hydrated until consumed.

BACKGROUND

When an individual is affected with a sore throat and/or a cough they often seek an item to provide relief. One such item may include a demulcent. Demulcents soothe or soften minor pain and/or inflammation, usually through formation of a film over a mucous membrane.

One type of demulcent includes pectin, which may be delivered in demulcent throat soothers such as hard candy, chewy candy, or gummies. However, current methods for forming throat soothers including pectin or other demulcents require pre-hydration generally involving the addition of water, processing of hydrated pectin granules, and subsequent dehydration. Additionally, current methods of employing pectin for use as a demulcent is believed to rely upon particles 100 microns or larger, which is the size at which pectin is generally commercially available.

What is needed is a comestible containing a demulcent that does not require pre-hydration for item formation, does not contain demulcent particles perceivable by the individual's tongue, and has a rapid hydrolysis resulting in quicker soothing benefits.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to comestibles that contain or have a coating that contains a finely ground demulcent that does not require pre-hydration and that exhibits faster, more complete relief when consumed.

In one embodiment, a comestible comprises a sweetener and demulcent granules having a particle size such that the demulcent is not perceived by the human tongue, wherein the demulcent granules are not fully hydrated.

In one embodiment, the comestible comprises a pressed tablet comprising a sweetener selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, erythritol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol and combinations thereof, and 0.3% to 5% by weight pectin granules having a median particle size less than 50 microns, wherein the pectin granules are not fully hydrated.

Embodiments may employ other types of comestibles, sweeteners, and demulcents all as more fully described herein.

In another embodiment, a method of forming a comestible comprises providing demulcent granules having a maximum average particle size such that the demulcent is not perceived by the human tongue, combining the demulcent granules with a sweetener and processing the sweetener and demulcent granules to form a comestible wherein the processing results in a comestible in which the demulcent granules are not fully hydrated upon formation of the comestible.

Yet another embodiment of the invention is directed to providing the comestibles described herein containing an effective amount of the demulcent granules to provide sore throat relief and in which the demulcent granules become fully hydrated upon ingestion.

An advantage of exemplary embodiments is that the use of a finely ground demulcent allows the inclusion of the delmucent without the need for pre-hydrating it in advance, saving time and costly manufacturing steps associated with subsequent de-hydration.

Another advantage is that when the tablet or other comestible is consumed, the finely ground demulcent hydrates directly in the consumer's mouth.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments that illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.
