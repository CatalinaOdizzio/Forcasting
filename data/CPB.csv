"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to systems and processes suitable for measuring process parameters of process systems, primarily systems for processing food products, making use of application specific integrated circuits identifiable by radio frequency signals.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Most commercially produced, packaged foods (including beverages) go through a thermal process to render that particular food safe for consumption. The intensity of this thermal process varies depending on the physical characteristics and chemical composition of the food, the type of packaging, and the shelf life desired. Thermal treatment can be achieved either prior to or after filling the product into the package. For example, low acid foods where product is thermally processed prior to filling into the package can employ vastly different processing systems as compared to product that is thermally processed in-package.

To render a thermally processed food product safe for consumption, the manufacturer needs to know how much heat is applied to the product. This heat treatment can be observed as a function of temperature and time. Product temperature is heated to a certain degree and held at-least this temperature for a prescribed amount of time, thus corresponding to a “lethality” value which is conventionally used in the food industry to standardize and quantify the intensity of a thermal process. With pure liquid foods, such as beverages and broths, the temperature of the product can be measured easily by temperature probes at prescribed locations in a process system. The use of conventional temperature probes, however, is not preferred and is in practice almost impossible when temperature is desired to be measured within particulate foods (i.e., liquid foods with native constituent particles) such as soups. In these circumstances, only the liquid fraction of the particulate food can be monitored for temperature by the use of conventional temperature probes. A distinct challenge arises when temperature measurements of the different native constituent particles in the foods are desired.

In any sterilization process, the goal is to ensure commercial sterility in the product as a whole. When the product is comprised of a homogeneous liquid fraction, measurement can be facilitated by use of conventional temperature probes. On the contrary, when the product is comprised of several different particles suspended in a liquid fraction, such as in a garnished soup, it can be extremely difficult to predict sterility in the product as a whole based on the process data that is readily available in a conventional continuous flow sterilization system. The difficulty arises from the fact that different particle types in the product may heat up differently from the liquid stream, thus abrogating the utility and veracity of temperature probe measurements of the liquid faction as an indicator of particle temperature. Particle residence time distribution in the process system adds to the complexity of ensuring commercial sterility of all components.

Batch blending of products in a kettle or ribbon blender, for example, for soup products containing large particulates, can result in particle distribution issues for several reasons, including insufficient blending time, inappropriate agitator design, inappropriate agitator speed or direction, kettle size and shape, garnish level and size, overall liquid amount, particle density, and liquid viscosity. It can, therefore, be difficult to measure a variety of process conditions of interest such as, for example, the direction, orientation, speed, or temperature of a particle in a mixing vessel. Indeed, direct particle temperature measurement using conventional techniques, such as temperature probes, would be significantly challenged, if at all possible, by the movement of particles during such unit operation. It is, therefore, desirable to further optimize such batch process conditions.

Generally speaking, the temperature of a single particle may not be uniform throughout the whole volume of that particle. For example, the outer surface of the particle can heat faster than the core of the particle because the outer surface of the particle is in direct contact with the liquid fraction. Although this is the case for some conventional operations, where either hot water or steam is used as the heating medium, it may not be the case for thermal operations where the food is heated by other means such as infra-red, microwave, direct solar heating, radiation heating, inductive heating, or resistive heating. In addition to temperature variation within the volume of a single particle, different types of particles will flow at different speeds within the liquid fraction as the entire food volume is being pumped through the process system. The particles that flow faster through the system will be subject to the heat treatment for less time.

Aseptic thermal processing generally involves continuous sterilization of the food material using a suitable heat exchanger. The type of heat exchanger used is dictated by properties of the food material such as, for example, viscosity, particle size, and homogeneity. Some food products, such as juice, milk, and broth are homogeneous products and can be processed in plate heat exchangers. Other food products, such as soups having solid particles, can be processed in heat exchangers that can handle particles, such as tubular heat exchangers. To be able to quantify the thermal process for an aseptic operation, one would need to be able to identify the slowest heating particle at its core by assessing known characteristics of the particles, such as size, thermal conductivity, or density. Once the slowest heating particle has been identified, the temperature of this particle (at its coldest spot) can be known at the entrance and exit of the holding tubes associated with the heating system being used, to ensure proper thermal treatment as measured by a variety of decisional factors such as cook-value, lethality, etc. Currently, the art lacks a system that can monitor process conditions, such as direct temperature of the particles, in at least near real time during a continuous flow thermal treatment.

Food scientists and engineers have been experimenting with various technologies to quantify and validate food manufacturing processes. These conventional attempts can generally be classified in two categories, residence time distribution of different particle components and temperature data of the particle components at critical locations in the system.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,282 to Grabowski et al., for example, discloses the use of implanted radio frequency transponders (in the form of RFID chips) to identify the residence times of simulated particles passing through a continuous processing system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,979 to Arndt et al. discloses the use of dipole antenna marker implants in the particles and microwave transducer detectors to measure particle residence times. Systems such as these, however, do not provide information pertaining to the temperature of the particles of interest, and cannot provide pertinent temperature process information relating to the slowest heating, fastest moving particle(s) of a system.

Further conventional attempts have been made to either measure only temperature or both temperature and residence time of food particles in a continuous processing system. Magnetic resonance imaging thermometry, such as that disclosed by Kantt et al., “Temperature Mapping of Particles During Aseptic Processing with Magnetic Resonance Imaging”, Journal of Food Science, Volume 63, No. 2 (1998), is a non-obstructing and non-contact method, but is not sufficiently rapid enough to provide in-line real time measurement. Eight seconds were taken to image a single 64×64 cross-sectional temperature map. During this time, however, a considerable quantity of product can pass the detector unmonitored. Thus, the number of cross sections that can be observed is very limited, i.e., the detection of the initial location where the lethal thermal treatment is achieved may not be determined for all possible cases.

Other conventional methodologies, with associated shortcomings, include those implementing thermoresistive implants. One such example of this is the local magnetic temperature measurement approach disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,317 to Ghiron et al., which is directed to the use of spherical paramagnetic particles for implants and detector coils around the pipes for sensors. This approach then implements a correlation between falling magnetic field strength and temperature increase to calculate the implant temperature from the signals of three sensor coils. However, the negative correlation between the measured magnetic field and the increasing temperature employed by this approach can cause a non-conservative temperature estimation, i.e., the resulting calculation can indicate a higher temperature than is actually present in the implant. This is due to the fact that magnetic field reduction can be caused by a variety of factors other than temperature increase in the implant, such as obstruction of detection by other materials (e.g., other food particles that are present). Still further, the magnetic thermometry approach can be highly susceptible to electro-magnetic interference, thereby greatly increasing the complexity of data collection or veracity of the collected data.

Another methodology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,954 to Palazoglu et al., which makes use of the change in the magnetic field strength of two or more magnets attached to each other along the same pole and which are secured in a carrier particle which emulates the properties of a real food particle. The magnets are placed in simple, forced attachment using an adhesive having a specific release temperature. When the adhesive melts, at a prescribed threshold temperature, at least one of the magnets rotates to the opposite pole, thereby creating a detectable change in the magnetic field. The location in the processing system where this change in the magnetic field is detected, for a given magnet pair, is assumed to be the location where the simulated particle temperature reaches the threshold temperature. The shortcoming of this methodology is that similar to the method disclosed by Ghiron et al., a direct temperature measurement is not provided. Rather, only an indirect indication of temperature is provided. Further, the resulting indication of temperature is simply one of being above the predetermined threshold temperature of the adhesive, rather than a direct numerical temperature value. Further, there is not a way of uniquely identifying a magnet pair when multiple magnet pairs are introduced into the system at the same time.

Therefore, there is a need in the art for systems and methods for directly monitoring the particulate temperature of thermally treated heterogeneous fluids having a plurality of constituent food particles.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, methods and apparatuses are disclosed which use application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) to provide process-related data for batch or continuous thermal treatments, such as particulate food sterilization, pasteurization, and/or preservation processes. The circuits are preferably embedded in a particle subjected to such treatment, and methods are described for providing at least near real-time process control derived from process data provided by the circuits while subjected to such treatment.

A preferred system for monitoring process conditions of a batch or continuous thermal treatment uses at least one application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) identifiable by radio frequency signal, coupled with at least one sensor capable of measuring at least one process condition. The system further has at least one transceiver capable of communication with the circuit and at least one particle embedded with the circuit. The particle passes within a heterogeneous fluid having a plurality of constituent food particles subjected to direct thermal treatment, indirect thermal treatment, or other food processing treatments. Aseptic processes or non-aseptic processes can be employed, where appropriate. The circuit-embedded particle can be an actual constituent particle or a particle that simulates any number of constituent particle properties.

Some currently preferred systems utilize a circuit placed within a native constituent particle. Other currently preferred systems utilize a circuit placed within a simulated particle for passing through the continuous processing system. Such circuits can be exposed at the surface of the particle, or can be positioned within the particle, preferably at least near the center of the particle, so that the particle emulates at least one physical, thermal, or dielectric characteristic of a native constituent particle.

Physical characteristics of interest can include, without limitation, moisture content, salt content, shape, and/or density. Dielectric properties can include, by way of example only, electric conductivity, magnetic permeability, relative dielectric constant, relative dielectric loss factor, and/or dielectric loss angle.

Other preferred methods further include a data logging system for measuring and storing information pertaining to at least one process condition, as measured by at least one circuit-embedded particle. Such data logging can be along at least a portion of the process path, at-least one discrete location along the process path, or both. Accordingly, such data logging can be continuous, intermittent or combinations of both.

Process conditions which can be measured using such a system can include, by way of example but without limitation, liquid pH, particulate temperature, liquid temperature, particulate speed, particulate location, particulate rotation, liquid speed, liquid nutrient characteristics, chemical characteristics, system pressure, particulate orientation, particulate position, and/or liquid salinity. Nutrient measurement can, for example, identify the amounts, concentrations, or ratios of sugar, protein, starch, and/or various vitamins or minerals that may be present in the liquid fraction of the heterogeneous fluid. Nutrient measurement can further include identifying the amounts, concentrations or ratios of various phytochemicals such as, but not limited to, phytosterols, carotenoids, tocotrienols, isoflavones, omega-3 fatty acids, phospholipids, nucleosides, nucleotides, glucosamine, ferulic acid, and/or coumaric acid.

Particulate or liquid temperature measurements can be made from about −40° C. to about 200° C., preferably between 100° C. to 140° C. Preferred systems can measure temperature with an accuracy of 1° C. System pressure measurements can be made up to 1 kpsi, preferably up to 150 kpsi.

Yet another preferred method of measuring process conditions uses at least one application specific integrated circuit identifiable by radio frequency signal having at least one sensor capable of measuring at least one process condition, providing the application specific integrated circuit in a heterogeneous fluid, and measuring at least one process condition as determined by the circuit at-least one location within the process system. The location lies along at least a portion of the length of the process path, at a discrete cross-section of the process path which is subject to a transceiver, or both. In this way, for example, particulate orientation, particulate position, or both, can be measured relative to the process space.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to instant food systems, components thereof, and methods regarding the same.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Food products that can be quickly prepared for serving with a minimum of effort (instant food product) have become popular in various settings including the home, cafeterias, and restaurants. Instant food products are quite varied and can include items served hot, cold, or at room temperature. Some instant food products are kept frozen and then thawed and/or cooked prior to serving. Others are shelf stable at room temperature by virtue of their packaging and/or the use of preservatives and relatively little needs to be done before serving them. Still others are provided in a dehydrated format and either consumed in a dehydrated condition or they are hydrated before serving.

While instant food products have found success because of their convenience, not all instant food products have achieved high marks for organoleptic properties. As such, improvement of the organoleptic properties of instant food products has been an area of continued work.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of Invention

This invention relates to products and methods for heating comestibles. More particularly, this invention relates to containers and packages that may be used to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles, e.g., in combination microwave and convection ovens.

2. Description of Related Art

Soups, sauces, chilis, and other such liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles are often served in eating establishments, e.g., restaurants and cafeterias. Many eating establishments, especially quick service restaurants (QSR), do not prepare such foods from scratch. Rather, eating establishments often heat up ready-made liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles that were previously prepared and cooked by comestible manufacturers. These comestibles are often packaged and stored at room temperature or are refrigerated or frozen until they are ready to be heated and served.

Eating establishments may use any of a number of different modalities to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. For example, large amounts of soup are often heated at one time in a large pot on a stove or warmer and then transferred to soup bowls, one serving at a time. However, heating a large amount of soup takes a long time. Often, the soup is maintained at a hot temperature for hours until all of it is served or any remaining portion is disposed of. The result is an over-cooked product, much of which goes to waste. In addition, the pot, utensils and soup bowls (unless disposable) will need to be cleaned after use. While microwave ovens may be used to heat such comestibles, a significant number of eating establishments, especially in the QSR segment, do not have microwave ovens.

Increasingly, eating establishments are using combination microwave and convection ovens, such as those sold under the trademark TURBOCHEF®, to cook or reheat essentially solid comestibles. Combination microwave and convection ovens use both microwave energy and convection heating to enable rapid and convenient cooking and heating of comestibles. For example, such ovens can quickly warm hoagies and grinders, leaving the bread crispy rather than soft or soggy, as would be the likely result using a microwave oven alone.

Notwithstanding their increasing popularity in eating establishments, combination microwave and convection ovens are not used to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles because there are currently no feasible means to do so, especially in the QSR setting. Typical microwaveable cookware, such as ceramics, glass, PYREX®, foams, ovenable plastics, or ovenable paper/paperboard, are not practical and in some cases unsuitable for heating soups and the like in combination microwave and convection ovens. Disposable containers made from ovenable paper/paperboard, ovenable plastic and foam can only be used in ambient temperatures of up to about 400° F. Those materials will melt or burn if subjected to the ambient environment of a combination microwave and convection oven, which typically holds at 480° F. or above all day in an eating establishment (especially in a QSR). Thus, while disposable materials are convenient in that they allow for little to no cleanup after use, currently available disposable containers are unfit for direct use in combination microwave and convection ovens.

Ceramics, glass and PYREX®, on the other hand, can withstand ambient temperatures in a combination microwave and convection oven. However, those materials retain a significant amount of heat. Consequently, they can be extremely hot to the touch. In addition, heating comestibles directly in containers made from such reusable materials would require that the containers be cleaned after use. Accordingly, ceramic, glass and PYREX® cookware are inconvenient for an operator to use for heating soups and the like in combination microwave and convection ovens, especially in a QSR setting, where the operator works under tight time constraints. Also, heating soup and the like directly in ceramic, glass or PYREX® cookware in a combination microwave and convection oven can burn or scorch the soup due to the extremely high temperatures in such an oven. Thus, ceramic, glass and PYREX® cookware are not feasible options for an operator, especially in a QSR setting, to deliver a quality product with convenience and speed using a combination microwave and convection oven.

In short, many eating establishments have combination microwave and convection ovens and serve hot liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. But such eating establishments tend not to use such ovens to heat such comestibles because there are no practical and disposable means to do so. This is indeed surprising, considering that combination microwave and convection ovens have been commercially available for many years and have greatly increased in popularity in recent years. Accordingly, there is a need for practical systems and methods that enable liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles to be heated in combination microwave and convection ovens. Such systems and methods should enable rapid and substantially uniform heating of the comestible in a manner that is convenient and would require little to no cleanup. Preferably, such systems and methods would be used for heating single-serving packages of liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. More preferably, such systems and methods would provide thermal protection to a single-serve comestible-containing disposable package so that the package can withstand the high ambient temperatures (e.g., 480° F. to 540° F.) in a combination microwave and convection oven.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, there is provided a system for heating a comestible. The system includes a container and a flexible vented package containing a liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestible. The package is positioned within the container in a manner that hinders the comestible from escaping through the package's vent(s). The container is penetrable to microwaves and is adapted to not experience heat-induced damage when subjected to a heating cycle in a combination microwave and convection oven. The container is adapted to protect the package from heat-induced damage when the container is subjected to a heating cycle in a combination microwave and convection oven.

In another aspect, there is provided a method of heating a comestible. The method includes subjecting a system to a combination microwave and convection oven heating cycle to heat contents within the system. The system includes a closed container and a flexible package containing a comestible. The package is located within the container. The container is penetrable by microwaves and prevents heat-induced damage to the package during the heating cycle.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to apparatus for filling containers and related methods. More specifically, the present invention relates to rotary filling apparatus and related methods.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Containers of various sorts including bottles and cans and jars, etc., are commonly filled with liquid type products in a production line by a rotary type piston filling machines. In general, containers arrive on a conveyor line and are successively applied onto a turret in underlying relation with a revolving piston type filler. The filler has a piston moving in an upright cylinder, and the piston is reciprocated upwardly and downwardly during revolving of the filler and turret so that the liquid product is drawn into the piston and is subsequently expelled from the piston into the container being filled. The amount of liquid product that is supplied into the container in the filling operation is measured by the magnitude of the piston movement in the cylinder, and the size of the cylinder.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the invention include apparatus for filling containers and related methods. In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, a filler plenum assembly, piston assemblies, a cam track, and a fluid supply group. The rotary turret assembly can include a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns. The plurality of hollow columns can be mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The piston assemblies can move up and down within the plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can further include a cam contact member. Rotation of the rotary turret assembly causes the cam contact member to move over a surface of the cam track causing vertical movement of the piston assemblies relative to the plurality of hollow columns.

In various embodiments the cam track can include a first rising portion, a second rising portion, a first declining portion, a first flat portion, and a second declining portion. The first rising portion can correspond to a filling phase. The second rising portion can correspond to an overfilling phase. The first declining portion can correspond to a purging phase. The first flat portion can correspond to a hold phase. The second declining portion can correspond to a dispensing phase.

In an embodiment, the invention includes a method for filling containers. The method for filling containers can include rotating a rotary turret assembly, the rotary turret assembly comprising a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The method can further include contacting a cam contact member against a cam track to cause piston assemblies disposed within the hollow columns to move up and down, drawing a food material into a bottom portion of the hollow columns when the piston assemblies move up. The method can further include dispensing the food material into a container when the piston assemblies move down. In various embodiments, the amount of the food material drawn into the hollow column exceeds the amount ultimately dispensed into the container.

In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, a filler plenum assembly, piston assemblies, a sensor, a lever actuator, a cam track, and a fluid supply group. The rotary turret assembly can include a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can move up and down within the plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can include a piston body and a top hat assembly. The top hat assembly can include a cam contact member and a release lever.

The top hat assembly can be configured to releasably engage the top of the piston body. The release lever can allow the piston body and the top hat assembly to release from one another when the release lever is engaged. The sensor can detect the presence or absence of a container to be filled. The lever actuator can be configured to contact the release lever when the sensor indicates that a container to be filled is absent. Upon rotation of the rotary turret assembly, the cam contact member moves over a surface of the cam track. However, because the cam contact member is operably connected to the top hat assembly, rotation of the rotary turret assembly only causes vertical movement of the piston body only if the top hat assembly is connected to the piston body.

In an embodiment, the invention includes a method for filling containers. The method for filling containers can include rotating a rotary turret assembly, the rotary turret assembly comprising a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The method can further include detecting whether a container to be filled is aligned with a particular hollow column and engaging a release lever that allows a top hat assembly to release from a piston body assembly if a container is not detected. The method can further include contacting a cam contact member operably connected to the top hat assembly against a cam track to cause the top hat assembly disposed within the hollow columns to move up and down. The method can further include drawing a food material into a bottom portion of the hollow columns when the piston body assemblies move up if the top hat assembly is not released from the piston body assembly. The method can also include dispensing the food material into a container when the piston body assemblies move down if the top hat assembly is not released from the piston body assembly.

In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, and a container conveyor system. The container conveyor system can be for supplying empty containers to the rotary turret assembly and conveying filled containers away from the rotary turret assembly. The container conveyor system can include an infeed timing screw, a discharge timing screw, and a container elevation system. The container elevation system can be used to raise or lower at least a portion of a track or rail so that the top height of the containers (such as cans) can be adjusted to be the correct height for the rotary turret assembly. The container elevation system can include a rail brace and a brace actuator. The brace actuator can be used to raise or lower the height of the rail brace. A rail can be mounted on or adjacent to the rail brace. The containers to be filled can move along the rail. In some embodiments, the container elevation system can be disposed under a portion of the infeed timing screw and the discharge timing screw.

In an embodiment, the invention includes a method for filling containers. The method for filling containers can include rotating a rotary turret assembly, the rotary turret assembly comprising a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The method can further include feeding containers to be filled into an infeed timing screw, passing the containers over a container rail, wherein the container rail is disposed adjacent the infeed timing screw, adjusting the height of the containers and container rail relative to the rotary turret.

In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, a filler plenum assembly, and a fluid supply group. The filler plenum assembly can include a plenum. The fluid supply group can include a liquid supply tank, a supply conduit, a reclaim trough, a reclaim conduit, a pump, a plenum return conduit, and a pumped return conduit. The filler plenum assembly can be underlying a portion of the rotary turret assembly. The plenum can be in fluid communication with the plurality of hollow columns for a portion of each rotation of the rotary turret assembly. The fluid supply group can be in fluid communication with the plenum. The supply conduit can provide fluid communication between the liquid supply tank and the plenum. The reclaim trough can be adjacent to the plenum. The reclaim conduit can provide fluid communication between the reclaim trough and the pump. The plenum return conduit can provide fluid communication between the plenum outlet and the pump. The pumped return conduit can provide fluid communication between the pump and the liquid supply tank.

The components of the fluid supply group can provide for a closed circuit fluid supply in that food materials can pass from the liquid supply tank through the supply conduit to the plenum. Food materials that are not drawn into the hollow columns of the rotary turret assembly can then pass out of the plenum through a plenum return conduit to a pump. Also, in some embodiments, food materials recovered through a reclaim trough can pass through a reclaim conduit to the pump. The pump can cause the food material to pass through a pumped return conduit back to the liquid supply tank either directly or indirectly. In some embodiments, this circuit can be operative even when the rotary turret is not rotating and filling containers such that food material can be recirculated and kept in proper condition for being filled into containers during temporary stoppages of the rotary turret.

In an embodiment, the invention includes a method for filling containers. The method for filling containers can include rotating a rotary turret assembly, the rotary turret assembly comprising a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The method can further include delivering a food product to a plenum disposed under a portion of the rotary turret assembly by conveying the food product from a liquid supply tank through a supply conduit to the plenum. The method can further include drawing a first portion of the food product from the plenum into the hollow columns for dispensing into containers to be filled. The method can further include collecting a second portion of the food product disposed in the plenum and conveying the collected food product through an outlet in the plenum and to a pump. The method can further include conveying the collected food product from the pump back to the liquid supply tank.
