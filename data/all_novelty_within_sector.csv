"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to novel methods for manipulating protein and polysaccharide/starch components of food products or ingredients, and in particular cocoa-containing products, as a food ingredient and as a final food product. In one aspect, the invention encompasses a chocolate composition comprising a gel network formed by cocoa starches and/or proteins, or milk proteins and cocoa solids, and also comprising crystallized cocoa butter as a dispersed component, and water or milk or skim milk as the continuous phase or aqueous phase of a suspension. Previously, chocolate compositions employed cocoa butter as the continuous phase in compositions and suspensions, generally with sugar, milk solids and cocoa solids as the dispersed phase. Both liquid cocoa compositions and solid compositions traditionally follow this standard. The compositions, products, and ingredients possible according to the invention, however, can utilize the gel forming potential of starch and protein components of cocoa ingredients and/or other ingredients to create a wide range of oil-in-water suspensions with advantageous properties. For example, recipes for a low or reduced calorie chocolate product or ingredient having the same cocoa content as conventional chocolate and/or falling within the standard of identity for chocolate products can be designed. In addition, the production and packaging options for chocolate products are expanded by the use of the invention as the viscosity of the chocolate product or ingredient can be varied easily without specific reliance on cocoa butter content.

DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Chocolate products and ingredients conventionally exist as suspensions, with fat or oil as the continuous phase. Polymorphic crystals of cocoa butter form an important part of the fine structure of these suspensions and the methods to control crystallization of cocoa butter are well known. In general, the setting of cocoa butter crystals into the most stable form is desirable. The failure to account for the difference in forms within the fat suspension can result in poor color and blooming.

From a production point of view, cocoa butter content has been changed to vary the viscosity of chocolate compositions, so that higher cocoa butter content results in a more viscous final product or ingredient. While heating may be used to increase flowability or solubility of certain ingredients in chocolate processing or packaging, heating is not used as a method to change the properties of cocoa-containing compositions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a food product or ingredient having a crystallized and gelatinized structure in an oil-in-water suspension. The combination of a gelatinized structure, a crystallized structure, and an oil-in-water suspension made possible and demonstrated by the methods, food products and ingredients of the invention provide numerous advantages in the food processing field. For example, the invention provides products with improved viscosity characteristics over a greater range of temperatures and allows sugar free or low or reduced calorie products to be produced while maintaining other desirable characteristics, such as texture, taste, mouthfeel, and viscosity. Furthermore, the invention can be said to incorporate methods and ingredients, or more particularly moisture levels, that standard practices report as inappropriate or undesirable in the chocolate manufacturing field. For example, Beckett (Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use, 3d Ed., Beckett ed., 1999 Blackwell Science Ltd., see Chaps. 9 and 20 in particular) notes that it is necessary to remove moisture during processing of chocolate to avoid the requirement to use additional fat and to avoid or minimize the possibility of microbial growth. In addition, Minifie (Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d Ed., 1999, Aspen Publishing, see Chap. 5 in particular) notes the importance of minimizing the introduction of water in chocolate processing in order to maintain a desired viscosity. Thus, in one aspect, by using water or water-based solutions as the aqueous phase in an oil-in-water solution for cocoa and/or chocolate food ingredients or products, the invention utilizes counter-intuitive methods and ingredients as compared to typical chocolate product and ingredient manufacturing.

In one embodiment, the food ingredient comprises an oil or fat phase comprising at least about 2% or at least about 3% cocoa solids and at least about 2% or at least about 3% cocoa butter, the cocoa solids being in suspension and/or at least partially crystallized in the final ingredient or product at room temperature. In various embodiments involving cocoa or chocolate, the cocoa butter and cocoa solids content from one or more of a variety of added cocoa-containing products can be selected to generate a range of final weight percent values, including from about 2% to about 3% cocoa butter, about 3% to about 5% cocoa butter, about 5% to 10% or higher cocoa butter, and about 2% to about 3% cocoa solids, about 3% to about 5% cocoa solids, and about 5% to 10% or higher cocoa solids, and any combination of these ranges. In one aspect, the invention does not encompass prior or conventional chocolate milk mixtures that do not possess or are not treated to generate a gelatinized and/or oil-in-water suspension as described here. Generally, prior chocolate milk mixtures do not form stable suspensions, as one of skill in the art understands.

The food ingredients or products of the invention or used in the invention are not limited to any particular state or temperature, for example room temperature. The reference to crystallized or partially crystallized structures at room temperature means the food ingredient or product is capable of exhibiting a crystallized or partially crystallized structure or microstructure when at room temperature. Thus, in part, the suspension has a crystallized structure. The food ingredient further comprises an aqueous phase comprising water or milk or skim milk, such as a composition of at least about 5% milk solids and at least about 5% nutritive carbohydrate sweetener. The soluble starches or polysaccharides and protein present in at least the cocoa solids, or other cocoa product, are capable of forming a gel network in the suspension. Thus, in part, the suspension has a gelatinized structure. The insoluble particles from at least the cocoa, such as the cocoa cell wall materials, are dispersed within the gel network forming part of the suspension. While cocoa-containing compositions are routinely referred to, the invention is not limited to cocoa-containing compositions. Other food ingredients or edible compositions can be used.

In a specific embodiment, the food ingredient of the invention has at least about 15%, or at least about 18%, or at least about 20% cocoa solids by weight in its final ingredient form or product form. Thus, the methods and ingredients and products of the invention can be used in the production of various chocolate products that fall within the standard of identity for chocolate, milk chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, and white chocolate that may exist in a desired market or under a particular regulatory setting. Furthermore, artificial or non-nutritive sweeteners can be used in conjunction with the invention to produce low calorie or low carbohydrate products or sugar free products. Also, vitamin and/or mineral food additives can be optionally added to improve the nutritional content of chocolate or cocoa-containing foods, for example.

In another aspect, the invention comprises a method of making a food ingredient where a fat or oil phase composition comprising cocoa butter, milk fat and/or other edible fat, and optionally an emulsifier, is mixed with an aqueous or continuous phase comprising water or milk. The mixing can be performed by a variety of methods known to the food and food ingredient industries, and specifically includes homogenizer, dynamic mixer, or static mixer processes. After preparing the oil-in-water suspension, the mixture of the oil or fat phase with the aqueous or continuous phase can be heated under conditions where the protein and starch components of the cocoa solids produce a gel network. In general terms, the gel network is functionally a gelatinized composition having an increased viscosity compared to its pre-treatment or pre-heated form. It can be prepared from biopolymer-containing components, such as protein and/or carbohydrate containing components, particularly cocoa products such as cocoa solids and milk products such as milk solids. One of skill in the art is familiar with methods and equipment for measuring the viscosity of compositions, including the compositions noted here. Without limiting the invention to any particular mechanism, the protein and/or soluble carbohydrate or starch components in a composition of food ingredients, such as a cocoa-containing composition, can be effectively swelled or water-saturated by particular treatments or heating processes depending on the components of the composition. In preferred treatments, the gel network formation occurs efficiently by heating to a range between about 52° C. to about 68° C. for cocoa-containing compositions. Gel network formation in the same cocoa-containing compositions can also occur through prolonged standing, with or without mechanical shearing. Functionally, the treating or heating step should disrupt the native protein conformation and/or swell carbohydrate or starch or biopolymer components from their existing state in order to form a gel network. Since the swelling of cocoa product components can take long periods of time and/or employ mechanical treatments, the preferred method of preparing a gel network according to this invention is by heating.

In the photomicrographs ofFIGS. 5 and 6, one can see the difference between the treated or heated cocoa components and the same components after conventional cocoa processing. In general, the methods of the invention allow for a microstructure of cocoa-containing compositions or suspensions where the cocoa butter droplets can be from about 0.5 to about 100 microns in diameter, or more preferably about 0.5 to about 30 microns in diameter. Furthermore, the carbohydrate or starch components of the cocoa products used or the cell components from the cocoa products used are visibly swelled in the methods and products of the invention (seeFIG. 6), while in the conventional dark chocolate composition ofFIG. 5, by comparison, they are typically present as crystallized and/or amorphous components in the suspension. In addition, the sugar in the suspension ofFIG. 6is dissolved in the continuous phase rather than in crystalline structures as shown in the conventional composition ofFIG. 5, thus leading to a more uniform and smoother texture.

In another aspect, the invention provides a novel oil-in-water suspension at temperatures below the melting point of the cocoa butter in a cocoa butter containing composition. In this and other aspects of the invention, cocoa butter is discussed as part of the fat or oil phase. However, other cocoa containing products can be used, such as cocoa liquor or cocoa powder. In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art is familiar with adding emulsifiers and/or hydrocolloids and/or other biopolymers to cocoa products, and emulsifiers and hydrocolloids and protein and starch compositions can optionally be added or replaced by cocoa butter in the food ingredients, products and compositions of the invention. Beyond cocoa butter or other cocoa products, additional fat components can be added in the methods to produce the food ingredients or products of the invention, especially including those with a melting point above room temperature or at or above about 25° C. or at or above about 35° C. As shown below, fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil, or cocoa butter substitute, for example, can be used as an edible oil with a melting point above room temperature.

In particular aspects, the invention includes processing a food ingredient into a processed product or composition. The processed products or compositions can be prepared by any method of the food and confectionary industry. For example, in-process steps can include adding components, such as adding vitamins, minerals, food grade gas, and one or more of the variety of ingredients available. Processing can also or in addition involve producing a marketable food product by coating, forming, molding, extruding, enrobing, injecting, baking, freezing, packaging, layering, rolling, cutting, depositing, panning, casting, or any other available method (see, for example, Minifie, “Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery,” 3d ed., Aspen Publishers). Additionally, filtration or separation processes can be included to, for example, remove substantially all insoluble particles from an ingredient or food product.

As noted above, the preferred process for forming a gel network is heating. For the cocoa product containing compositions, heating the mixed oil and aqueous phases can comprise heating to about 121° C. for about 8.5 minutes, or to about 150° C. for at least about 4 seconds, or simply heating to about 68° C. for a period of time sufficient to form a gel network. In general, for cocoa containing products, cocoa starch can be formed into a gel network if it is subjected to a temperature of about 52° C. to about 68° C., so any heating process that results in the cocoa starch reaching this temperature should suffice. Other, lower temperatures can also be selected and used if longer periods of time are employed. The higher temperatures noted here can be used in optional processing methods or optional sterilizing methods. Other methods include allowing the mixture to rest at room temperature for a period of time sufficient to form a gel network, or using high shear conditions, for example with a high pressure homogenizer.

In some of the many possible food products that can be produced, the food ingredient of the invention can be further processed into a product containing milk chocolate, sweet chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semisweet chocolate, or white chocolate. In addition, the product can comprise one or more of chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, heavy cream, anhydrous milk fat, whey protein concentrates, non-fat milk protein, whole milk powder, sugar, lecithin, vanillin, and skim milk, as shown in the examples below.

In a more general aspect, the invention involves preparing an oil-in-water suspension using one or more cocoa containing products. The cocoa containing products are those processed from, or some degree of processed form of, the cacao bean that are commonly available. As noted above, certain microstructure environments can be created using the protein and starch components from the cacao bean products. While the production of oil-in-water emulsions in chemical processes is not new, the use of oil-in-water suspensions for cocoa containing products in particular, and food products more generally, is not common. In addition, the use of oil-in-water suspensions for chocolate products falling under one or more of the many standards or identity for these products has not been described previously. In another general aspect, the invention comprises preparing an edible gelatinized and crystallized microstructure within an oil-in-water suspension by using a gel network forming biopolymer containing product, such as a cocoa product, a fruit product, a berry product, or a vegetable product. A gel network-forming amount of a biopolymer is used and the suspension comprises an aqueous phase and a dispersed oil or fat phase, wherein the gel network is capable of being formed from the biopolymer after heating the suspension, and the components of the oil or fat phase are at least partially crystallized at room temperature and stably present in the suspension. By the phrase “stably present in suspension,” the components of the suspension remain substantially in suspension for a period of up to 3 months, or up to 6 months, or up to 8 months, or up to 12 months, or up to 18 months, or up to 24 months or longer. The microstructures of the dispersed phase can be selected to have a size of about 100 um or less in diameter while in the suspension. The food ingredient made from these suspensions can have a biopolymer originally provided in the form of a cocoa containing product, a fruit containing product, a berry containing product, or other similar product, or even a hydrocolloid containing product. This food ingredient can also or alternatively comprise a component in the oil or fat phase that is at least partially crystallized at room temperature and can be selected from one of more of cocoa butter, fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cottonseed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil, 17-sterine, cocoa butter substitutes or equivalents, milk fat, or any oil or fat that is at least partially solid or crystallized at room temperature, or about 20° C., or about 25° C., or about 30° C. In addition, the invention specifically includes a final food product that comprises any of the food ingredients noted or any food ingredient produced by a method noted throughout this disclosure.

As discussed here, the oil-in-water suspension refers to a suspension of, for example, oil droplets and/or insoluble particles in a continuous medium or phase, whereas in an emulsion, by contrast, all components are dissolved in the continuous phase. In general for the food rheology field, a suspension is at least one solid dispersed within a continuous phase, where the continuous phase is at least one liquid (see, for example, Van Nostrand's Scientific Encyclopedia, D. Van Nostrand Co., Inc., Princeton, N.J., 4thed. 1968, pp. 620 and 1782; Rheologie der Lebensmittel, Weipert/Tscheuschner/Windhab, Behr's Verlag, Hamburg, Germany, 1993, pp. 108 and 122). The edible oil-in-water suspension of this invention refers to a dispersed phase of oil droplets and insoluble particles that are suspended in a substantially stably manner within an aqueous continuous phase, whereas in an emulsion all of the dispersed phase components must be liquid and are merely mixed in the continuous phase and are not, generally, stably suspended. Furthermore, emulsions do not necessarily employ the gel network as mentioned here. In fact, there are no reports of cocoa-based gel networks used to produce edible oil-in-water suspensions as described here. Thus, in general, the suspensions of the inventions comprise a dispersion of crystalline and/or non-soluble droplets and/or particles dispersed in a gel network or gelatinized continuous aqueous phase. While cocoa-based oil-in-water suspensions are noted as a preferred embodiment, other biopolymer-containing compositions can be used also.

In one aspect of a method of producing a cocoa-based oil-in-water suspension, the method involves mixing a fat phase comprising one or more cocoa products, including cocoa butter, and having cocoa protein and/or starch or carbohydrate components, with an aqueous phase. In preferred embodiments, the final non-fat cocoa solids content is at least about 2% or about 3% or about 4% or more by weight of the final suspension. Also in preferred embodiments, the aqueous phase comprises water, a sugar or sweetener or both, and/or milk and/or skim milk and/or cream. Other liquids or solutions can also be used as the aqueous phase and the invention specifically includes chocolate or cocoa compositions prepared without milk or milk products, even chocolate or cocoa beverages without milk. Once mixed, a swelling or heating step occurs to form a gel network comprised of cocoa proteins and cocoa starch components. The formation of a gel network can be detected by a variety of methods known in the art, including microscopy, direct viscosity measurements, ultrasonic methods, and light scattering methods. If a viscosity measurement is used, one preferred detectable change is where the viscosity of the suspension increases after heating when measured as shear rate. More particularly, the viscosity increase is at least about two-fold or double in the measurable 30 sec-1 shear rate. If microscopy is used, one of skill in the art can measure gel formation by the effects on the final suspension and the appearance of component parts within the suspension. For example, starch granules in cocoa-containing compositions can be visualized prior to swelling and after gelatinization, and cocoa butter droplets can be visualized in the suspension at about room temperature in the range of between 0.5-100 um, or between 0.5-30 um.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition for animal dross and its method of use. More particularly, the present invention relates to a litter that displays colored speckles without being color transferable.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owner had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. House-broken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added absorbent materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The dross-soiled absorbent must be regularly cleaned to maintain a hygienic environment and to thwart the emission of objectionable odors from the presence of the urine and fecal matter in the litter. Removal of fecal matter from any litter is somewhat easy as they are generally solid objects that can be physically removed from the litter. However, physical removal of the feces does not address the issues of removing liquid dross from the litter nor does it help reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Thus it can be said that the removal of the liquid dross from the litter is harder to execute.

Though the absorbent material aids in absorbing liquid dross, removal of the liquid dross and identification of the liquid dross in the litter is still difficult. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, will eventually have to be replaced.

Currently clumping clays and other water absorbent material are used to improve litter compositions. An improved composition for animal litters uses the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral in the montmorillonite clay family. These water absorbent materials not only absorb liquid dross, but they aid in the identification of used litter from unused litter portions. These water absorbent materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine thus facilitating the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter. The wetted clump has the ability to group into a size substantially larger than the individual particles comprising the litter.

Though these improved compositions have eased the owners' task of removing soiled litter portions, they are still short of addressing problems associated with the burial or splitting of the clumped dross. The buried or split clump, if not timely discovered, will emit offensive odors within a relatively short period of time. Thus when the clumped dross is buried or split the homeowner must still either patiently sift through the litter to remove the used portions or simply discard the partially soiled litter. As a result the benefits of having a clumped litter diminishes since the removal of the clumped dross once again becomes a time-consuming as well as costly process.

The following prior art references illustrate aspects of the technology of animal litter preparation, and, in particular, disclose the use of clays in such litters.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,420 issued Aug. 11, 1987 to Stuart, discloses an animal litter composition comprising a water-absorbing polymer such as a polyacrylate combined with a porous inert solid substrate such as clay.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,115 issued Mar. 19, 1991 to Hughes, discloses the use of a water swellable bentonite clay as an absorbent litter material. The clay absorbs the liquids in animal waste which on contacting the clay agglomerates it into a stable mass easily separated from the unwetted and unsoiled portion of the composition.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,532 issued Dec. 7, 1993 to Franklin, et al., discloses a pH-indicating material maintained on an inert carrier that is separate from the cat litter material. The pH-indicating material has dual indicators that provide one color transition at a low pH and a different color transition at a high pH so that acidic or alkaline animal urine problems can be visibly detected upon contact between the animal urine and the pH-indicating material. The pH-indicating material is water and urine soluble and easily transferable.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,054 issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Pluta, et al., discloses an animal litter composition used to diagnose animal health problems. The composition comprises at least one uncalcined clay substrate having a calcium oxide content of less than about 5% by weight and wherein the clay mineral component of said substrate has a attapulgite content of at least about 35% by weight, in combination with at least one chemical pH indicator. All pH indicators are water soluble and easily transferable.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,233 issued Sep. 16, 2003 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,763,783 issued Jul. 20, 2004 both to Mochizuki, disclose a granulated-type, urine-discharge processing material for animals that discriminates between before-use and after-use. The material comprises a water absorbent granular body dyed with water soluble dyes or a water absorbent granular body containing powder of water soluble dyes (which will make it color transferable), and a water absorbent surface layer covering a surface of the water absorbent granular body. The water absorbent surface layer and the water absorbent granular body are bonded to each other through a non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer formed of a plurality of adhesive non-coated parts and a plurality of adhesive coated parts which is coated on the surface of the water absorbent granular body. Discharged animal urine is permeated into the water absorbent granular body through the water absorbent surface layer and the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer, or by dissolving the adhesive coated parts. Thereby, the water soluble dyes are eluted into the discharged urine so that the water absorbent surface layer is dyed through the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer. The water absorbent granular body is chiefly composed of vegetable fiber or vegetable powder and contains inorganic fillers. The water absorbent granular body further contains powder of a water absorbent polymer so that the granular body can have rich water absorbing and retaining properties. No mention is made to clays in the patent.

Color-indicating litters are the most recent advance in litters, however, use of these litters are still problematic. Despite the common problem of tracking the litter in the home, these color-indicating litters may not only be tracked inside the home, but can discolor home furnishings such as carpets, couches and the like, making a small problem even worse. A need exists for a litter that imparts a color but will not bleed into home furnishings even if tracked by the pet through the home.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A non-color transferable animal litter is disclosed that contains painted particulate material and non-painted water absorbent material. The absorbent material may be any clumping or non-clumping material known in the art. Once painted, the particles are colorfast and do not interfere with the function of the non-painted water absorbent materials. The painted particles are colorfast, non-water soluble and impart a speckled appearance to the litter.

"This invention is directed to a dispensing container that has an enhanced appearance. More particularly, this invention is directed to a dispensing container where the dip tube is formed into a decorative shape, which shape optionally coordinates with a design on the front or rear of the bottle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dispensing containers with dip tubes are used to store and dispense a range of personal care products. These include hand soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos and body cleansing gels. There is a constant need to enhance the appearance of these containers. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,937,554, 6,073,373 and 6,233,856 the appearance is enhanced by a decorative film material placed within the container. A design on this decorative film material coordinates with a design on the front and/or rear surface of the container. This gives a 3-D appearance. U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,600 discloses attaching a figurine to the dip tube of a dispensing container. And U.S. Pat. No. 6,276,566 discloses a cylindrical section surrounding the dip tube and depending from the cap area of container, this cylindrical section having a decoration thereon. The objective in each of these patents is to enhance the appearance of the container and the product in the container.

The present invention improves on the techniques of these patents to enhance the appearance of a container and its product. In the present invention, the dip tube is molded to contain a multi-dimensional design. This technique simplifies the manufacture of dip tubes that have an attached identifiable shape since the dip tube and identifiable shape are made in a single operation. This is in distinction to where the dip tube and multi-dimensional shape are separately made and then assembled.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The invention comprises a dispensing container having a body portion and a neck portion. A pump dispenser is supported by the neck portion and comprises a pump mechanism with a dip tube at one end and an exit channel at another end. The dip tube has an identifiable three-dimensional shape as an integral part of the dip tube. A preferred mode of making the three dimensional identifiable shape is by blowmolding. The three-dimensional identifiable shape can be that of a land animal, a sea animal, an air animal or an inanimate object.

The identifiable shape preferably is decorated as to color by a label. This can be by in-mold labeling or by placing a shrink film label over the identifiable shape and heat shrinking the label to the identifiable shape. The colors of the label will be coordinated to the colors needed for the identifiable shape. In the use of in-mold labeling, the dip tube is shaped to have an identifiable shape and colored in a single operation. When a shrink film colored label is used, only two in-line steps are needed.

This identifiable shape on the dip tube will coordinate with a design on front and/or rear label. This coordination yields a three dimensional effect by a label design on the front or rear surface of the container and the identifiable shape.

It also is a preferred embodiment where the refractive index of the liquid in the container and that of the dip tube be within about 0.6 of each other, and preferably about 0.4 In this embodiment the dip tube substantially disappears in the liquid except for the identifiable shape of the dip tube.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Hard surface cleaners are usually mostly water that include cleaning materials, fragrance, and color. Hard Surface cleaners are usually sprayed onto a surface and then wiped to clean the surface. Because hard surface cleaners are mostly water, they will drip when applied to vertical surfaces because of gravity.

This requires a person to quickly wipe the surface before the hard surface cleaner drips down the surface to be cleaned. The dripping of the hard surface cleaner does not allow for a longer residence time of the hard surface cleaner on the surface to effect more cleaning. It would be desirable to have a hard surface cleaner that could remain in place when applied to a surface.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a toothbrush having a mechanical vibratory element and a head having different cleaning/treating elements attached thereon. The present invention also relates to manually held and operated toothbrushes having flexibly mounted bristles. The present invention further relates to a toothbrush, either manual or powered, which includes a handle and a head having elements mounted to the head such as tufts of bristles and/or elastomeric wipers.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A powered toothbrush is designed to assist a user by mechanically moving the head of the toothbrush. One approach is to provide a vibratory element in the body of the toothbrush. U.S. Published Application No. 2002/0124333 relates to a mechanical vibratory device which causes the head part to vibrate. The vibratory device is accommodated in a front head part of the toothbrush, or in a neck-part region adjacent to the head part, said neck part connecting the head part to the handle, and is operatively connected to a power source, accommodated in the handle, via electrical connections running in the neck part, a vibration-dampening element preferably being provided in order to prevent vibration transmission to the handle, this achieves the situation where the vibrations which effect the improved cleaning action are produced predominantly in the head part and can only be felt to a slight extent in the handle, as a result of which comfortable handling of the toothbrush is achieved.

A number of approaches have been taken to provide flexibility to the bristles during use of a toothbrush. U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,564, for example, relates to a toothbrush having an elastomeric ridge wherein there is a center array of bristles and there is a side array of bristles mounted in elastomeric boots. A number of patents relate to a toothbrush head having sets of bristles, each of which is mounted to a non-rigid or elastic support element. Examples of these approaches are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,770,195, 2,244,098, 6,161,245 and 6,311,360 and in French Patent No. 38440.

The head of a conventional toothbrush typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts, bundles or other groupings. A goal of many toothbrushes is to accommodate the cleaning element profile to that of the teeth being cleaned. Achieving that goal is complicated by the difficulty in matching a toothbrush profile to the complex surface of a typical set of human teeth. The latter generally lie in a “C” shaped curve which presents the need for a brush to address a convex outer curve and a concave inner curve. In addition, the toothbrush should be capable of cleaning irregularities on the tooth surface as well as the interproximal area between teeth.

It is well known that the ideal brushing technique from a dental hygiene perspective is an up and down stroke along the vertical surface of teeth which massages the gums while cleaning the teeth. However, due to a number of factors, including ergonomic difficulties, haste, lack of education or the like, few consumers use the recommended brushing technique. Rather, the typical consumer brushes across their teeth in a horizontal motion rather than a vertical movement. Various approaches have been taken by others to translate horizontal brush movement into partial vertical movement of the bristles or cleaning elements.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,783,869 relates to translation of horizontal to vertical movement of cleaning elements through use of a helix groove in a movable shaft within a toothbrush handle. The groove receives a pin which rides in the groove. This mechanism causes the toothbrush head to partially rotate or oscillate as the handle moves left-to-right or vice versa in the user's mouth. That rotation or oscillation causes the cleaning elements to move in a vertical plane perpendicular to movement of the toothbrush handle.

Other mechanisms for movement include an arcuate shaped base for a toothbrush head aligned with the longitudinal axis of the head, wherein a movable arcuate block having cleaning elements is flexibly mounted on the toothbrush head such that the block is free to slide on the head in a manner whereby the cleaning elements may travel in a vertical direction generally transverse to the typical side-to-side motion of the toothbrush; and a pivotal mounting of cleaning elements allowing for the elements to move up and down in concert with a side-to-side stroke along the teeth;

A toothbrush head should provide both proper support for the bristles, and be flexible enough during use to allow the bristles to conform to the shape of a user's mouth or teeth. Additionally, construction techniques should be inexpensive, versatile and consistent.

In an attempt to meet these criteria, a process known as “Anchor Free Tufting” (“AFT”) has been used in the formation of toothbrush heads. In such an AFT process, a head plate for holding toothbrush bristles, and for eventual insertion into a toothbrush body, is typically formed of a rigid plastic that is conducive to sonic welding. The head plate is formed with a solid perimeter and defines a field of variously shaped and sized holes within this perimeter. Fibers that are to form the tufts are then placed in the holes in the field of the head plate, and the backs of the tufts are melted together to fix their position relative to one another.

The tufted head plate is then inserted into a predefined receiving portion of the head portion of a toothbrush handle and is sonically welded into place. The brush is then end-rounded and packaged for sale as a traditional toothbrush.

However, this manufacturing process results in a toothbrush with a very rigid head that does not easily conform to the physical characteristics of a user when brushing. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a toothbrush that can be conveniently manufactured by the above process, but provides the desired flexibility of the head of the toothbrush during use.

It would also be desirable if a toothbrush could be provided having various cleaning/treating elements on a head, such as bristles with different degrees of flexible mounting, to have a enhanced cleaning effect when moved by a mechanical vibratory element.

Further, there is a continuing need in the art for new combinations and arrangements of bristle tufts to provide improved stiffness to enhanced plaque and debris removal, especially within interproximal spaces.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a toothbrush is provided having a handle, a cleaning head attached to said handle, and a mechanical vibratory device which causes the cleaning head to vibrate, said mechanical vibratory device located in the cleaning head or in a region adjacent to the cleaning head and operatively connected to an electric power source, said cleaning head having an outer surface, said cleaning head including a frame, a resilient membrane secured across said frame and movable in a direction toward and away from said outer surface, said resilient membrane defining a cleaning field, a plurality of cleaning/treating elements mounted to said membrane in said cleaning field, at least some of said cleaning/treating elements having physical characteristics which differ from other of said cleaning/treating elements.

The efficacy of an antiperspirant salt can be increased, improved and/or sustained for a longer period of time by enhancing the amount of small molecules of the antiperspirant active salt. Typically, when an aluminum or aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salt is formed, it tends to polymerize into a number of polymeric species. Each polymeric species is correlated with at least one HPLC peak (also referred to as a GPC peak in U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,314). In U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,314, FIGS. 1-6 thereof represent GPC plots of peaks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. Peak 1 corresponds to a zirconium polymeric species with peaks 2-6 corresponding to aluminum polymeric species. The area under the curve (AUC) at the position of each peak is proportional to the amount of the corresponding polymeric species.

Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the size of the polymeric species corresponding to peaks 5 and 6 are smaller than the polymeric species corresponding to the other aluminum peaks (i.e., peaks 2-4). Again without being bound by theory, it is believed that the sequence of the peaks corresponds to the size of the corresponding aluminum polymerics so that peak 2 polymer size>peak 3 polymer size>peak 4 polymer size>peak 5 polymer size>peak 6 polymer size.

It is further believed, without being bound by theory, that the antiperspirant efficacy of a given antiperspirant is inversely proportional to the polymer size of the relevant polymeric species. Also without being bound by theory, this is believed to be true because smaller antiperspirant polymeric species can more readily occlude a pore to a degree sufficient to produce the desired antiperspirant effect. In sum, it is believed that smaller species plug-up the sweat pores more readily and more effectively than do the larger species and, therefore, antiperspirants having a higher proportion of the smaller species will be more effective.

This theory is the basis for the discussion of peak ratios described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,314 (assigned to the Colgate-Palmolive Co.) and U.S. Pat. No. 6,245,325 (assigned to the Gillette Company). In the '325 patent, there is a discussion of the ratio of the peak 4 AUC/peak 3 AUC. This ratio can be increased by increasing the portion of the smaller peak 4 species and/or decreasing the relative portion of the larger peak 3 species. Thereby, the efficacy of the antiperspirant can be enhanced, increased and/or maintained for a longer period of time. In effect, the effort is to improve the stability of the smaller peak 4 species over that of the larger peak 1, 2, and/or 3 species.

To ascertain whether a particular antiperspirant's efficacy has been improved, a number of ingredients may be added to the antiperspirant and then the peak 4 AUC/peak 3 AUC ratio measured by HPLC or GPC as described in the '314 patent. So, as the peak 4 AUC/peak 3 AUC ratio is increased, the proportion of the desirable smaller peak 4 species is increased relative to the less desirable larger peak 3 species.

This peak 4 AUC/peak 3 AUC ratio is also referred to herein as the peak 4/peak 3 ratio or a “first ratio.” Another peak ratio, i.e., the peak 1 AUC/(peak 2 AUC+peak 3 AUC+peak 4 AUC+peak 5 AUC+peak 6 AUC) ratio is referred to herein as the “second ratio.” Also, because peaks 5 and 6 often appear as a single merged peak at peak 5, this “second ratio” is also sometimes referred to as the peak 1 AUC/(peak 2 AUC+peak 3 AUC+peak 4 AUC+peak 5 AUC) ratio with the understanding that the peak 6 AUC is part of the peak 5 AUC.

Additionally, the “first ratio” is proportional to an 27al NMR peak appearing at 63.5 ppm. Thus, an increase in the “first ratio” and an increase in the intensity of the “27al NMR peak appearing at 63.5 ppm”, each represent what is believed to be an increase in the amount of the peak 4 species relative to the amounts of the other polymeric species of the other 2, 3, 5 and 6 peaks. It should be born in mind that peak 1 corresponds to zirconium species and peaks 2-6 correspond to aluminum species.

While the above-noted theory is believed to be sound, such understanding is made without being bound by theory in the event that the changes measured in the “first ratio”, “second ratio” and the “27al NMR peak appearing at 63.5 ppm” yield a more efficacious antiperspirant product due to some, as yet, unrecognized mechanism.

With the foregoing background being provided, there is a need to provide a more effective antiperspirant product. It is believed that a more effective antiperspirant product can be provided by increasing its “first ratio,” decreasing its “second ratio,” and/or increasing the intensity of the “27al NMR peak appearing at 63.5 ppm.”

It is desirable to provide a more effective antiperspirant. It is also desirable to provide an antiperspirant with an increased “first ratio” and/or a decreased “second ratio.” It is also desirable to provide an antiperspirant having an increased intensity of the “27al NMR peak appearing at 63.5 ppm.”

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An improved or more effective antiperspirant composition is provided in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. According to one embodiment, the more effective antiperspirant composition comprises:(a) an antiperspirant salt selected from the group consisting of an aluminum antiperspirant salt, an aluminum-zirconium antiperspirant salt, and a mixture thereof;(b) a betaine component selected from the group consisting of betaine, betaine hydrochloride, and a mixture thereof;(c) a calcium salt; and(d) water.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a manually held and operated toothbrush or to a powered toothbrush which includes a handle and a head. Cleaning elements are mounted to the head such as tufts of bristles. When toothpaste is applied to the cleaning elements the user inserts the head into the mouth and brushes the teeth in a known manner.

The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts or other groupings. The strand groupings are attached to the head either before or after forming the toothbrush handle.

Various attempts have been made for providing flexibility to the manner in which the bristles are attached. Various approaches have also been taken wherein the bristle carrying surface of the head is not flat. U.S. Pat. No. 1,688,581, for example, discloses a toothbrush having a bristle carrying member which is ordinarily bowed inwardly into the hollow head. The bristle carrying member can be bowed outwardly by manipulating a wire mounted in the toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,483,722 discloses a toothbrush with a resilient flexible bristle support which spans spaced parallel handle extensions. Different embodiments of the toothbrush include having the support bowed inwardly or bowed outwardly.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,325,560 relates to an orthodontic toothbrush which includes various rows of bristles including centrally located longitudinally arranged sets of bristles mounted on a flexible member over an air pocket.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,354 discloses a toothbrush of rocker formation wherein base sections are joined together by hinges. The toothbrush also includes a hollow space below the base sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,454,133 discloses a toothbrush having a closed system of passageways for a non-compressible medium such as a compressed gas which flows below the bristle carrying base members.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,870 discloses a toothbrush head with flexibly mounted bristles by utilizing a flexibly resilient lattice network so that the bristles deflect during brushing to conform to various arcuate surfaces of the teeth.

U.S. Pat. No. 2,003,243 issued May 28, 1935 to Campbell et al. discloses blocks containing groups of bristles that are mounted on a flexible wire attached to a rigid toothbrush head (page 1, column 2, lines 45-55). The flexibility of this mounting wire helps the bristles to conform to the shape of teeth being cleaned.

Blakeman U.S. Pat. No. 2,706,825 issued Apr. 26, 1955 discloses a demountable bristle holder for a toothbrush which flexes up and down relative to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush body. This flexible member changes position. This plus the pressure of the brush against teeth and movement of the brush permits the brush to contact the teeth at various degrees of conformation (column 2, lines 15-18).

Peters U.S. Pat. No. 4,520,526 issued Jun. 4, 1985 has a flexible section in the handle which permits the head portion to move relative to the handle portion of the toothbrush in one plane. This patent suggests that the flexibility avoids damaging delicate tooth material and gum tissue (column 1, line 42-44). Similar structures for imparting flexibility to the head of a toothbrush and thereby reduce wear on tooth and gum are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,146,645.

Other approaches to flexible mounting of toothbrush cleaning elements are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,355,546 and 5,839,149. In these patents, the head of the toothbrush is placed under the biting surface of the tooth in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the tooth. The head of the brush when so oriented has short bristles in the middle of the head which are pushed against the biting surface which causes longer outer bristles to rotate into engagement with the side of the teeth and the gum line.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,987,690 issued Nov. 23, 1999 to Heuler discloses a toothbrush with linkages between handle and head that facilitate deflection of the head so that the free bristle ends retain parallel alignment with respect to the handle during use.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,003,189 issued Dec. 21, 1999 discloses a flexible section of a toothbrush between handle and head to absorb part of the force applied by the user of a toothbrush. An elastic shock absorbing means is inserted in this section to bias the head into its inoperative position.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,141,817 discloses a toothbrush head with a central longitudinal axis that underlies the middle of a resilient member containing bristles. The central axis limits deformation of the middle of the resilient member. The balance of the head on either side of the central axis is sloped to allow greater movement of the flexible member, thereby causing outer bristles to splay outward. The outward spraying is believed to improve crevice intrusion of the bristles (column 2, lines 40-46).

European Patent Publication 0 454 625 A1 dated Oct. 30, 1991 discloses a cam in the handle of a tooth-brush that can be used to change the angular orientation of the head relative to the handle.

Other attempts made in the prior art to provide some form of movability of cleaning elements are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,228,466 and WO 90/01281 which disclose a toothbrush wherein both the handle and head are longitudinally hinged so as to provide displaceable bristles which are straddled about a row of teeth.

U.S. Pat. No. 1,616,484 discloses a toothbrush which is hinged along the length of the handle so that two spaced head sections can be disposed back to back with respect to each other. U.S. Pat. No. 1,616,484 discloses a hinged toothbrush that would provide for brushing a tooth from three different directions. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,528,782 and 5,269,083 disclose the bristles as being mounted in a rocking manner. U.S. Pat. No. 5,799,354 discloses the utilization of a hollow space to provide for a hinging action. U.S. Pat. No. 1,924,152 discloses a toothbrush having rows of rubber bristles. U.S. Pat. No. 301,644 discloses a toothbrush having rows of bristles mounted in rubber tongues.

U.S. Pat. No. Des. 421,843 illustrates a toothbrush wherein the bristle carrying surfaces appears to be non-planar.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,240,452 discloses an elastic base toothbrush wherein a bristle carrying plate is mounted over rubber tubes.

A number of patents disclose some tooth and/or gum massage devices having non-planar surfaces. For example, British Patent No. 524135 relates to a gum massaging device having an air filled hollow rubber head to provide an air cushion for the gum massaging members. U.S. Pat. No. 1,058,273 discloses a massaging device having an interior air space. U.S. Pat. No. 2,148,483 discloses a tooth and gum massager and exerciser which includes a void filled with air. U.S. Pat. No. 2,176,309 also discloses a gum massager having air pockets.

Hairbrushes are also disclosed in various patents having dome shaped outer surfaces. Examples of these patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,739,419, 4,500,939 and 5,581,840. Similarly U.S. Pat. No. Des. 892,299 shows a toilet brush with a convex shaped bristle carrying surface.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a toothbrush head having a dome shaped or a trampoline type cleaning element carrying surface to provide increased flexibility of the cleaning elements.

A further object of this invention is to provide a toothbrush wherein the head is hinged along a hinge axis collinear with the longitudinal axis of the head.

A still further object of this invention is to provide such a toothbrush which utilizes cleaning elements that can wrap around the edge of the teeth for simultaneous contact with both the front and top of the teeth.

A yet further object of this invention is to provide manufacturing techniques for making such a toothbrush.

In accordance with one aspect of this invention a toothbrush includes a head in the form of a base having an upstanding wall to create a peripheral frame. A thin resilient membrane is mounted to the frame with an open space between the membrane and the frame. In its initial condition, when the toothbrush is not being used the membrane is convex so that its original shape is dome-like. The membrane is capable of flexing to alter the original shape during use when the cleaning elements carried by the membrane are brushed against the teeth to recover to the original shape randomly during such use.

Preferably, the cleaning elements are bristles secured to the membrane by in-molded technology.

In a preferred practice of the invention the toothbrush head is oval shaped and the membrane is also oval shaped. The membrane is convex in both its longitudinal and transverse directions.

In accordance with another aspect, this invention provides a simplified and effective way to obtain desired flexibility in head and handle. Like a trampoline, at least the portion of the head carrying bristles is constructed to allow easy deformation of the bristles when in use, which improves contact with, and cleaning of, teeth. Pressure on the bristles against the teeth causes the head to deflect along with the bristles but the flexible head is designed to return to its original position once the pressure on the bristle is relieved. During the transition from heavy pressure to no pressure on the handle, the bristle stays in constant contact with the tooth because of the flexibility built into the toothbrush head.

In accordance with still another aspect of this invention the head of the toothbrush has a spine which extends collinear with the longitudinal axis of the head thereby dividing the head into a pair of side by side longitudinal sections connected to the spine. The spine forms a hinge axis made of resilient material which serves as a spring so as to permit the sections to move from and to an original position in response to contacting the teeth.

In a preferred practice of this aspect of the invention the side by side sections may also include soft flexible material. Preferably, the cleaning elements on each section include an outer set of cleaning elements of longer length than an inner set. The outer cleaning elements could function as plaque removal bristles which are of sufficient length to extend partially along the tooth while the inner cleaning elements brush against the tooth. The terminal surfaces of the inner sets of cleaning elements preferably form an obtuse angle from the two sets of inner cleaning elements of the side by side sections to maximize contact with the teeth when the sections are in their original position. During use the brush head is pressed against the edge of the teeth thus causing the flexible hinge to open and close during cleaning.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to wrappers for shaped soap bars. More particularly, this invention relates to a single plastic wrapper for a shaped generally rectangular soap bar.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Soap bars are produced in various shapes. These range from round, to square, to rectangular to elliptical and variations on these shapes. Some soap bar shapes are easy to wrap while others present a measure of difficulty. Square, rectangular and circular shaped bars are relatively easy to package. They can be wrapped in a single relatively thin plastic film folded at the ends and heat sealed. These also can be packaged in a flow wrap. In this type of wrapper, the ends are fin sealed rather than being folded and sealed. However, elliptical shaped bars and generally rectangular shapes having curved edges and curved primary surfaces present packaging difficulties in other than flow wrap packaging. Examples of generally rectangular soap bars are shown in U.S. Des. 345,817; U.S. Des. 346,241; U.S. Des. 348,539 and U.S. Des. 348,541. These design patents are incorporated herein by reference. These have a rectangular-like shape having main top, bottom, side and end surfaces that are curved. Further, the transition of one surface to another surface is curved. The soap bars are rectangular-like but with non-planar top, bottom and front and rear connecting surfaces. The end surfaces may have a flat area for sealing but otherwise usually are curved. This includes ovoid shaped soap bars since they also have an elongated type of structure. The transition from one surface to another surface preferably also is curved. This curving gives the soap bar a pleasing, aesthetic shape. Such soap bars are described herein as generally rectangular shaped soap bars.

In order to wrap such bars so that they have a substantially rectangular shape, a stiffener reinforcing element is conventionally used to shape the package. The stiffener reinforcing element is a piece of relatively stiff material such as paperboard, paperboard coated with plastic or plastic that is wrapped laterally around the soap bar with the ends of the soap bar being open. Then, the soap bar and the stiffener reinforcing element are surrounded by a wrapper which is folded at its ends and the flaps of the folds heat sealed, one to the other. There also is a longitudinal seal of the film on the bottom surface of the package. A problem in the use of a stiffener reinforcing element is that it requires the handling and use of two films. The stiffener reinforcing element film and the wrapper film. The packaging process and cost can be reduced with the use of only one film, the wrapper film. That is, the stiffener reinforcing element films is deleted. It has been found that this can be done if a particular wrapper film is used. This film will be sufficiently stiff to provide a rectangular shape to the packaged soap bar, but yet be able to be readily folded and sealed to produce the package.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

It has been found that a reinforcing element stiffener is not required if a plastic wrapper of about 60 micron to about 180 micron is used, and preferably about 90 micron to about 150 micron. This plastic can be of a monolayer or laminate multilayer construction. Such a plastic has a sufficient thickness to form and maintain a generally rectangular shape, but yet a thickness where the film can be folded to form the end side panels without the need for optional fold enhancement techniques. Preferably, it will be a thermoplastic film or thermoplastic coated paper or paperboard to aid in the sealing of the film. In such a wrapping of soap bars, there also is a longitudinal lap seal on the lower surface of the package with the end seals having folds and the folds sealed. These usually are heat seals since thermoplastic films are used. An adhesive can be used to form such heat seals in conjunction with the thermoplastic film.

The films of this invention have a Taber stiffness of more than about 5 to form the package and are sufficiently flexible so that end panels can be formed and sealed. Preferably the Taber stiffness is about 8 to 20. A preferred film is biaxially oriented polypropylene. This can be a monolayer or a multi-layer of two or more layers. However, any other sealable plastic surface films having similar Taber stiffness can be used. These usually will have a thickness in the 60 micron to 180 micron range. However, it is the stiffness that primarily will control use. The films should have a Taber stiffness of about 7 to 20 which is equivalent to that of about 60 micron to about 180 micron biaxially oriented polypropylene film.

In order to form a more effective bottom longitudinal overlapping seal on the soap bar package the soap bar should have a planar area on its bottom surface. The bottom surface can have curved surfaces and sections but at least one area should be planar. Further this planar area should be adjacent to the area where the bottom overlapping seal is to be made. That is, the overlapping edges of the film should be adjacent to the planar area of the bottom of the soap bar. The seal plate or band will hold the overlapping film edges against the planar area of the bottom surface of the soap bar to effect the bottom seal of the soap bar package.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of toothbrushes, and more particularly, the invention relates to the field of electrically powered toothbrushes, and actuators and packaging therefor.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Electric toothbrushes typically utilize a switch accessible along the exterior or body of the toothbrush that controls operation of the toothbrush. Generally, such switches have two positions, one position in which the toothbrush is not operating or “off” and another position in which the toothbrush is activated or “on.” Generally, these switches are slidable or otherwise linearly displaceable between these two positions. Such position switches have also been modified to also activate their corresponding circuits or mechanisms upon being pushed or depressed. This pushbutton feature may be provided in combination with the previously noted linear position function in a single switch.

Most consumer goods and particularly those that relate to health and beauty are packaged in retail-friendly display cartons such that the product that is being sold may be readily viewed by a consumer contemplating its purchase. Such packaging is currently used for many different brands and models of commercially available electric toothbrushes.

Multi-motion electric toothbrushes are known which are believed to provide superior cleaning efficacy. These toothbrushes often provide multiple brushing motions by two or more brush heads. In addition to the superior cleaning action, the operation of the brush and complex motion of the brush heads often generates interest in a potential purchaser of the toothbrush. That is, many consumers find the operation of the brush to be interesting to watch.

As a result of this phenomenon, the assignee of the present invention previously developed a package for an electric toothbrush that was adapted for retail display and enabled a consumer to activate the toothbrush while sealed within the package. Accordingly, an interested consumer could simply activate a packaged toothbrush by pushing the switch of the toothbrush through its packaging. Some such arrangements are shown in commonly assigned U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,311,837; 6,189,693; and 6,178,579, the substances of which are incorporated herein by reference.

A significant problem with such consumer friendly packaging is that the toothbrush may accidentally be activated during shipment or storage. Furthermore, it is neither practical nor economical to include actuation interlocks in the packaging or to somehow “arm” or selectively enable actuation of the toothbrush prior to retail display.

Accordingly, there is a significant need for an electric toothbrush that may utilize current retail packaging approaches and may be activated after packaging, yet which would not be prone to accidental or unintended activation particularly while in its package.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention achieves all of the foregoing objectives and provides, in a first aspect, a packaged electric toothbrush comprising a package having a cover, a back, and a cavity defined therebetween. The package cover includes a projection that extends from an interior face of the cover. The packaged toothbrush also comprises an electric toothbrush disposed within the cavity of the package.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending beads or particles in cleaning liquid compositions. The means of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants that thicken the liquid, or by the addition of thickening agents such as polymers and gums which thicken the liquid so as to be able to suspend particles or beads therein for long periods of time.

However, the suspension of beads in a cleaning liquid composition by the aforementioned use of surfactants, electrolytes, thickening agents, polymers and gums has some characteristics that consumers may consider unacceptable for certain products. Conventional structured liquids are often opaque or turbid thereby obscuring the suspended beads from the consumer, which are shown to best advantage in a transparent or clear liquid.

Further, the by-product of thickening a liquid to provide structure for suspended beads causes a significant increase in liquid viscosity and a corresponding decrease in liquid pourability, a property which consumers generally do not associate with certain products, such as a liquid detergent product.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a liquid detergent composition comprising surfactants, at least one suspending agent, visible beads that are suspended in the composition, and water wherein the surfactants comprise:a) at least one ammonium or metal salt of a C8-C18linear alkyl benzene sulfonate surfactant.b) at least one ammonium or metal salt of an ethoxylated C8-C18alkyl ether sulfate surfactant having 1 to 30 moles of ethylene oxide; andc) at least one amine oxide surfactant,
wherein at least one of:i) the at least one suspending agent comprises a gum,ii) the liquid detergent composition has a viscosity of less than 3.000 mPas at 25° C. and/oriii) the liquid detergent composition does not include an alkyl polysaccharide surfactant.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

Bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, but have generally been inadequate in respect to their effectiveness and/or safety. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of nubs for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth and particularly for cleaning between the papillae of the tongue. In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of conically shaped nubs.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser is constructed from an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleanser is formed as an elastomeric pad mounted on the head of the oral care implement for improved cleaning, ease of manufacture, and user comfort.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes at least one projection that protrudes from a base of material extending along the head of the implement. In one embodiment, a plurality of projections extend along the head in a spaced apart relationship along a pad formed as an elongate strip that is fixed to the head. In one construction, the base overlies a generally rigid head structure. Alternatively, the base is integrally formed as part of the head thereby forming a flexible head.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of at least one elongate ridge and a plurality of nubs or other discrete projections having a non-elongate structure. As a result, the tongue and other soft tissue of the mouth are cleaned with the benefit of both kinds of cleanser projections for an enhanced cleaning effect.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of hard and soft projections to clean the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth. In one construction, the cleanser includes a plurality of soft nubs and at least one elongate ridge of hard material. In this way, the combined benefits of a soft and hard cleanser can be gained in one implement.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes at least one projection with a scraping edge to be moved over the tongue or other tissue. The edge is formed by sloped surfaces having different inclinations. In one construction, a steeper slope faces generally toward the handle to provide a more aggressive scraping action as the head is dragged out of the mouth. The shallower surface makes the projection less prone to pushing tongue biofilm farther back in the throat.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a seat to facilitate and ease molding of the tissue cleanser to the head. In one preferred construction, the head has one or more protuberances for anchoring the head during molding of the tissue cleanser. The head may also include a basin to further define the outline of the molded tissue cleanser.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement includes a tissue cleanser having means for reducing oral volatile sulfur compounds by 35% from a baseline measured two hours after use.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser for a thorough cleaning of the teeth, gums, tongue and oral surfaces of the cheeks and lips. In a preferred construction, the tooth cleaning elements and tissue cleanser are supported on opposite sides of a supporting head.

In one other aspect of the invention, an oral care implement which includes tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser forms at least one of the tooth cleaning elements as a unitary member with the tissue cleanser.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush which may have an oral care dispenser, such as a breath freshening, teeth cleaning gel capsule, and an oral care accessory, such as a toothpick.

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a waterless, toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth or other accessory, and a dispenser containing a dentifrice or other oral care material and being connected in the bristle or cleaning element portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening or other oral care benefits.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves the problems of the related art by providing in one embodiment a waterless toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth, and a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice and being connected in the bristle portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening, all of which deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening, between teeth cleaning, and breath freshening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical disposable or limited use toothbrush. The toothbrush of the present invention in this embodiment combines three benefits into one toothbrush: (1) tooth surface cleaning provided by the toothbrush bristles or other cleaning elements and the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser; (2) between teeth cleaning provided by the toothpick; and (3) breath freshening provided by the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser.

As embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention is broadly drawn to an oral care toothbrush, preferably comprising: a handle having an oral care head mounted to one end of the handle with an oral care accessory mounted to an opposite end of the handle. A plurality of oral care elements such as cleaning/massage elements, which could be bristles, extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head. The head also includes structure for dispensing oral care material in the oral care field of the head.

In a preferred practice of the invention the oral care toothbrush is characterized by its small size and light weight so that it is readily adaptable for travel use. The oral care toothbrush is preferably capable of having multiple functions by including an accessory as part of the toothbrush such as a toothpick, dental floss or tongue cleaner.

In one practice of this invention the oral care toothbrush includes a toothpick formed at one end of the handle; and a head connected at another end of said handle, said head having a bristle block that includes a plurality of bristles and retains a gel capsule therein, the gel capsule containing a mouth care solution. In further embodiments, the gel capsule can be replaced by a quantity of toothpowder, toothpaste or a tooth cleaning gel dentifrice, to provide the cleaning benefits of the dentifrice within the rupturable dispenser.

Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

Among the advantages of various practices of the invention are that the size and configuration of the toothbrush allows discreet hygienic use, such as no fingers in the mouth, adapting it to be readily used in public areas. Such uses could be done without the need for a sink or fountain or other source of water.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser for cleansing the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, bad breath in healthy people is often attributable to microbial deposits on the tongue. Due to its papillary nature, the tongue creates a unique ecological site that provides a large surface area, which favors the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue can lead to the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers have not adequately met the need. Past scrapers have typically been uncomfortable, risked injury to the user, and/or lacked effectiveness. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of bacteria and other debris with comfort and safety.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser provided with a unique combination of hard and soft materials to effectively cleanse the tongue and other soft tissue within the mouth with comfort and a reduced risk of injury to the user.

In one aspect of the invention, a tongue cleanser is formed of two components that combine to define at least one cleaning projection that extends from a head of an implement. One component of the tongue cleanser is composed of a relatively hard material to provide stability and effective cleaning of the soft tissue. The other component is composed of a relatively soft material to provide comfort and safety to the user during use of the implement.

In one exemplary construction of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes a base composed of a relatively hard material that protrudes from a surface of the head, and a soft material that at least partially overlies the base. The hard base provides good stability for cleaning bacteria and debris from the tongue or other tissue, while the soft layer provides comfort and a reduced risk of injury. In one embodiment, the tip of the base is covered with the soft material. In another embodiment, a small extension of the base tip is exposed through the soft material.

In another exemplary construction, the tongue cleanser includes a projection formed of a soft material, which is embedded in a hard base for enhanced rigidity. In one embodiment, the projection is a tapering member with a narrow tip to engage and clean soft tissue in the mouth and a wide base portion anchored in a hard material portion of the head. The soft material engages the tongue for comfort and safety. The hard material provides enhanced stiffness and stability to the cleanser.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to manually held and operated toothbrushes having flexibly mounted bristles. A number of approaches have been taken in the prior art to provide flexibility to the bristles during use of a toothbrush. U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,564, for example, discloses a toothbrush having an elastomeric ridge wherein there is a center array of bristles and there is a side array of bristles mounted in elastomeric boots. A number of patents disclose a toothbrush head having sets of bristles, each of which is mounted to a non-rigid or elastic support element. Examples of these approaches are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,770,195, 2,244,098, 6,161,245 and 6,311,360 and in French Patent No. 38440.

It would be desirable if a toothbrush could be provided having various cleaning elements such as bristles with different degrees of flexible mounting.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a toothbrush having the head separated into different cleaning areas which differ from each other in the flexible mounting of the cleaning elements.

A further object of this invention is to provide such a toothbrush wherein some of the cleaning areas have the cleaning elements mounted on a relatively fixed or non-movable base while other cleaning areas are mounted on a flexible or elastic pod.

A still further object of this invention is to provide techniques for improving the manufacturability of toothbrushes such as indicated above or toothbrushes having only flexibly mounted cleaning elements.

In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head is divided into a plurality of separate cleaning areas. These areas include at least one and preferably two areas wherein the cleaning elements are mounted to a base with other areas having the cleaning elements mounted to pods wherein the pods have a greater degree of movability than do the bases. The pods are resilient so that during use the cleaning elements could be moved from their initial position and then returned to the initial position.

The pods may be formed from a narrow or small diameter beam extending from the body of the toothbrush head to a cleaning element support pad. Preferably the small diameter beam is enclosed in elastic material.

In a preferred practice of the invention a relatively non-movable base is located at each of the distal and proximal ends of the toothbrush head with at least two elastic pods mounted between the two bases. These various cleaning areas are separated from each other by channels extending completely across the head in a transverse direction.

In accordance with a further aspect of this invention the pods are formed utilizing an IMT process where the bristles are introduced into the mold cavity into which a plastic material is injected. As the injected material cools off, it permanently traps the bristles to form a brush. In order to achieve functional flexibility and proper tuft retention, materials are used to create a pod of mushroom shape by forming a stem and a plate to which the bristles would be secured. The pods are interconnected at the stems to form a first subassembly for making the toothbrush. This subassembly may then be attached to the bulk of the toothbrush, which includes the remainder of the head and the handle, by being overmolded with an entire toothbrush handle during a second injection cycle. As a result, the entire handle could be formed at normal speeds because the IMT process is initially isolated to a smaller material shot size.

"This invention relates to a closure for a container, the closure being comprised of two units. More particularly this invention relates to a closure for containers which closure contains a valve located between a base unit and an upper unit and wherein the closure provides for a positive seal for the container contents using such a valve.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Essentially all containers will have a closure of some type. This can be a cap, a dispensing pump, a dispensing cap, or a cap with an integral valve. This is the case whether the container is a bottle or a tube. The closure can be permanently or removably attached to the container. Some will merely flow the product from a container and others will control the flow from a container. The closures, and the container to be used with a closure, will depend to a large extent on the product that is in the container.

The closure must protect the product prior to and during use. It must prevent components of the product from escaping from the container and prevent external substances from entering the container, prior, during and after use. It also must be easy to use, and if a dispensing closure, must dispense accurate amounts of product and be neat during extended use. There must not be an accumulation of product at the closure exit. Further the closure must be decorative and should be useful with liquid and viscous products. In addition it should provide the option of storing the container during use in various orientations, such as on the closure.

Some of these problems have been addressed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,033 which includes a valve to control the flow from a container. The closure is of a single unit structure with the valve being maintained in place using a retaining ring structure. This decreases the decorative options that can be accomplished with at least two units. In addition, the valve structure would need to be modified to a different shape to be effective for dispensing more viscous products. This valve structure is suited for dispensing liquids such as liquid soaps, shampoos and lotions but not for dispensing more viscous products. U.S. Pat. No. 6,672,487 discloses a related closure with a valve structure similar to that of U.S. Pat. No. 5,897,033. The valve in this patent is captured and locked into place by a bead structure in the closure base and the closure collar. Although there is disclosed a two unit structure the closure collar is a relatively small unit and would not provide a sufficient opportunity to further decorate the product package. Further the structure of this valve would have to be modified for dispensing viscous products. It is designed to dispense less viscous products such as beverages, food condiments and body lotions.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,033,655 discloses valves that are useful for dispensing various products. The disclosures are directed primarily to valve structures and not to any specific container or closure structure. The products that can be dispensed using the disclosed valves range from liquid products to viscous products such as toothpastes. U.S. Pat. No. 6,726,063 also discloses a variety of valves that could be engineered to be useful in dispensing various products. However these patents do not disclose a closure structure that can have enhanced decorative features nor any solutions with regard to protecting the contents of the container from a loss of components or contamination from an exterior source during storage

The present closures solve these problems and can be used on a range of containers, including tube containers. These closures provide for an ease of use and in a preferred embodiment include a valve designed for better control of the product being dispensed and a valve seal design for enhanced protection of the product prior to and during use. It further minimizes any build-up of product at the closure exit when used with viscous products. Additionally the closure structure is susceptible to enhanced decoration and the outer top surface of the closure can be planar so that the container can be stored inverted and in a ready mode for the next use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present closure is comprised of a valve, a base unit and an upper unit. The base unit has a base unit surface with an aperture therein. Within the base unit there is a structure to attach the base unit to a container. The upper unit has an upper unit surface with an aperture in general alignment with the aperture in the base unit when the upper unit overlays and is secured to the base unit. Attached by a hinge to the upper unit is a lid for closing the aperture in the upper unit and consequently also that of the base unit. The lid preferably has a substantially horizontal top surface so that the closure and an attached tube or other container can be stored inverted. A valve is located between the base unit and the upper unit. The lid on an inner surface has a structure to seal the valve when the lid is in the closed position.

In one embodiment of the closure the valve which controls the flow of product from the container is located on the base unit and is maintained in place by a contact fit between the base unit and the upper unit. A lower surface of the upper unit and an upper surface of base unit contact the valve. In a further embodiment the valve comprises a polymer membrane with one or more slit openings. The material of the valve has a stiffness correlated to the rheology of the product being dispensed. The valve must have properties to maintain a product of a given rheology in the container with the container in any orientation, including being inverted. Further the valve must open upon a pressure being exerted on the container and when the pressure is released close and return to its original closed position, thereby cutting off the flow of the product from the container. This results in neat dispensing during use with little or no product build-up at the valve exit.

Additionally, the closure will provide a positive seal to the valve during periods of storage, whether prior to or during use. The closure/valve structure prevents components of the product in the container from escaping from the container and contaminants from the exterior from entering into the container.

The products will have a viscosity of about 15,000 centipoise to about 90,000 centipoise and preferably about 25,000 centipoise to about 60,000 centipoise. These products include toothpastes. The valve will have a specific gravity of about 1 to 1.2, an elongation of about 400% to about 700% and a tensile strength of about 1200 psi to about 1600 psi.

In a further embodiment the base unit and the upper unit can be of different materials and/or of different colors to enhance the decorative appearance of the container and closure.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dentifrices such as tooth powders and toothpastes containing herbal ingredients are known. An example of such a dentifrice is Red Tooth Powder, manufactured by Dabur India Ltd, and is reported to contain, inter alia, clove oil, black pepper, blend of mint oils, long pepper, ginger, camphor, tomar seed andterminalia chebula.

Other oral care compositions that contain antibacterial seed or pulp extract from the citrus or grape families are known. These compositions may contain additional components such as red iron oxide as a tooth cleaning cum color modifying substances, and calcium carbonate as an abrasive polishing agents.

Red color can be imparted to dentifrices by red ocher, a mineral rich in red iron oxide (anhydrous iron (III) oxide or hematite). However, red ocher is harshly abrasive to tooth enamel.

There remains a need for herbal dentifrice compositions having a pronounced red color, which can be associated in the minds of consumers with certain oral health benefits, but which exhibits a mild abrasivity to teeth and gums.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

There is now provided a dentifrice composition comprising (a) calcium carbonate having properties of particle size and angularity effective to provide mild abrasivity to dental enamel; (b) red iron oxide of low abrasivity. The red iron oxide is present in an amount sufficient to clean and/or polish the teeth and also imparts a red color to the composition. A herbal component comprising at least one botanical agent or extract thereof, is also included.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Body wash products can be very inefficient delivery vehicles for depositing hydrophobic actives and moisturizers on the skin's surface, since most of the hydrophobic actives are rinsed away during the washing process. The majority of body wash products consist of entangled rod-like micelle formulas. Current oil-in-water body wash formulas do not form stable products at high oil concentrations, since the oils and product aqueous base have significantly different densities. Since micellar based body washes can have high viscosities, but not long range structure (substantially larger than the dimensions of the surfactant micelles themselves), products containing high concentrations of oil will be unstable and phase separate with time. One solution to this problem is to use oil-in-water emulsion systems to incorporate oil into surfactant systems. However, these systems can require heat to make, may be unstable at higher oil concentrations, and may result in a significant impairment of cleansing properties at low surfactant concentrations.

Spherulite based formulas with lamellar surfactant phases which form structured systems have been described. Examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,661,189; 5,965,500; and 6,174,846. These spherulite systems are used primarily to enhance the stability of body wash formulas containing significant amounts of emollients and oils through a significant reduction in the rate of diffusion of oil droplets in the surfactant media. Thus, increased concentrations of oils can be incorporated into the products with the potential to delivery higher concentrations to the skin's surface, when compared to rod like micelle formulations.

The rheological behavior of all surfactant solutions, including liquid cleansing solutions, is strongly dependent on the microstructure, i.e., the shape and concentration of micelles or other self-assembled structures in solution. When there is sufficient surfactant to form micelles (concentrations above the critical micelle concentration or CMC), for example, spherical, cylindrical (rod-like) or discoidal micelles may form. As surfactant concentration increases, ordered liquid crystalline phases such as lamellar phase, hexagonal phase or cubic phase may form. The lamellar phase, for example, consists of alternating surfactant bilayers and water layers. These layers are not generally flat but fold to form spherical onion like structures called vesicles or liposomes. The hexagonal phase, on the other hand, consists of long cylindrical micelles arranged in a hexagonal lattice. In general, the microstructure of most personal care products consist of either spherical micelles; rod micelles; or a lamellar dispersion.

As noted above, micelles may be spherical or rod-like. Formulations having spherical micelles tend to have a low viscosity and exhibit newtonian shear behavior (i.e., viscosity stays constant as a function of shear rate; thus, if easy pouring of product is desired, the solution is less viscous and, as a consequence, it doesn't suspend as well). In these systems, the viscosity increases linearly with surfactant concentration.

Rod micellar solutions are more viscous because movement of the longer micelles is restricted. At a critical shear rate, the micelles align and the solution becomes shear thinning. Addition of salts increases the size of the rod micelles thereof increasing zero shear viscosity (i.e., viscosity when sitting in bottle) which helps suspend particles but also increases critical shear rate (point at which product becomes shear thinning; higher critical shear rates means product is more difficult to pour).

Lamellar dispersions differ from both spherical and rod-like micelles because they can have high zero shear viscosity (because of the close packed arrangement of constituent lamellar droplets), yet these solutions are very shear thinning (readily dispense on pouring). That is, the solutions can become thinner than rod micellar solutions at moderate shear rates.

In formulating liquid cleansing compositions, therefore, there is the choice of using rod-micellar solutions (whose zero shear viscosity, e.g., suspending ability, is not very good and/or are not very shear thinning); or lamellar dispersions (with higher zero shear viscosity, e.g. better suspending, and yet are very shear thinning).

To form such lamellar compositions, however, some compromises have to be made. First, generally higher amounts of surfactant are required to form the lamellar phase. Thus, it is often needed to add auxiliary surfactants and/or salts which are neither desirable nor needed. Second, only certain surfactants will form this phase and, therefore, the choice of surfactants is restricted.

In short, lamellar compositions are generally more desirable (especially for suspending emollient and for providing consumer aesthetics), but more expensive in that they generally require more surfactant and are more restricted in the range of surfactants that can be used.

When rod-micellar solutions are used, they also often require the use of external structurants to enhance viscosity and to suspend particles (again, because they have lower zero shear viscosity than lamellar phase solutions). For this, carbomers and clays are often used. At higher shear rates (as in product dispensing, application of product to body, or rubbing with hands), since the rod-micellar solutions are less shear thinning, the viscosity of the solution stays high and the product can be stringy and thick. Lamellar dispersion based products, having higher zero shear viscosity, can more readily suspend emollients and are typically more creamy. Again, however, they are generally more expensive to make (e.g., they are restricted as to which surfactants can be used and often require greater concentration of surfactants).

In general, lamellar phase compositions are easy to identify by their characteristic focal conic shape and oily streak texture while hexagonal phase exhibits angular fan-like texture. In contrast, micellar phases are optically isotropic.

It should be understood that lamellar phases may be formed in a wide variety of surfactant systems using a wide variety of lamellar phase “inducers” as described, for example, in PCT publication, WO 97/05857. Generally, the transition from micelle to lamellar phase is a function of effective average area of headgroup of the surfactant, the length of the extended tail, and the volume of tail. Using branched surfactants or surfactants with smaller headgroups or bulky tails are all effective ways of inducing transitions from rod micellar to lamellar.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,189 directed to a detergent composition, teaches an aqueous liquid cleansing and moisturizing composition comprising a surface active agent selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic and cationic surface active agents and mixtures thereof; an benefit agent having a weight average particle size in the range 50 to 500 microns; and a thickening agent. The thickening agent is added to the benefit agent in amount from 1 to 50% wt, based on the benefit agent.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,500 for a stable liquid composition comprising high levels of emollients, teaches the use of high foaming aqueous liquid compositions with levels of oil/emollient equal to or in excess of level of surfactant. Good levels of foam can be maintained at such high levels of emollient. In addition to surfactant and emollient, compositions also preferably comprise C12-24 fatty acid and/or cationic polymer.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,846 for a liquid composition with enhanced low temperature stability, teaches the use of liquid cleansing compositions in a lamellar phase. Use of minimum amounts of defined polymeric hydrophilic emulsifier in combination with a lamellar phase inducing structurant has been found to enhance both initial viscosity and free thaw (low temperature) viscosity/stability.

United States Patent Application Publication No. 2003/018046 for a stable surfactant composition for suspending components teaches free-flowing surfactant composition comprising at least one anionic surface-active agent, an alkanolamide, an electrolyte, and water is described. In particular, the composition is a surfactant composition that has free-flowing non-Newtonian shear thinning properties and the ability to suspend components and is stable under at least one freeze/thaw cycle.

It is to be noted, however, that current spherulite products require improvement in delivering oil to substrates such as skin, hair or wool. Thus, there remains a need to provide enhanced delivery of an oil phase to a substrate such as skin, hair or wool by incorporating the oil into the spherulite formula at a later stage in the manufacturing process, and protecting the oil from excessive emulsification.

There is also a need to enhance the delivery of the oil phase to the skin by incorporating the oil into the spherulite formula at a later stage in the manufacturing process, in conjunction with increased salt concentrations.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush assembly having an environmentally safe polymer battery.

2. Description of the Related Art

Many conventional toothbrushes use batteries to power movable bristles and/or to illuminate light sources provided in the toothbrush handle. For example, various types of powered toothbrushes are generally known in the art. U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 discloses an electrically driven toothbrush having a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft connects to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 shows a further type of powered toothbrush wherein the head includes a pair of concentrically arranged sections, each of which is driven in a rotationally oscillating manner in opposite directions.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,313 discloses a household appliance such as a toothbrush that may be used for cleaning, polishing, or massaging. The head of the appliance includes a plurality of co-axially rotatable or parallel linearly-movable sections, but fails to provide other bristle-containing sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567 discloses an electrically-driven toothbrush that includes a rotatable brush head having bristles thereon. A further group of bristles, each of which rotates around its own axis, reside adjacent to the brush head.

Known illuminated toothbrush constructions include an enlarged handle housing circuitry connected to a battery for powering small light bulbs mounted in the handle wall to form a plurality of light points on the surface of the toothbrush. This is seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,845,796 and 5,339,479. The purpose of such a construction is, at least partially, to motivate children to brush their teeth, as the pinpoints or discrete areas of light are deemed to add an element of interest and novelty to the brushing process, offering a fun and exciting way for children to brush their teeth. Such excitement motivates children to brush their teeth often, to set in place lifelong habits of good oral hygiene. Standard micro batteries may be used to provide sufficient power to illuminate the toothbrush during brushings for six to twelve months, which is about the normal useful life of a toothbrush. However, replacement batteries may also be used.

All of these toothbrush patents disclose use of conventional batteries. Unfortunately, conventional batteries (e.g., alkaline batteries) have their shortcomings. First, they are not physically or environmentally safe. Potassium hydroxide electrolyte, a strong alkali, is contained within the cells of the batteries. If alkaline batteries are damaged or mishandled, the potassium hydroxide may leak out of the battery cell. Severe chemical burns can result if potassium hydroxide comes into contact either skin or eyes. Conventional batteries account for a significant percentage of heavy metal contaminants in landfills and incinerators. The major concern with consumer batteries in landfills is their corrosiveness and toxic heavy metal content. As the batteries are damaged or corroded, the contents spill into the environment. Second, conventional batteries used for toothbrushes (e.g., AA batteries) are typically not small in size. Finally, conventional toothbrush batteries are not flexible, but rather contain rigid housings (e.g., housings of nine-volt batteries).

A promising application of conducting polymers is in energy storage devices. Battery systems have been extensively studied where a p-dopable conducting polymer is uses as the cathode active material and a metal, often lithium, is used as the anode active material. Various p-dopable materials have been studied: polyacetylene, poly-(p-phenylene), polypyrrole, polyaniline, etc. A battery with n-dopable conducting polymer, polyacetylene, as the anode material and a metal oxide as cathode active material has also been described. Such batteries may be constructed from multiple polymer films, making them lightweight and flexible. Since polymer batteries are moldable into various shapes and flexible, they may be incorporated into compact devices and take up much less space. These polymeric batteries have remarkably high charge capacities, and excellent cycling efficiency. The provision of polymeric materials further permits the polymeric battery to be substantially free of metal components, thereby improving handling of the battery and obviating the safety and environmental concerns associated with conventional batteries. Various types of polymer-based batteries are known in the art, as shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,801,512, 4,804,594, 5,527,640, 5,665,490, 5,733,683, and 5,888,672.

Despite the desirable features of polymer batteries, none of toothbrush art discloses a toothbrush (manual or powered) that uses an environmentally safe polymer battery. Thus, there is a need in the art for a toothbrush that uses such a battery. Such polymer batteries contain no heavy metals making them environmentally safe; are low in cost; are small in size, saving space in the toothbrush housing and enabling the housing to be smaller (saving on materials of construction); can be shaped to fit into the housing design; and exhibit high charging capacities with excellent cycling efficiencies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves the problems of the related art by providing a toothbrush having a polymer battery as a power source. The polymer battery contains no heavy metals, making it environmentally safe, and contains no alkaline, making it physically safe. The polymer battery is inexpensive and, preferably, rechargeable, making it an economical power source for the toothbrush. The small size of the polymer battery saves space in the toothbrush housing, enabling the housing to be smaller and saving on materials of construction. The flexible nature of the polymer battery enables it to be shaped to fit into or around the periphery of the toothbrush housing design.

In a first embodiment of the invention, a manual, light interactive toothbrush is formed of generally conventional form and shape. The toothbrush handle may be provided internally with a small light source, such as a light emitting diode (LED), electrically coupled to a polymer battery. The manual toothbrush handle may be molded with an inner body of transparent or translucent plastic material and an opaque outer layer formed with discrete, spaced-apart openings or windows on its surface. The openings expose the surfaces of the plastic inner body beneath, which may be roughened to emit a softened, diffused light through the windows. Light from the LED travels along the length of the handle and is internally reflected such that reflected light rays striking the roughened windows exposed through the opaque outer layer can emit light at discrete points on the handle and, if desired, also at the head. A highly reflective coating may be applied over the plastic inner body and under the opaque outer coating, except at those areas used for the light points or windows, to ensure that most of the light is reflected down the length of the handle and not substantially absorbed by the opaque outer coating. Reflective patches may be applied over areas of the handle which are positioned to gather and direct light toward the windows in the handle surface.

In a second embodiment of the present invention, a powered toothbrush may be formed of generally conventional form and shape. The powered toothbrush handle may be provided internally with a small light source, such as an LED, electrically coupled to a polymer battery, as well as a drive mechanism, such as a drive shaft rotated by a driving motor, also electrically coupled to the polymer battery. If the powered toothbrush is provided with a light source, then preferably the powered toothbrush handle will have the same configuration as the manual toothbrush handle, as described in the first embodiment of the invention. If the powered toothbrush is not provided with a light source, then the powered toothbrush handle will take on a conventional powered toothbrush configuration, and the polymer battery will be used solely to provide power to the drive mechanism.

Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application claims the benefit of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/207,238, filed Aug. 19, 2005, which in turn claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 60/603,125, filed Aug. 19, 2004, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Body wash products can be very inefficient delivery vehicles for depositing hydrophobic actives and moisturizers on the skin's surface, since most of the hydrophobic actives are rinsed away during the washing process. The majority of body wash products consist of entangled rod-like micelle formulas. Current oil-in-water body wash formulas do not form stable products at high oil concentrations, since the oils and product aqueous base have significantly different densities. Since micellar based body washes can have high viscosities, but not long range structure (substantially larger than the dimensions of the surfactant micelles themselves), products containing high concentrations of oil will be unstable and phase separate with time. One solution to this problem is to use oil-in-water emulsion systems to incorporate oil into surfactant systems. However, these systems can require heat to make, may be unstable at higher oil concentrations, and may result in a significant impairment of cleansing properties at low surfactant concentrations.

Spherulite based formulas with lamellar surfactant phases which form structured systems have been described. Examples include U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,661,189; 5,965,500; and 6,174,846. These spherulite systems are used primarily to enhance the stability of body wash formulas containing significant amounts of emollients and oils through a significant reduction in the rate of diffusion of oil droplets in the surfactant media. Thus, increased concentrations of oils can be incorporated into the products with the potential to delivery higher concentrations to the skin's surface, when compared to rod like micelle formulations.

The rheological behavior of all surfactant solutions, including liquid cleansing solutions, is strongly dependent on the microstructure, i.e., the shape and concentration of micelles or other self-assembled structures in solution. When there is sufficient surfactant to form micelles (concentrations above the critical micelle concentration or CMC), for example, spherical, cylindrical (rod-like) or discoidal micelles may form. As surfactant concentration increases, ordered liquid crystalline phases such as lamellar phase, hexagonal phase or cubic phase may form. The lamellar phase, for example, consists of alternating surfactant bilayers and water layers. These layers are not generally flat but fold to form spherical onion like structures called vesicles or liposomes. The hexagonal phase, on the other hand, consists of long cylindrical micelles arranged in a hexagonal lattice. In general, the microstructure of most personal care products consist of either spherical micelles; rod micelles; or a lamellar dispersion.

As noted above, micelles may be spherical or rod-like. Formulations having spherical micelles tend to have a low viscosity and exhibit newtonian shear behavior (i.e., viscosity stays constant as a function of shear rate; thus, if easy pouring of product is desired, the solution is less viscous and, as a consequence, it doesn't suspend as well). In these systems, the viscosity increases linearly with surfactant concentration.

Rod micellar solutions are more viscous because movement of the longer micelles is restricted. At a critical shear rate, the micelles align and the solution becomes shear thinning. Addition of salts increases the size of the rod micelles thereof increasing zero shear viscosity (i.e., viscosity when sitting in bottle) which helps suspend particles but also increases critical shear rate (point at which product becomes shear thinning; higher critical shear rates means product is more difficult to pour).

Lamellar dispersions differ from both spherical and rod-like micelles because they can have high zero shear viscosity (because of the close packed arrangement of constituent lamellar droplets), yet these solutions are very shear thinning (readily dispense on pouring). That is, the solutions can become thinner than rod micellar solutions at moderate shear rates.

In formulating liquid cleansing compositions, therefore, there is the choice of using rod-micellar solutions (whose zero shear viscosity, e.g., suspending ability, is not very good and/or are not very shear thinning); or lamellar dispersions (with higher zero shear viscosity, e.g. better suspending, and yet are very shear thinning).

To form such lamellar compositions, however, some compromises have to be made. First, generally higher amounts of surfactant are required to form the lamellar phase. Thus, it is often needed to add auxiliary surfactants and/or salts which are neither desirable nor needed. Second, only certain surfactants will form this phase and, therefore, the choice of surfactants is restricted.

In short, lamellar compositions are generally more desirable (especially for suspending emollient and for providing consumer aesthetics), but more expensive in that they generally require more surfactant and are more restricted in the range of surfactants that can be used.

When rod-micellar solutions are used, they also often require the use of external structurants to enhance viscosity and to suspend particles (again, because they have lower zero shear viscosity than lamellar phase solutions). For this, carbomers and clays are often used. At higher shear rates (as in product dispensing, application of product to body, or rubbing with hands), since the rod-micellar solutions are less shear thinning, the viscosity of the solution stays high and the product can be stringy and thick. Lamellar dispersion based products, having higher zero shear viscosity, can more readily suspend emollients and are typically creamier. Again, however, they are generally more expensive to make (e.g., they are restricted as to which surfactants can be used and often require greater concentration of surfactants).

In general, lamellar phase compositions are easy to identify by their characteristic focal conic shape and oily streak texture while hexagonal phase exhibits angular fan-like texture. In contrast, micellar phases are optically isotropic.

It should be understood that lamellar phases may be formed in a wide variety of surfactant systems using a wide variety of lamellar phase “inducers” as described, for example, in PCT publication, WO 97/05857. Generally, the transition from micelle to lamellar phase is a function of effective average area of headgroup of the surfactant, the length of the extended tail, and the volume of tail. Using branched surfactants or surfactants with smaller headgroups or bulky tails are all effective ways of inducing transitions from rod micellar to lamellar.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,661,189 directed to a detergent composition, teaches an aqueous liquid cleansing and moisturizing composition comprising a surface active agent selected from anionic, nonionic, zwitterionic and cationic surface active agents and mixtures thereof; an benefit agent having a weight average particle size in the range 50 to 500 microns; and a thickening agent. The thickening agent is added to the benefit agent in amount from 1 to 50% wt, based on the benefit agent.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,500 for a stable liquid composition comprising high levels of emollients, teaches the use of high foaming aqueous liquid compositions with levels of oil/emollient equal to or in excess of level of surfactant. Good levels of foam can be maintained at such high levels of emollient. In addition to surfactant and emollient, compositions also preferably comprise C12-24 fatty acid and/or cationic polymer.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,174,846 for a liquid composition with enhanced low temperature stability, teaches the use of liquid cleansing compositions in a lamellar phase. Use of minimum amounts of defined polymeric hydrophilic emulsifier in combination with a lamellar phase inducing structurant has been found to enhance both initial viscosity and free thaw (low temperature) viscosity/stability.

U.S. Patent Application Publication Number 2003/018046 for a stable surfactant composition for suspending components teaches free-flowing surfactant composition comprising at least one anionic surface-active agent, an alkanolamide, an electrolyte, and water is described. In particular, the composition is a surfactant composition that has free-flowing non-Newtonian shear thinning properties and the ability to suspend components and is stable under at least one freeze/thaw cycle.

It is to be noted, however, that current spherulite products require improvement in delivering oil to substrates such as skin, hair or wool. Thus, there remains a need to provide enhanced delivery of an oil phase to a substrate such as skin, hair or wool by incorporating the oil into the spherulite formula at a later stage in the manufacturing process, and protecting the oil from excessive emulsification.

There is also a need to enhance the delivery of the oil phase to the skin by incorporating the oil into the spherulite formula at a later stage in the manufacturing process, in conjunction with increased salt concentrations.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending materials such as beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The methods of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants to structure the liquid, or by the addition of structuring agents such as polymers, natural gums and clays which enable the liquid to suspend materials therein for long periods of time. These suspended materials can be functional, aesthetic or both. By aesthetic it is meant that the suspended materials impart a certain visual appearance that is pleasing or eye catching. By functional it is meant that the suspended materials contribute to the action of the composition in cleaning, fragrance release, shine enhancement, or other intended action of the composition.

The suspension of materials, however; in a structured cleaning liquid composition by the aforementioned use of surfactants, polymers, natural gums and clays has characteristics that consumers often do not associate with acceptable liquid dish detergents. Conventional structured liquids are often opaque or turbid thereby obscuring the visual appeal to the consumer of the suspended materials which are shown to best advantage in a nearly transparent or clear liquid.

Further, a side effect of structuring a liquid to suspend materials is that it causes a significant increase in liquid viscosity and a corresponding decrease in liquid pourability and ease of dissolution in water. Both properties are generally not considered consumer acceptable, particularly, in liquid cleaning products like hand dishwashing liquid. Finally, the dissolution rate of the structured liquid in water is desired to be rapid so that foam generation is not delayed. Foam is a signal to consumers that the detergent is high quality. Pourability and dissolution are in part linked to liquid viscosity.

When structuring a liquid detergent with a high surfactant content, the ionic strength of the surfactants can cause a collapse of structuring agents that can be included to provide structure to the liquid. To overcome the collapse of the structuring agents, a higher amount of structuring agents may be required, but this can reduce the water dispersability of the liquid detergent and increase the cost. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a structured liquid that can suspend particles and still have a desired pourability and dissolution rate.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

This invention relates to a dentifrice and more particularly to a dentifrice containing rapidly water hydratable film flakes suspended in the dentifrice composition which impart to the dentifrice decorative, cosmetic and therapeutic benefits.

2. The Prior Art

Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. In many cases ornamental effects have been used to distinguish particular products in the marketplace and identify products having particular distinct properties. In the dentifrice field, substantially clear dentifrice products such as toothpastes and gels which have incorporated therein contrasting colored flakes are known. Such flakes provide an aesthetic effect which the consumer finds pleasing and promotes the use of the dentifrice, particularly by children. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products so as to encourage the use of dentifrices in practicing oral hygiene.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dentifrice having suspended therein flakes of a water hydratable film (hereinafter film flakes) comprised of a homogeneous mixture of a water soluble hydroxyalkyl cellulose polymer and starch, the film matrix having entrained therein an agent selected from therapeutic, cosmetic and decorative agents.

In one embodiment of the invention there is provided an aesthetically decorative dentifrice having distributed throughout film flakes in which a decorative colorant is entrained in the film matrix, the dentifrice vehicle being substantially clear so that the aesthetically decorative effect can be viewed by the user.

In a second embodiment, therapeutic agents such as antibacterial agents and fluoride anticaries salts, are entrained in the film flake matrix.

In a third embodiment cosmetic agents such as sweetening agents, breath freshening agents, are entrained in the film flake matrix which flavorants are rapidly released as the flakes disintegrate during toothbrushing, delivering a pleasing burst of sweetness or breath freshening flavor into the oral cavity.

The entrainment of the therapeutic and cosmetic agents in the film flake matrix suspended in the dentifrice isolates these agents from interaction with reactive ingredients present in the dentifrice so that the agents are maintained substantially separate from the reactive dentifrice ingredients during manufacture and storage while subsequently being released from the film matrix when the dentifrice containing the film flakes is topically applied to the tooth surface as by tooth brushing.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

The term “substantially clear” when used in to describe the present invention shall mean translucent or transparent. The term “dentifrice” shall include toothpastes and gels.

The Film Flakes

The film flakes of the present invention are formed from a matrix comprised of hydroxyalkyl methylcellulose starch and starch film forming agents in which is entrained a colorant such a dye or pigment, a flavorant, sweetener and/or a therapeutic agent such as an antibacterial agent or a breath freshening agent. The film matrix can further comprise water, additional film forming agents, plasticizing agents, surfactants and emulsifying agents.

Preparation of Film Matrix

In preparing the film matrix according to the present invention the hydroxyalkylmethyl cellulose, a starch ingredient, a colorant, flavor, sweetener and/or therapeutic agents and other film forming ingredients are dissolved in a compatible solvent to form a film forming composition. The film forming composition is cast on a releasable carrier and dried to form a sheet of film matrix material. The carrier material must have a surface tension which allows the film solution to spread evenly across the intended carrier width without soaking to form a destructive bond between the film carrier substrates. Examples of suitable carrier materials include glass, stainless steel, Teflon and polyethylene-impregnated paper. Drying of the film may be carried out at high temperature using a drying oven, drying terminal, vacuum drier, or any other suitable drying equipment which does not adversely effect the ingredients of which the film is composed.

The film thickness ranges in size from 0.5 to 10 microns and preferably 2 to 3 microns. The dried film of the present invention is then cut or punched into shaped flakes having a particle size of 0.01 to 0.50 inches preferably 0.08 to 0.25 inches.

Additional stability can be provided to the shapes formed from the dried film, by applying to the film, before shaping into flakes, a protective barrier overcoat such as a food grade shellac or ethyl cellulose.

When the film is to be used for decorative effect, the film once formed is punched into various attractive shaped flakes such as hearts, stars, diamonds and circles. The film flakes are incorporated in the base dentifrice of the present invention at a concentration of about 0.05 to 1.0% by weight and preferably 0.1 to about 0.5% by weight.

Film Forming Agents

The major film forming agent used to prepare the film matrix of the present invention is an hydroxyalkyl cellulose such as hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethylpropyl cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose. Preferably the cellulose polymer is a low viscosity hydropropylmethyl cellulose polymer (HPMC). When HPMC is used as the film forming agent it is preferred that the HPMC have a viscosity in the range of about 1 to about 40 millipascal seconds (mPa·s) as determined as a 2% by weight aqueous solution of the HPMC at 20° C. using a Ubbelohde tube viscometer. Preferably the HPMC has a viscosity of about 3 to about 20 mPa·s at 20° C.

HPMC is available commercially from the Dow Chemical Company under the trade designation Methocel E5 LV. Methocel E5 LV is a USP grade, low viscosity HPMC having 29.1% methoxyl groups and 9% hydroxyproxyl group substitution. It is a white or off-white free-flowing dry powder. As a 2 wt. % solution in water as measured with a Ubbelohde tube viscometer it has a viscosity of 5.1 mPa·s at 20° C.

The hydroxyalkyl methyl cellulose is incorporated in the film matrix in amounts ranging from about 10 to about 60% by weight and preferably about 15 to about 40% by weight.

Cold water swellable, physically modified and pregelatenized starches are particularly useful as texture modifier to increase the stiffness of the hydroxyalkyl methyl cellulose film matrix of the present invention. In the preparation of such starch products, the granular starch is cooked in the presence of water and possibly an organic solvent at a temperature not higher than 10° C. higher than the gelatinization temperature. The obtained starch is then dried.

Pregelatinized corn starch is available commercially. A preferred starch is available under the trade designation Cerestar Polar Tex-Instant 12640 from the Cerestar Company. This Cerestar starch is a pregelaterized, stabilized and crosslinked waxy maize starch. It is readily dispersible and swellable in cold water. In its dry form, it is a white free flowing powder with an average flake size no greater than 180 micrometers and 85% of the flakes are smaller than 75 micrometers. It has a bulk density of 44 lbs/ft3.

The Cerestar starch has excellent cold storage and freeze-thaw stability. It has a rapid hydration rate and can reach extremely high viscosity without cooking. It has a smooth and creamy texture similar to cook-up starches. It also has excellent paste clarity and a bland flavor.

The pregelatinized starch is present in the film matrix of the present invention in an amount ranging from about 5 to about 50% by weight and preferably about 10 to about 35% by weight.

The hydroxyalkyl cellulose to starch ratio (by weight) may vary from about 1:3 to about 4:1 and preferably about 1:1.5 to about 2.5:1.

Decorative Film Flake Ingredients

Colorants used to prepare the film flakes as well as the dentifrice into which the film flakes may be suspended, are pharmacologically and physiologically non-toxic when used in the suggested amounts. The colorants include both pigments and dyes. Pigments useful in the practice of the present invention include non-toxic, water insoluble inorganic pigments such as titanium dioxide, titanium dioxide coated mica (Timiron), chromium oxide greens, ultramarine blues and pinks and ferric oxides as well as water insoluble dye lakes prepared by extending calcium or aluminum salts of FD&C dyes on alumina such as FD&C Green #1 lake, FD&C Blue #2 lake, FD&C R&D #30 lake and FD&C # Yellow 15 lake. The pigments have a flake size in the range of 5 to 1000 microns, preferably 250 to 500 microns. Pigments are incorporated in the decorative film matrix of the present invention in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 10% by weight and preferably about 2 to about 5% by weight.

A particularly preferred class of dyes are those available from Micropowders, Inc. under the trade designation Spectra bead which are high molecular weight polyethylene powders permanently colored with dyes such as FD&C Blue #1 aluminum lake.

Dyes used in the practice of the present invention are distributed uniformly throughout the film flake matrix or the dentifrice and are desirably food color additives presently certified under the Food Drug & Cosmetic Act for use in food and ingested drugs, including dyes such as FD&C Red No. 3 (sodium salt of tetraiodofluorescein), Food Red 17, disodium salt of 6-hydroxy-5-{(2-methoxy-5-methyl-4-sulphophenyl)azo}-2-naphthalenesulfonic acid, Food Yellow 13, sodium salt of a mixture of the mono and disulphonic acids of quinophtalone or 2-(2-quinolyl) indanedione, FD&C Yellow No. 5 (sodium salt of 4-p-sulfophenylazo-1-p-sulfophenyl-5-hydroxypyrazole-3 carboxylic acid), FD&C Yellow No. 6 (sodium salt of p-sulfophenylazo-B-naphtol-6-monosulfonate), FD&C Green No. 3 (disodium salt of 4-{[4-(N-ethyl-p-sulfobenzylamino)-phenyl]-(4-hydroxy-2-sulfoniumphenyl)-methylene}-[1-(N-ethyl-N-p-sulfobenzyl)-Δ-3,5-cyclohexadienimine], FD&C Blue No. 1 (disodium salt of dibenzyldiethyl-diaminotriphenylcarbinol trisulfonic acid anhydrite), FD&C Blue No. 2(sodium salt of disulfonic acid of indigotin) and mixtures thereof in various proportions.

The concentration of the dye is present in the film matrix in an amount ranging from about 0.5 to about 5 and preferably about 1 to about 4% by weight.

The dentifrice base in which the film flakes are suspended is preferably substantially clear and contains a dye or pigment contrasting to that incorporated in the film flakes. Concentration of a contrasting dye or pigment in the dentifrice can range in an amount from about 0.05 percent to about 10 percent by weight with respect to the weight of the base dentifrice and preferably present from about 0.1 percent to about 5 percent by weight of the weight of the dentifrice base.

The film matrix of the present invention is rupturable during tooth brushing so that flavors, sweeteners as well as therapeutic agents may be maintained substantially separate from the dentifrice ingredients during manufacture and storage, while subsequently being released when the dentifrice is applied topically to tooth surfaces, the mechanical agitation created during tooth brushing effecting rupture of the film matrix whereby the entrained ingredient is released to the tooth surface.

Cosmetic Agents

Flavor agents incorporated in the film matrix of the present invention are known to the prior art, such as natural and artificial flavors. These flavorings may be chosen from synthetic flavor oils and flavoring aromatics, and/or oils, oleo resins and extracts derived from plants, leaves, flowers, fruits and so forth, and combinations thereof. Representative flavor oils include: spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, clove oil, bay oil, thyme oil, cedar leaf oil, oil of nutmeg, oil of sage, and oil of bitter almonds. These flavor agents can be used individually or in admixture. Commonly used flavors include mints such as peppermint, artificial vanilla, cinnamon derivatives, and various fruit flavors, whether employed individually or in admixture. Generally, any flavoring or food additive, such as those described in Chemicals Used in Food Processing, publication 1274 by the National Academy of Sciences, pages 63-258, may be used. Generally the flavoring agent is incorporated in the film of the present invention in an amount ranging from about 1 to about 30% by weight and preferably about 15 to about 25% by weight.

Sweeteners may also be incorporated in the film matrices of the present invention include both natural and artificial sweeteners. Suitable sweetener include water soluble sweetening agents such as monosaccharides, disaccharides and plysaccharides such as xylose, ribose, glucose (dextrose), mannose, glatose, fructose (levulose), sucrose (sugar), maltose, water soluble artificial sweeteners such as the soluble saccharin salts, i.e., sodium or calcium saccharin salts, cyclamate salts dipeptide based sweeteners, such a L-aspartic acid derived sweeteners, such as L-aspartyl-L-phenylalaine methyl ester (aspartame).

In general, the effective amount of sweetener is utilized to provide the level of sweetness desired for a particular film matrix composition, will vary with the sweetener selected. This amount will normally be about 0.01% to about 2% by weight of the composition.

Therapeutic Agents

Therapeutic agents incorporated in the film flake matrix of the present invention are compounds that are reactive with dentifrice ingredients and must therefore be isolated from the dentifrice ingredients during manufacture and storage.

The therapeutic agents entrained in the film matrix maintained substantially separate from the ingredients of the base dentifrice during manufacture and storage are subsequently released into the dentifrice during tooth brushing. Entrainment of the therapeutic agent in the film matrix prevents premature leakage into the dentifrice so that in the case of therapeutic agents which are reactive ingredients, interaction with dentifrice ingredients is avoided.

For example, reaction of a cationic therapeutic agent such as cetyl pyridinium chloride or chlorhexidene with an anionic surfactant such as sodium lauryl sulfate, which surfactant is conventionally included in dentifrice compositions, inactivates the therapeutic agent thereby reducing the antibacterial efficacy of the dentifrice composition.

In the use of fluoride salts as anticavities agents, one of the methods used to achieve enhanced fluoridation known to the art (U.S. Pat. No. 5,045,305 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,145,668), is to mix, immediately before use, separate solutions containing fluoride and calcium salts. Such a procedure is a time consuming daily chore which discourages its use. Combining the calcium and fluoride salts into a single dentifrice composition will not provide an effective means for fluoridation as the presence of the calcium salt reacts with and removes bioactive soluble ionic fluoride from the dentifrice by forming insoluble and inactive calcium fluoride thereby reducing the antiocariogenic effectiveness of the fluoride dentifrice. Incorporating the calcium salt in the flakes formed from the film matrix of the present invention isolates the fluoride ion in the dentifrice from interaction with the calcium salt until the film matrix disintegrates during tooth brushing.

Typically, in the case of calcium salts, these salts are present in the film flake matrix in an amount up to about 30% by weight, based on the weight of the film matrix, and preferably in the amount of about 18% to 22%.

In addition to fluoride or calcium salts, there may also be included in the film flake matrix anticalculus agents such as pyrophosphate salts including dialkali or tetraalkali metal pyrophosphate salts such as Na4P207, K4P207, Na2K2P207,Na2H2P207and K2H2P207, long chain polyphosphates such as sodium hexametaphosphate and cyclic phosphates such as sodium trimetaphosphate which are included in the film matrix at a concentration of about 15 to 20% by weight.

Other active agents which may be incorporated it he film matrix of this invention include antibacterial agents such as Triclosan, breath freshening agents such as zinc gluconate, zinc citrate and/or alpha ionone, desensitizers such as potassium nitrate, vitamins such as pantheon, retinyl palmitate, tocopherol acetate, herbs such as chamomilla recutita, mentha piperita, salvia officinalis, commiphora myrrha, whitening agents such as hydrogen peroxide and urea peroxide, high cleaning silica, preservatives, silicones, chlorophyll compounds.

The active agents are incorporated in the film matrix of the present invention at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 2.0% by weight and preferably about 0.15 to about 5% by weight. The present invention is illustrated by the following examples.

Base Dentifrice Composition

In the preparation of the base dentifrice in accordance with the present invention there is utilized an orally acceptable vehicle, including a water-phase with humectant which is preferably glycerine or sorbitol or an alkylene glycol such as polyethylene glycol or propylene glycol, wherein the water is present typically in amount of about 5 to about 10% by weight and the glycerine, sorbitol and/or the alkylene glycol ingredients typically total about 30 to about 80% by weight of the dentifrice, more typically about 50 to about 70% by weight.

The base dentifrice also contains an inorganic or a natural or synthetic thickener or gelling agent in proportions of about 0.10 to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.2 to about 1% by weight. These proportions of thickeners in the dentifrice compositions of the present invention in which the film flakes of the present invention are suspended are sufficient to form an extrudable, shape-retaining product which can be squeezed from a tube onto a toothbrush and will not fall between the bristles of the brush but rather, will substantially maintain its shape thereon. Suitable thickeners or gelling agents useful in the practice of the present invention include inorganic thickening silicas such as amorphous silicas available from Huber Corporation under the trade designation Zeodent 165, Irish moss, iota-carrageenan, gum tragacanth, and polyvinylpyrrolidone.

Polishing agents such as silica, calcined alumina, sodium bicarbonate, calcium carbonate, dicalcium phosphate and calcium pyrophosphate may be included in the base dentifrice compositions used in the practice of the present invention. Visually clear dentifrice compositions are obtained by using polishing agents such as collodial silica, such as those sold under the trade designation Zeodent 115 available from the Huber Corporation or alkali metal aluminosilicate complexes (that is, silica containing alumina combined in its matrix) which have refractive indices close to the refractive indices of gelling agent-liquid (including water and/or humectant) systems used in dentifrice compositions.

The polishing agent is generally present in the base dentifrice composition in weight concentrations of about 3% to about 50% by weight.

Surfactants are used in the base dentifrice compositions of the present invention to achieve increased prophylactic action and render the instant compositions more cosmetically acceptable. Suitable examples of surfactants include water-soluble salts of higher fatty acid monoglyceride monosulfates, such as the sodium salt of the monsulfated monoglyceride of hydrogenated coconut oil fatty acids, cocamidopropyl betaine, higher alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate, alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, higher alkyl sulfoacetates, sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, higher fatty acid esters of 1,2-dihydroxy propane sulfonate, and the substantially saturated higher aliphatic acyl amides of lower aliphatic amino carboxylic acid compounds, such as those having 12 to 16 carbons in the fatty acid, alkyl or acyl radicals, and the like. Examples of the last mentioned amides are N-lauroyl sarcosine, and the sodium, potassium, and ethanolamine salts of N-lauroyl, N-myristoyl, or N-palmitoyl sarcosine.

The anionic surfactants are typically present in the dentifrice compositions of the present invention in an amount of about 0.3to about 5% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 2.0% by weight.

To prepare the dentifrice base of the present invention, water, humectants, e.g. glycerin, sorbitol polyethylene glycol are dispersed in a conventional mixer until the mixture becomes a homogeneous gel phase. Into the gel phase are added the polishing agent. These ingredients are mixed until a homogeneous phase is obtained. Thereafter the thickener, any flavor and surfactant ingredients are added and the ingredients mixed at high speed until vacuum of about 20 to 100 mmHg. The shaped film flakes are added to the dentifrice constituents as a last step, so as to minimize the shear to which the dentifrice ingredients are subjected to during the prior mixing steps.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, in particular, to a toothbrush with a powered head having fixed and movable tuft blocks.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which tooth cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the tooth cleaning elements are attached.

Conventional toothbrushes have tooth cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and guns by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the tooth cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the tooth cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

I would be desirable to provide a powered toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY

The principles of the invention may be used to advantage to provide a powered toothbrush with a least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In accordance with a first aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. At least one fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to each fixed tuft block and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block with respect to each fixed tuft block

In accordance with another aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and is spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first fixed tuft block and the second fixed tuft block by an elastomeric member. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner with respect to the first and second fixed tuft blocks.

In accordance with a further aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to a distal end of the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to a proximate end of the head in a fixed orientation and spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first tuft block and the second tuft block by an elastomeric membrane and has a base portion including a slot. A battery is mounted inside the handle, and a motor is operably connected to the batter. A drive shaft is rotatably driven by the motor and has an offset portion that engages the slot in the movable tuft block to drive the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner.

Substantial advantage is achieved by providing a powered toothbrush with at least one tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In particular, certain embodiments improve cleaning of teeth and gums, and provide improved access to and contact with areas of the teeth located at a distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between the teeth.

These and additional features and advantages disclosed here will be further understood from the following detailed disclosure of certain embodiments.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a diagnostic test device such as a pregnancy test device or a device such as for detection of a disease state, from a liquid biological sample. It may, for example, find application as a point of care (POC) diagnostic tool or other test device or for over-the-counter (OTC) sale. In such contexts, it is preferably a disposable device.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

It is now commonplace to provide a disposable diagnostic device for the analysis of a single analyte or multiple analytes that originate from a liquid biological sample. Examples of such devices include pregnancy tests and glucose meters for diabetics. In the case of a typical pregnancy test, urine is applied to a wick or collection zone, upon which the sample interacts and mixes with an antibody, or antibodies that specifically recognise the analyte of interest. One of the aforementioned antibodies is always coupled to a colourmetric indicator (often a gold sol or latex particle) for the visual interpretation of a result and often considered as the primary antibody.

The sample and the released components pass through the associated materials (often nitrocellulose) in a lateral flow manner. Deposited on to the nitrocellulose are two zones (or lines) of capture molecules. The first zone (or line) is often the second antibody of a pair that detects the presence of the analyte of interest, however in some embodiments this line is composed of avidin or streptavidin that binds to a biotin coupled to antibody. The second line is often deemed as a control line, and comprises an antibody that specifically recognises the primary antibody or a component bound to the surface of the colourmetric indicator.

The intensity of the first line of the two mentioned above is proportional to the quantity of analyte of interest present in the biological sample. This is deemed as the test line. The second line is used to confirm whether the test has operated correctly, by releasing the reagents, and fluid migrating appropriately. Together the lines represent the manner through which data can be extracted from the immobilised immunoassay that takes place within the device.

In purely visual (i.e. human eye dependent) test devices, a non-skilled user can be confused when a positive result is weak, it could be missed by the user, and considered as a negative, or provide the user with an ambiguous result leading to uncertainty. This may lead to inappropriate conclusions.

It would therefore be desirable to provide an automated, preferably electronic, detector system whereby the risk of inaccuracy can be reduced in terms of determining more reliably, whether there is sufficient contrast (colour change) between a test or control line zone and background and also, to ensure that the line intensities are read/interpreted at the appropriate time post sample application.

Furthermore, our unpublished co-pending application GB0603665.1 discloses the detection of active protease enzyme using a modified lateral flow immunoassay.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,461 discloses a portable analysis device comprising a housing and an optical system consisting of a light source and a photodetector. One or more test elements are mounted on a support strip and are used to perform an assay on a sample. The support is then placed in the housing and is caused to move relative to the housing and the optical system so that the photodetector produces a change in output signal indicative of the reaction of at least one of the test elements in response to the presence of a predetermined analyte in the sample.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus, the present invention provides a diagnostic test device comprising means for sampling a liquid biological sample, means for reacting the sample with at least one reagent to provide one or more visible indicia and an optical detector for detecting the presence of said one or more indicia, the device further comprising a releasable tether which is released by contact with the liquid sample, thereby to cause the optical detector to detect the said one or more indicia.

The releasable tether is preferably formed of a material which disintegrates when wet, eg a water-soluble or water-friable material.

Preferably, the complete device, including electronic circuitry, is formed integrally in a unitary device. Alternatively, it may be embodied as a device which does not include the circuitry for processing the photodetector output and that circuitry may then be housed in a separate unit into which the device is plugged to obtain a readout.

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid. Preferably, the gold colloid has a mean particle size of about 60 nm to about 80 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to powered toothbrushes, and more particularly, to a toothbrush having a head with two distinct moving sections that each provide oral health benefits to the user.

2. Discussion of Related Art

Toothbrushes provide many oral hygiene benefits. For example, toothbrushes remove plaque and food debris to help avoid tooth decay and disease. They remove stained pellicle from the surface of each tooth to help whiten the teeth. Also, the bristles combined with the brushing motion massage the gingival tissue for stimulation and increased health of the tissue.

Powered toothbrushes have been available for some time. Powered toothbrushes have advantages over manual (non-powered) toothbrushes in that they impart movement to the bristles at much higher speeds than possible manually. They also may impart different types and directions of motion. These motions, generally in combination with manual movement of toothbrush by the user, provide superior cleaning than manual toothbrushes. Typically, powered toothbrushes are powered by disposable or rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor that in turn drives toothbrush head.

Known powered toothbrushes include a brush head with a bristle carrier portion that rotates, oscillates or vibrates in some manner so as to clean the teeth. The bristles, which typically comprise bristle tufts, are generally uniform with one end fixed into the bristle carrier portion and the other end free to contact the surface of the teeth while brushing. The free ends of the various tufts present a surface envelope that is capable of some deformation when the bristles bend. When in contact with the surface to be brushed, the bristles may deform so that the surface envelope tends to conform to the complex surface of the teeth. Human teeth generally lie in a “C” shaped curve within the upper and lower jaw, and each row of teeth consequently has a convex outer curve and a concave inner curve. Individual teeth often have extremely complex surfaces, with areas that may be flat, concave, or convex. The more precise conformation between the bristles and the tooth surface, the more effective toothbrush may be in cleaning, whitening and/or stimulating.

Known powered toothbrushes typically arrange the bristles in a compact conical or cylindrical pattern on a generally circular, disk-shaped bristle carrier. The powered toothbrush heads are traditionally compact, generally oval in shape and heads are produced with a flat trimmed bristle pattern. Alternatively, other head shapes and bristle patterns are available.

One example of a powered toothbrush is depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 to McDougall, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. Toothbrush shown in McDougall has a disc-shaped bristle carrier. The bristle carrier, and thus the bristles, are driven in a vibrating or oscillating manner. This type of toothbrush is described herein with reference toFIGS. 1A-1C. A toothbrush5includes a handle portion10at a proximal end of toothbrush5and a head11at a distal end of toothbrush5. Handle portion10has compartments for containing a powered motor14and batteries15and16. Head11includes a generally circular bristle holder (carrier)13. A rotatable shaft12extends from the motor14to head11. A shaft coupling17may be located along the shaft12and configured to provide for the shaft12to be separated at a point between the motor14and head11. This permits the shaft to be removed from toothbrush5, e.g., for cleaning, servicing, or replacement.

Head11includes a post18that provides a rotational pivot axis for the bristle holder13containing bristle tufts19. The distal end of the shaft12has a journal or offset20that is radially displaced from the longitudinal axis of the shaft12, which may be integrally formed therewith. The bristle holder13has a slot22that receives the offset20. The offset20and slot22are configured so as to be oriented toward the intersection of the shaft12axis and the longitudinal axis of the post18. When the motor14rotates the shaft12, the motion of the offset20defines a circle about the shaft12axis and drivingly engages slot22such that the bristle holder13vibrates or oscillates about the post18axis through a rotational angle A. The rotational angle A is defined by the displacement of the offset20from the shaft12axis relative to the diameter of the bristle holder13.

Although powered toothbrushes such as those described immediately above provide advantages over manual toothbrushes, they are subject to various limitations. Providing a rotating or oscillating bristle holder (carrier) with a typical oblong or oval toothbrush head constrains the size of the moving bristle holder, and consequently the area of bristles available for teeth cleaning. Also, when the bristles are placed in contact with the teeth during brushing, there is less bristle contact with adjacent areas, such as the gums. Thus, while these compact bristle patterns provide for cleaning, there is minimal whitening and stimulation.

One attempt to overcome the limitations associated with a small powered bristle area is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,083 to Blaustein et al. The toothbrush in Blaustein et al. has a bristle area and pattern similar to a manual toothbrush, but an area of the bristles has simply been replaced by a powered bristle section. The result is that the head has a powered or moving bristle section and static bristle section. The limitation of Blaustein et al. is that the static bristle section provides no better cleaning, whitening or stimulation than a manual toothbrush.

International Application No. PCT/EPO1/07615 of Braun GmbH discloses a powered toothbrush with two separate bristle parts that can move. Each bristle part can have a different range and/or type of motion. However, only one bristle part is powered. The other unpowered bristle part moves due to a resonance effect imparted by the frequency of the movement of the first bristle part.

This free resonance causes a number of difficulties. First, because any contact between the bristle parts will dampen or cancel any resonance of the unpowered bristle part, the unpowered bristle part “floats” separately from the powered bristle part. This necessitates separation or gaps between them. These gaps expose the internal workings of the head to foreign matter such as water, saliva, toothpaste, and food particles. This foreign matter may interfere with the workings of the unpowered bristle head. For example, the unpowered bristle part is spring-loaded to assist its resonance. Foreign matter may accumulate on or around the spring, interfering with its function. In addition, food particles may remain in the head and may fester and host microorganisms, which are undesirable if not potentially harmful when introduced directly into the mouth.

Another limitation of such a design is that movement of the unpowered bristle part may be damped by contact with the teeth, or lessened when the frequency of the powered part shifts from the resonance frequency. This can occur due to pressure imparted against the powered bristle part by the teeth or gums during brushing. Finally, the energy imparted to the unpowered bristle part is only a portion of the energy input into the powered part. Therefore, the unpowered bristle part is less effective in cleaning than the powered part, limiting the overall effectiveness of the toothbrush.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a powered toothbrush with increased effectiveness through a larger area of powered or driven bristles or bristles that are otherwise movable. There is also a need for a toothbrush having increased whitening and/or stimulation than known toothbrushes. There is further a need for such improved toothbrushes to be comparable in manufacturing and purchasing costs as known powered toothbrushes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A powered toothbrush is provided and includes a handle portion at a proximal end and either a fixed head or a linkage for receiving a removable head at a distal end thereof. A neck is further formed between handle portion and head. According to one embodiment of the invention, the head includes two distinct movable parts that each and together provide oral health benefits, each being adapted to have a number of bristles or elastomeric cleaning members extending therefrom adapted to contact surfaces of one or more teeth and surrounding areas. The powered toothbrush is further formed with a drive mechanism that imparts movement to the first movable part to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening action that supplements the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush. The first movable part in turn imparts movement to the second movable part.

In one embodiment, the first movable head part is a first bristle carrier that supports a number of bristle tufts, elastomeric cleaning members, or a combination thereof. The first bristle carrier is operatively mounted to head and is coupled to the drive mechanism such that the first bristle carrier oscillates back and forth in a direction parallel to toothbrush head. Preferably, the oscillating first bristle carrier is moved back and forth in a rotational direction. The second movable part is formed as a second carrier that includes an elastomeric platform that is operatively fixedly mounted at at least one portion thereof to the head and is selectively engaged by the first carrier to provide movement. The second carrier thus oscillates and translates in a direction parallel and longitudinal to the head, thereby providing a moving head section in addition to the oscillating section that is formed by the first bristle carrier.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the foregoing detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or more of such steps with respect to each of the others, and the apparatus embodying features of construction, combination(s) of elements and arrangement of parts that are adapted to effect such steps, all as exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to liquid cleaning compositions in the form of microemulsions or microemulsion preconcentrates that have efficient degreasing and drainage capabilities. e.g., for use in cleaning kitchenware.

Microemulsions are stable liquid dispersions of water and oil, together with one or more surfactants and co-surfactants, usually homogeneous and (due to the small size of the microemulsion droplets) transparent. Microemulsions form spontaneously when the correct components (e.g., water, oil, and appropriate surfactant/co-surfactant) are present. Because of their thermodynamic stability and their ability to take up relatively high volumes of oily substances, e.g., in the internal phase of the particles in an oil-in-water microemulsion, microemulsion systems are of interest for cleaning solutions, such as dishwashing and other cleaning solutions for surfaces having high amounts of oil and grease. An ongoing need exists for improved microemulsion systems that yield beneficial cleaning effects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to powered toothbrushes, and more particularly, to a powered toothbrush having a curved neck of a constant curvature and a curved flexible shaft.

2. Discussion of Related Art

Toothbrushes provide many oral hygiene benefits. For example, toothbrushes remove plaque and food debris to help avoid tooth decay and disease. They remove stained pellicle from the surface of each tooth to help whiten the teeth. Also, the bristles combined with the brushing motion massage the gingival tissue for stimulation and increased health of the tissue.

Powered toothbrushes have been available for some time. Powered toothbrushes have advantages over manual (non-powered) toothbrushes in that they impart movement to the bristles at much higher speeds than possible manually. They also may impart different types and directions of motion. These motions, generally in combination with manual movement of the toothbrush by a user, provide superior cleaning than manual toothbrushes. Typically, powered toothbrushes are powered by disposable or rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor that in turn drives a toothbrush head.

Known powered toothbrushes include a brush head with a bristle carrier portion that rotates, oscillates or vibrates in some manner so as to clean the teeth. The bristles, which typically comprise bristle tufts, are generally uniform with one end fixed into the bristle carrier portion and the other end free to contact the surface of the teeth while brushing. The free ends of the various tufts present a surface envelope that is capable of some deformation when the bristles bend. When in contact with the surface to be brushed, the bristles may deform so that the surface envelope tends to conform to the complex surface of the teeth. Human teeth generally lie in a “C” shaped curve within the upper and lower jaw bones, and each row of teeth consequently has a convex outer curve and a concave inner curve. Individual teeth often have extremely complex surfaces, with areas that may be flat, concave or convex. The more precise the contact between the bristles and the tooth surface, the more effective the toothbrush may be in cleaning, whitening and/or stimulating.

Although powered toothbrushes such as those described immediately above provide advantages over manual toothbrushes, they are not designed for engaging teeth in hard to reach areas of the mouth. Further, the shafts of such powered toothbrushes are not designed to allow for efficient contact between the bristles and the tooth surface. Additionally, such powered toothbrushes utilize multiple, segmented drive shafts coupled to gears, which complicate the powered toothbrush and increase the failure rate.

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION

Therefore, it is an object of the invention to provide a powered toothbrush which avoids the aforementioned deficiencies of the prior art.

It is also an object of this invention to provide a powered toothbrush with improved ergonomic design.

It is another object of this invention to provide a powered toothbrush with a curved neck of a constant curvature and a single flexible shaft.

It is a further object of this invention to provide a powered toothbrush wherein the single flexible shaft is not engaged to gears.

It is still another object of this invention to provide a powered toothbrush with a clutch mechanism.

Various other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become readily apparent from the ensuing detailed description and the novel features will be particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a powered toothbrush which has been designed to clean teeth in hard to reach areas of the mouth. The powered toothbrush of this invention includes a handle portion having a base member at one end thereof. A curved neck portion extends from the other end of the handle portion with a head coupled to the neck. The head includes at least one bristle carrier connected to a flexible drive shaft for moving the at least one carrier in a first rotatable direction. In a preferred embodiment, the powered toothbrush includes two bristle carriers.

In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a powered toothbrush is provided having a handle having an inner cavity formed therein and a base member at one end thereof; a rotary drive member disposed within said inner cavity; a curved tubular neck portion extending from the other end of said handle portion with a head coupled to the neck portion, the head including at least one bristle carrier having bristles, wherein the at least one said bristle carriers is adapted to move in a first rotational direction; and a flexible drive shaft for moving the at least one bristle carrier in a first rotational direction, having a first end and a second end, rotatably disposed within said curved tubular neck portion, the first end thereof being drivably connected to said drive member and the second end thereof extending through the outer end of said curved tubular neck portion, said flexible drive shaft being rotationally responsive to said rotary drive member.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a diagnostic test device such as a pregnancy test device or a device such as for detection of a disease state, from a liquid biological sample. It may, for example, find application as a point of care (POC) diagnostic tool or other test device or for over-the-counter (OTC) sale. In such contexts, it is preferably a disposable device.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

It is now commonplace to provide a disposable diagnostic device for the analysis of a single analyte or multiple analytes that originate from a liquid biological sample. Examples of such devices include pregnancy tests and glucose meters for diabetics. In the case of a typical pregnancy test, urine is applied to a wick or collection zone, upon which the sample interacts and mixes with an antibody, or antibodies that specifically recognise the analyte of interest. One of the aforementioned antibodies is always coupled to a colourmetric indicator (often a gold sol or latex particle) for the visual interpretation of a result and often considered as the primary antibody.

The sample and the released components pass through the associated materials (often nitrocellulose) in a lateral flow manner. Deposited on to the nitrocellulose are two zones (or lines) of capture molecules. The first zone (or line) is often the second antibody of a pair that detects the presence of the analyte of interest, however in some embodiments this line is composed of avidin or streptavidin that binds to a biotin coupled to antibody. The second line is often deemed as a control line, and comprises an antibody that specifically recognises the primary antibody or a component bound to the surface of the colourmetric indicator.

The intensity of the first line of the two mentioned above is proportional to the quantity of analyte of interest present in the biological sample. This is deemed as the test line. The second line is used to confirm whether the test has operated correctly, by releasing the reagents, and fluid migrating appropriately. Together the lines represent the manner through which data can be extracted from the solid phase immunoassay that takes place within the device.

In purely visual (i.e. human eye dependent) test devices, a non-skilled user can be confused when a positive result is weak, it could be missed by the user, and considered as a negative, or provide the user with an ambiguous result leading to uncertainty. This may lead to inappropriate conclusions.

It would therefore be desirable to provide an automated, preferably electronic, detector system whereby the risk of inaccuracy can be reduced in terms of determining more reliably, whether there is sufficient contrast (colour change) between a test or control line and background and also, to ensure that the line intensities are read/interpreted at the appropriate time post sample application.

Furthermore, our unpublished co-pending application GB0603665.1 discloses the detection of active protease enzyme using a modified lateral flow immunoassay.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,791,461 discloses a portable analysis device comprising a housing and an optical system consisting of a light source and a photodetector. One or more test elements are mounted on a support strip and are used to perform an assay on a sample. The support is then placed in the housing and is caused to move relative to the housing and the optical system so that the photodetector produces a change in output signal indiciative of the reaction of at least one of the test elements in response to the presence of a predetermined analyte in the sample.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Thus, the present invention provides a diagnostic test device comprising means for sampling a liquid biological sample, means for reacting the sample with at least one reagent to provide one or more visible indicia in a detection zone and an optical detector for detecting the presence of said one or more indicia, the device further comprising means for causing at least part of the optical detector to move over the detection region. Preferably, these components are formed as parts of a structure which is a unitary structure before sampling is effected.

Preferably, the complete device, including electronic circuitry, is formed integrally in a unitary device. Alternatively, it may be embodied as a device which does not include the circuitry for processing the photodetector output and that circuitry may then be housed in a separate unit into which the device is plugged to obtain a readout.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to novel skin care formulations containing low concentrations of long chain acids, e.g., fatty acids, and polyvalent metal ions, suitable for use in the bath or shower and capable of delivering moisturizing and other beneficial ingredients to the skin and providing improved skin feel even after rinsing.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Skin care compositions, for example skin moisturizing compositions, are typically aqueous formulations comprising an emulsified oil which is stabilized with surfactant. Ideally, moisturizing compositions are best applied to the skin when the skin is wet and saturated with water, but a disadvantage of conventional formulations in this respect is that they are immediately and entirely rinsed off when applied in the shower or bath. Oil-based skin care formulations which are essentially free of surfactants, on the other hand, may resist rinsing, but can form a relatively thick and aesthetically unpleasing layer of oil on the skin.

There is a need for a skin care formulation which can be applied when the skin is wet, e.g., in the shower or bath, but which can be substantially rinsed off while leaving sufficient moisturizing or conditioning agent to protect the skin and provide a long-lasting moisturizing effect.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides skin care formulations which can be administered in the bath or shower, depositing a thin layer of moisturizing or other conditioning agents on application, which is not rinsed off but remains to protect the skin from drying, resulting in smoother, softer skin feel. The formulations of the invention comprise polyvalent metal cations and long chain acids, which react on application in the shower or bath to form a thin deposit of insoluble salts, thereby enhancing the retention of moisturizing oils and conditioning agents.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant or deodorant formulations have been developed with a range of different product forms. One of these is a so-called “stick” which is usually a bar of an apparently firm solid material held within a dispensing container and which retains its structural integrity and shape whilst being applied. When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface, a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface. Payout, of a deodorant stick, describes the weight lost to a surface from a typical application of the deodorant stick. This attribute and other rheological properties are considerations when developing new stick deodorant products. Therefore, a controlled method and device for measuring such properties is desirable.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In an embodiment of the present invention, a system for measuring any or all of payout, static friction and kinetic friction is disclosed. The system includes at least one substrate positioned on an XYZ translational substrate bed. The system includes a sample holder for supporting a sample, wherein the sample holder and the sample are positioned perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed. The system further includes a force device placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder; the predetermined weight determines a contact force placed by the sample onto the substrate. The system also includes frictionless bearing table connected to the sample holder and a stationary frictionless bearing table positioned parallel to the XYZ translational substrate bed. The sample holder and the stationary frictionless bearing table are connected to a friction sensor. The system also includes a balance for obtaining a first substrate weight before movement of the XYZ translational substrate bed and a second substrate weight after movement of the XYZ translational substrate bed.

The system further includes a controller operably coupled to the moving substrate bed and the friction sensor and configured to execute a machine readable program code containing executable instructions.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring payout is disclosed. The method comprises positioning a substrate of pre-known weight on an XYZ translational substrate bed; supporting a sample in a sample holder, wherein the sample is perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed; placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder so that the sample and substrate form a contact point; first moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a first sweep speed in a first direction relative to the sample; second moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a second sweep speed in a second direction relative to the sample; conducting the first moving and the second moving for a predetermined number of cycle(s); obtaining a second substrate weight of the substrate after the predetermined number of cycles; and determining a payout value based on the first substrate weight and the second substrate weight.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring one or more of static friction and kinetic friction is provided. The method comprises: positioning a substrate of pre-known weight on an XYZ translational substrate bed; supporting a sample in a sample holder, wherein the sample is perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed; placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder so that the sample and substrate form a contact point; first moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a first sweep speed in a first direction relative to the sample; second moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a second sweep speed in a second direction relative to the sample: conducting the first moving and the second moving for a predetermined number of cycle(s); during the first moving step and the second moving step, measuring one or more friction values at the contact point; analyzing one or more friction values generated at the sample contact point during the first moving step and the second moving step; and determining one or more of a static friction value and a kinetic friction value based on the one or more friction values.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring flakeoff is provided. The method comprises: providing a wool sample of a predetermined size; applying an initial weight of a material to the wool sample; attaching a first end of the wool to a stationary holder and a second end to a movable substrate bed; a stretching step comprising moving the movable substrate bed a predetermined distance and returning and then moving it to an opposite direction for the same predetermined distance and returning for 1 stretch; repeating the stretch step for a predetermined number of stretches; measuring the weight of the wool sample and material after the predetermined number of stretches; determining a weight loss of material from the wool sample as measured by an amount of material lost from the sample divided by the initial weight of material after the predetermined number of stretches.

In each of the above methods, the methods are conducted on the above described system.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a toothbrush, either manual or powered, which includes a handle and a head. Cleaning elements are mounted to the head such as tufts of bristles and/or elastomeric wipers. When toothpaste is applied to the cleaning elements the user inserts the head into the mouth and brushes the teeth in a known manner.

The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts, bundles or other groupings. A goal of many toothbrushes is to accommodate the cleaning element profile to that of the teeth being cleaned. Achieving that goal is complicated by the difficulty in matching a toothbrush profile to the complex surface of a typical set of human teeth. The latter generally lie in a “C” shaped curve which presents the need for a brush to address a convex outer curve and a concave inner curve. In addition, the toothbrush should be capable of cleaning irregularities on the tooth surface as well as the interproximal area between teeth.

Various approaches have been taken in the prior art to accommodate the complex shape of the human mouth and the attendant difficulties in cleaning teeth and gums within the mouth. One approach to this problem is provision of a flexible toothbrush head.

Blakeman U.S. Pat. No. 2,706,825 issued Apr. 26, 1955 discloses a replaceable bristle head for a toothbrush. The flexible head undulates in a manner so that rows of bristles move in a direction aligned with the axis of the toothbrush handle.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,651,158 issued Jul. 29, 1997 to Hans Halm discloses a toothbrush handle with a segmented head wherein adjoining segments are linked by an elastomeric material. The segments are primarily oriented transverse to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush but may also be oriented parallel to that axis.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,408,476 discloses another form of segmented toothbrush head with transverse grooves and an elastomeric portion joining the segments. A method of manufacturing this head is also disclosed.

The use of elastomeric material within folds of a toothbrush handle is the subject of U.S. Pat. No. 5,903,949.

International Publication Number WO96/02165 dated Feb. 1, 1996 discloses a resiliently flexible bristle-bearing toothbrush head containing bristles with a generally concave surface. The head, being flexible, can flex under the action of tooth brushing to accommodate the varying profiles of users' teeth. Grooves transverse or parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush which are filled with elastomeric material permit flexure along the length or across the breath of the head (pages 4-5).

A tip region of a toothbrush head is flexibly mounted to the rigid balance of the head in the disclosure of International Publication Number WO 97/07707 dated Mar. 6, 1997. A flexible plastic material forms the link (hinge) which connects the two parts of the head (pages 2-3). In use, the tip region of the head can fold backwards toward the rigid balance of the head, thereby enabling the head to better accommodate itself to the curved shape of the user's teeth.

Another flexible toothbrush head is disclosed n European Patent Specification No. EP 0577 656 B1 published May 4, 1997.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A common theme among the aforementioned approaches to providing a flexible head is the use of different materials throughout the head to achieve the desired flexibility. Most of the above cited art use elastomeric materials at joints in the head structure to provide that flexibility. This invention proposes to achieve flexibility while using a homogeneous material for the head, rather than separate portions of the head with varying physical properties. This approach offers considerable simplification of a flexible toothbrush head assembly.

The preferred material for forming the head has sufficient rigidity to maintain the structure of the head and retain the cleaning elements in place within the head while still offering the desired flexibility. This desired mix of properties can be achieved by blending two or more materials prior to molding. A preferred blend uses a large percentage (up to about 50%) of a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) with polypropylene. The percentages of the respective components would be governed by the geometry of the head, with a thinner head generally needing less TPE for flexibility.

Because a softer material is used in the head, retention of cleaning elements in the head may require special attention. Therefore, special care should be taken in staple insertion to properly anchor the cleaning elements. Alternatively, groups or tufts of cleaning elements can be secured in the flexible head of this invention using the injection molding technique (IMT) for placement and securement of toothbrush bristles. In the IMT process, the bristles are preferably attached during formation of the toothbrush handle, or at least during formation of the head.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to a calcium fortified syrup, and more particularly, to a syrup fortified with micronized calcium, especially micronized tricalcium phosphate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Calcium is essential for building and maintaining bone strength, nerve transmission to the muscles, serving as a catalyst for the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and activating a number of enzymes including lipase. Calcium deficiency can lead to osteoporosis in the elderly. Additionally, protection against high blood pressure and colon cancer have been attributed to calcium. The U.S. Recommended Daily Allowance, commonly referred to as the Reference Daily Intake (“RDI”), of calcium is 1000 mg for adults and children 12 or more years of age.

Calcium and other minerals and vitamins have been used to fortify foods to obtain general health benefits. To get enough calcium for growing bones, the percent Daily Value for calcium should add up to 120 percent. Foods fortified with calcium are considered to offer the same net effect as calcium naturally found in food.

Dairy products are recognized as a rich source of dietary calcium. Both milk and ice cream have been fortified with calcium. Calcium fortification of milk is disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,871,123, 4,701,329, 4,840,814 and 4,851,243; see also Anon, Boosting Milk's Calcium, 99 Dairy Foods 36, 1998. For example, milk has been fortified with calcium carbonate, calcium gluconate and milk calcium in powdered form.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,002,779 to Mehansho describes addition of calcium to dry chocolate powers such as cocoa. Carrageenan gum has been used for suspension of calcium carbonate. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,701,329 and 4,851,243 disclose calcium-enriched and phosphorus-enriched fortified milk by the addition of tri-basic calcium phosphate, carrageenan and guar gum to milk. The hydration of the gums is necessary to assure uniform distribution of the added materials in the milk.

However, there are many obstacles associated with adding calcium to syrups that make it very difficult to utilize. For example, when added directly to syrup as a salt without being subjected to any further treatment, many of the calcium salts, which are insoluble or substantially insoluble at around neutral pH, e.g., calcium carbonate, calcium phosphates, calcium citrate and other organic or inorganic acid salts of calcium, precipitate out of the syrup or impart to the syrup a gritty chalky mouthfeel. Fortification with calcium is a significant challenge, especially in foods, such as syrups, which are ingested in small serving sizes. Syrups are packaged in standard 24 ounce bottles which include approximately 16 servings per bottle. The smaller serving size and the higher number of servings in a container for syrups is a problem since a high concentration of calcium is necessary in the small volume if it is being used to fortify this food. Also problematic is the availability of calcium from various salt ingredients. Typically, the amount of calcium in various salt forms only ranges from 20-40% based on the source.

An additional problem with calcium fortification is that most calcium sources, such as calcium carbonate, have a very poor solubility in water or in neutral pH solutions. Calcium that is very soluble in orange juice, for example, will not be soluble in chocolate syrup. Syrups are typically low water mixtures, that is, there is not a lot of available water. This poor solubility coupled with low water availability in syrups prevents calcium from becoming soluble in the system. When incorporating calcium into liquids, the source of calcium is usually in finely divided form which further promotes precipitation thereof upon extended storage.

Syrups are products which typically are expected to have much longer shelf lives than products such as milk or yogurt. The addition of untreated calcium salts to syrups causes the syrup to have a gritty texture; moreover sedimentation of calcium on the bottom of the container is likely to occur during processing and/or shelf life. More soluble calcium salts or even the use of suspended sources of calcium tends to result in off flavors, adverse appearance, and undesirable increases in viscosity. Generally, the more soluble the salt or the more finely divided it is so as to improve supendability, the quicker or more easily the off-taste will be detected. Also, solubilization of the calcium increases the likelihood of it being complexed with or interacting with other components of the syrup or other foods consumed with it. Additionally, complexation or interaction of the calcium may result in it being less susceptible to absorption in the blood.

Therefore, there is a need for a calcium fortified syrup which is flavor neutral and not unpleasant tasting or gritty and from which the calcium does not separate out.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It is an object of the present invention to fortify syrup with calcium.

It is also an object of the present invention to fortify syrup product with calcium, with a high concentrations of calcium so that one serving provides at least 10% of the RDI while maintaining a calcium suspension and preventing and/or retarding separation of calcium therefrom.

It is yet another object of the present invention to fortify syrup with calcium where the calcium is flavor neutral and is not unpleasant tasting or gritty.

Fortification of syrup with calcium is advantageous. Syrup is consumed with milk or ice cream. Research shows that the Vitamin D in milk greatly aids the bioavailability and absorption of calcium in the body. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to have synergistic absorption of calcium from a syrup consumed together with a dairy product.

Other objects, features, advantages of the invention shall become apparent as the description thereof proceeds when considered in connection with the accompanying examples.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to powered toothbrushes, and more particularly, to a toothbrush having a head with two distinct moving sections with each section providing oral health benefits to the user.

2. Discussion of Related Art

Toothbrushes provide many oral hygiene benefits. For example, toothbrushes remove plaque and food debris to help avoid tooth decay and disease. They remove stained pellicle from the surface of each tooth to help whiten the teeth. Also, the bristles combined with the brushing motion massage the gingival tissue for stimulation and increased health of the tissue.

Powered toothbrushes have been available for some time. Powered toothbrushes have advantages over manual (non-powered) toothbrushes in that they impart movement to the bristles at much higher speeds than possible manually. They also may impart different types and directions of motion. These motions, generally in combination with manual movement of the toothbrush by the user, provide superior cleaning than manual toothbrushes. Typically, powered toothbrushes are powered by disposable or rechargeable batteries that power an electric motor that in turn drives the toothbrush head.

Known powered toothbrushes include a brush head with a bristle carrier portion that rotates, oscillates or vibrates in some manner so as to clean the teeth. The bristles, which typically comprise bristle tufts, are generally uniform with one end fixed into the bristle carrier portion and the other end free to contact the surface of the teeth while brushing. The free ends of the various tufts present a surface envelope that is capable of some deformation when the bristles bend. When in contact with the surface to be brushed, the bristles may deform so that the surface envelope tends to conform to the complex surface of the teeth. Human teeth generally lie in a “C” shaped curve within the upper and lower jaws, and each row of teeth consequently has a convex outer curve and a concave inner curve. Individual teeth often have extremely complex surfaces, with areas that may be flat, concave, or convex. The more precise conformation between the bristles and the tooth surface, the more effective the toothbrush may be in cleaning, whitening and/or stimulating.

Known powered toothbrushes typically arrange the bristles in a compact conical or cylindrical pattern on a generally circular, disk-shaped bristle carrier. The powered toothbrush heads are traditionally compact, generally oval in shape and the heads are produced with a flat trimmed bristle pattern. Alternatively, other head shapes and bristle patterns are available.

One example of a powered toothbrush is depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 to McDougall, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The toothbrush shown in McDougall has a disc-shaped bristle carrier. The bristle carrier, and thus the bristles, are driven in a vibrating or oscillating manner. This type of toothbrush is described herein with reference toFIGS. 1A-1C. A toothbrush5includes a handle portion10at a proximal end of the toothbrush5and a head11at a distal end of toothbrush5. Handle portion10has compartments for containing a powered motor14and batteries15and16. Head11includes a generally circular bristle holder (carrier)13. A rotatable shaft12extends from motor14to head11. A shaft coupling17may be located along shaft12and configured to provide for shaft12to be separated at a point between motor14and head11. This permits the shaft to be removed from toothbrush5, e.g. for cleaning, servicing, or replacement.

Head11includes a post18that provides a rotational pivot axis for bristle holder13containing bristle tufts19. The distal end of shaft12has a journal or offset20that is radially displaced from the longitudinal axis of shaft12, which may be integrally formed therewith. Bristle holder13has a slot22that receives offset20. Offset20and slot22are configured so as to be oriented toward the intersection of shaft12axis and the longitudinal axis of post18. When motor14rotates shaft12, the motion of offset20defines a circle about shaft12axis and drivingly engages slot22such that bristle holder13vibrates or oscillates about post18axis through a rotational angle A. The rotational angle A is defined by the displacement of offset20from shaft12axis relative to the diameter of bristle holder13.

Although powered toothbrushes such as those described immediately above provide advantages over manual toothbrushes, they are subject to various limitations. Providing a rotating or oscillating bristle holder (carrier) with a typical oblong or oval toothbrush head constrains the size of the moving bristle holder, and consequently the area of bristles available for teeth cleaning. Also, when the bristles are placed in contact with the teeth during brushing, there is less bristle contact with adjacent areas, such as the gums. Thus, while these compact bristle patterns provide for cleaning, there is minimal whitening and stimulation.

One attempt to overcome the limitations associated with a small powered bristle area is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,000,083 to Blaustein et al. The toothbrush in Blaustein et al. has a bristle area and pattern similar to a manual toothbrush, but an area of the bristles has simply been replaced by a powered bristle section. The result is that the head has a powered or moving bristle section and static bristle section. The limitation of Blaustein et al. is that the static bristle section provides no better cleaning, whitening or stimulation than a manual toothbrush.

International Application No. PCT/EP01/07615 of Braun GmbH discloses a powered toothbrush with two separate bristle parts that can move. Each bristle part can have a different range and/or type of motion. However, only one bristle part is powered. The other unpowered bristle part moves due to a resonance effect imparted by the frequency of the movement of the first bristle part.

This free resonance causes a number of difficulties. First, because any contact between the bristle parts will dampen or cancel any resonance of the unpowered bristle part, the unpowered bristle part “floats” separately from the powered bristle part. This necessitates separation or gaps between them. These gaps expose the internal workings of the head to foreign matter such as water, saliva, toothpaste, and food particles. This foreign matter may interfere with the workings of the unpowered bristle head. For example, the unpowered bristle part is spring-loaded to assist its resonance. Foreign matter may accumulate on or around the spring, interfering with its function. In addition, food particles may remain in the head and may fester and host microorganisms, which are undesirable if not potentially harmful when introduced directly into the mouth.

Another limitation of such a design is that movement of the unpowered bristle part may be damped by contact with the teeth, or lessened when the frequency of the powered part shifts from the resonance frequency. This can occur due to pressure imparted against the powered bristle part by the teeth or gums during brushing. Finally, the energy imparted to the unpowered bristle part is only a portion of the energy input into the powered part. Therefore, the unpowered bristle part is less effective in cleaning than the powered part, limiting the overall effectiveness of the toothbrush.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a powered toothbrush with increased effectiveness through a larger area of powered or driven bristles or bristles that are otherwise movable. There is also a need for a toothbrush having increased whitening and/or stimulation than known toothbrushes. There is further a need for such improved toothbrushes to be comparable in manufacturing and purchasing costs as known powered toothbrushes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A powered toothbrush is provided and includes a handle portion at a proximal end and a head at a distal end with a neck being formed between the handle portion and the head. According to one embodiment, the head has two distinct movable parts that provide oral health benefits since each part is adapted to have a number of bristles or elastomeric cleaning members or a combination thereof extending therefrom to contact surfaces of the teeth and surrounding areas. The toothbrush has a drive mechanism that imparts movement to one of the movable parts to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening action that supplements the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush.

In one exemplary embodiment, the first movable head part is a first bristle carrier that supports a number of bristle tufts, elastomeric cleaning members, or a combination thereof. The first bristle carrier is operatively mounted to the head and is coupled to the drive mechanism such that the first bristle carrier oscillates back and forth in a direction about a center point of the first bristle carrier. Preferably, the oscillating first bristle carrier is moved back and forth in a rotational direction. The second movable part is a second bristle carrier in the form of an elastomeric “shock-absorbing” member that is operatively mounted to the head and includes a number of bristle tufts, elastomeric cleaning members, or combination thereof, extending outwardly therefrom. During a brushing action, forces are applied against the second carrier and the elastomeric nature of the second bristle carrier causes the earner to move in a substantially up and down manner to deliver additional oral health benefits including enhanced cleaning, tooth polishing and/or tooth whitening.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the foregoing detailed description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

The invention accordingly comprises the several steps and the relation of one or more of such steps with respect to each of the others, and the apparatus embodying features of construction, combination(s) of elements and arrangement of parts that are adapted to effect such steps, all as exemplified in the following detailed disclosure, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached. The cleaning elements of these toothbrushes are configured for cleaning and/or for polishing a user's teeth, but are not configured for effective cleaning of soft tissue in a user's mouth, such as the user's tongue.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a soft tissue cleanser with a ring of projections for dislodging microbial and other debris from soft tissue of a user's mouth. The ring of projections may include nubs and ridges for engaging the soft tissue. The ring may border a central portion on a face of the oral care implement, which may have a depth in comparison with the height of the projections.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleanser in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof. These and other aspects are discussed in relation to the following figures.

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

SUMMARY

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a vibrating toothbrush generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush having vibrations that are isolated in the head and having reduced transmissions to the handle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Power toothbrushes generally comprise a power source, a motor and a powered element that is driven by the motor. In one type of power toothbrush, a power toothbrush head is provided with movable cleaning elements that are usually driven laterally, rotationally or in an oscillating manner by a motor located in the handle. The motor generates a vibration that is absorbed directly by the hands of the user. However, such vibration is effectively a byproduct of the motor operation and is usually not intended to enhance the effectiveness of the movable cleaning elements. Instead, the vibration provides a tactile sensation to the user and generally creates a perceived feeling of increased cleaning effectiveness.

Another type of power toothbrush relies primarily on vibrations to produce a cleaning operation. These are normally referred to as “sonic”-type brushes because the vibrations generated to achieve a high cleaning efficacy are generally of a frequency of 20-20,000 Hz that can be perceived by the human ear as a “buzz.” However, the combination of this sonic noise and the high-frequency vibration felt on one's teeth create a tactile sensation of highly increased effectiveness. To achieve the greatest cleaning, it is preferable to situate the vibration-generation device as close to the toothbrush head as possible so as to focus the vibratory energy near the site of greatest cleaning, and not along the handle.

In some prior art sonic-type brushes, elastomeric regions are provided between the motor and the handle to dampen the vibrations felt in the handle. However, such regions tend to decrease the structural strength of the neck and create localized weaknesses in the neck material that could subject the toothbrush to breakage or cause the toothbrush to fail cyclic fatigue tests. Dampening regions are also noticed in other vibrating-type toothbrushes near the junction of the neck and the handle, usually in the form of an elastomeric section or sections of varying configurations. However, again, such sections create structural weaknesses at a location that usually receives a significant amount of stress during use.

There is a need, therefore, to provide a vibration-powered toothbrush having cleaning vibrations that are directed toward or isolated in the head region and reduced in the handle region, and that do not create weakened areas that subject the toothbrush to breakage and cyclic fatigue.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A vibrating toothbrush is provided with vibration-isolating zones that substantially isolate vibrations in the head and reduce vibrations transmitted to the handle, without sacrificing structural integrity. Such vibration-isolating zones may generally comprise neck material that is reduced in cross-section, thinned, replaced by elastic or dampening material, or removed altogether to create transmission-inhibiting voids. Such zones may be further supported by the housing of the vibratory element to maintain the structural integrity around the zones.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of art is available that describes various zirconium-aluminum-glycine salts and methods of making them. In a typical aluminum zirconium glycine (abbreviated herein as “ZAG”, “ZAG complexes” or “AZG”) antiperspirant active species, the zirconium species enhances the efficacy because of its higher charge/size ratio resulting in its tendency to undergo rapid hydrolysis. The efficacy of ZAG is mainly dependent on the zirconium size distribution; i.e., uniform and smaller zirconium species will significantly enhance efficacy because of zirconium's strong tendency to hydrolyze even at a lower pH range, (pH of greater than 0 to 3). Glycine as a gelation inhibitor has been extensively employed in antiperspirant salts to prevent the zirconium (Zr) from further gelling or precipitating, thereby enhancing efficacy. It has been clinically shown that, in general, the smaller the species, the higher the efficacy on sweat reduction.

A number of efforts have focused on (1) how to select the components of ZAG which affect the performance of these materials as antiperspirants and deodorants and (2) how to manipulate these components to obtain and maintain the presence of smaller types of these components. In this regard, however, no pure phase of Zirconium-Glycine salt (abbreviated herein as “ZG”) has been isolated and reported.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention overcomes the problems and disadvantages associated with current antiperspirant active species (ZAG) that hydrolyze rapidly by providing a synthetic route of producing mall and stabilized oxo-hexameric zirconium-octaamino acid species, such as zirconium-glycine (ZG), with a greatly reduced tendency of forming higher molecular weight zirconium complexes.

The invention is based in part on the finding that the smallest oxo-hexameric zirconium-octaamino acid salt provides improved stability and efficacy of zirconium-amino acid species for formulations in antiperspirant and/or deodorant compositions to improve efficacy and to extend shelf life.

In one embodiment, the invention includes a process for preparing an oxo-hexameric zirconium-octaamino acid salt, the process includes:a) mixing zirconium (Zr):amino acid:and mineral acid (MA) in a molar ratio of 1:about 1 to about 15:about 1.5 to about 3 to form a mixture;b) optionally, filtering the mixture; andc) optionally, drying the mixture.

In another embodiment, the oxo-hexameric zirconium-octaamino acid salt has a molecular formula: oxo-[Zr6AminoAcid8].Xy.nH2O, wherein “Zr” is zirconium, “X” is an anion of a mineral acid, and wherein n and y are numerical values from 0 to 20.

In another embodiment, the oxo-hexameric zirconium-octaglycine cluster cation has a structure as shown inFIGS. 1A and 1B.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a powered toothbrush having a head with a plurality of movably mounted bristle sections.

2. Description of the Related Art

Various types of powered toothbrushes are generally known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 discloses an electrically driven toothbrush having a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft connects to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 shows a further type of powered toothbrush wherein the head includes a pair of concentrically arranged sections, each of which is driven in a rotationally oscillating manner in opposite directions. The toothbrush head includes the two counter-oscillating sections, but does not include any other sections onto which bristles may be mounted.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,313 discloses a household appliance such as a toothbrush that may be used for cleaning, polishing, or massaging. The head of the appliance includes a plurality of co-axially rotatable or parallel linearly-movable sections, but fails to provide other bristle-containing sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567 discloses an electrically-driven toothbrush that includes a rotatable brush head having bristles thereon. A further group of bristles, each of which rotates around its own axis, reside adjacent to the brush head. U.S. Pat. No. 1,796,641 relates to a spotting brush for dry-cleaning that includes a pair of rotatably mounted side-by-side heads.

None of the powered toothbrushes of the related art includes two separate, movable bristle sections or tuft blocks. Thus, there is a need in the art for a powered toothbrush having more than one movable bristle section or tuft block to enhance the cleaning efficiency of the toothbrush.

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION

It is a general object of the present invention to provide a powered toothbrush which avoids the aforementioned deficiencies of the known prior art.

It is also an object of the present invention to provide a powered toothbrush which enhances the cleaning efficiency of the toothbrush head.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide a powered toothbrush which includes two separate, movable bristle sections or tuft blocks.

It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a powered toothbrush which includes a rotationally oscillating section and a linearly oscillating section both of which have bristles for delivery of a cleaning, polishing, and whitening action.

It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a powered toothbrush which is similar in appearance to a manual toothbrush.

Various other objects, advantages and features of the present invention will become readily apparent from the ensuing detailed description and the novel features will be particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves the problems of the related art by providing a powered toothbrush which includes a rotationally oscillating section, a linearly oscillating section, and, optionally, a stationary section, all of which have bristles for delivery of a cleaning, polishing, whitening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush.

As embodied and described herein, the present invention is broadly drawn to a powered toothbrush having a handle with a neck, and a head removably connected to the neck and having an exposed outer surface. A first tuft block is mounted to the head and includes a first array of bristles extending outwardly from the exposed outer surface of the head. A first drive member is operatively connected to the first tuft block for moving the first tuft block about an axis generally perpendicular to the exposed outer surface. A second tuft block is mounted to the head and includes a second array of bristles extending outwardly from the exposed outer surface of the head. A second drive member is operatively connected to the second tuft block for moving the second tuft block in a direction generally perpendicular to the exposed outer surface of the head.

In various embodiments of the present invention, the second tuft block oscillates back and forth in a direction perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head or in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. In yet an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the second tuft block is capable of oscillating in and out in a direction perpendicular to the outer surface of the toothbrush head to form a vibrating section.

In still another aspect of the present invention, a third stationary tuft block having a third array of bristles may be provided below the second tuft block towards the handle of the toothbrush.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

Bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, but have generally been inadequate in respect to their effectiveness and/or safety. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of nubs for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth and particularly for cleaning between the papillae of the tongue. In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of conically shaped nubs.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser is constructed from an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleanser is formed as an elastomeric pad mounted on the head of the oral care implement for improved cleaning, ease of manufacture, and user comfort.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes at least one projection that protrudes from a base of material extending along the head of the implement. In one embodiment, a plurality of projections extend along the head in a spaced apart relationship along a pad formed as an elongate strip that is fixed to the head. In one construction, the base overlies a generally rigid head structure. Alternatively, the base is integrally formed as part of the head thereby forming a flexible head.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of at least one elongate ridge and a plurality of nubs or other discrete projections having a non-elongate structure. As a result, the tongue and other soft tissue of the mouth are cleaned with the benefit of both kinds of cleanser projections for an enhanced cleaning effect.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of hard and soft projections to clean the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth. In one construction, the cleanser includes a plurality of soft nubs and at least one elongate ridge of hard material. In this way, the combined benefits of a soft and hard cleanser can be gained in one implement.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes at least one projection with a scraping edge to be moved over the tongue or other tissue. The edge is formed by sloped surfaces having different inclinations. In one construction, a steeper slope faces generally toward the handle to provide a more aggressive scraping action as the head is dragged out of the mouth. The shallower surface makes the projection less prone to pushing tongue biofilm farther back in the throat.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a seat to facilitate and ease molding of the tissue cleanser to the head. In one preferred construction, the head has one or more protuberances for anchoring the head during molding of the tissue cleanser. The head may also include a basin to further define the outline of the molded tissue cleanser.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement includes a tissue cleanser having means for reducing oral volatile sulfur compounds by 35% from a baseline measured two hours after use.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser for a thorough cleaning of the teeth, gums, tongue and oral surfaces of the cheeks and lips. In a preferred construction, the tooth cleaning elements and tissue cleanser are supported on opposite sides of a supporting head.

In one other aspect of the invention, an oral care implement which includes tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser forms at least one of the tooth cleaning elements as a unitary member with the tissue cleanser.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to plaque removal and whitening capabilities for toothbrushes and toothpastes, and, more particularly to a computer-implemented system and method for automatically evaluating the efficacy of plaque removal and whitening capabilities for different toothbrushes and toothpastes.

B. Description of the Related Art

Gum (or periodontal) disease, including dental plaque, is problematic in American and European households. Almost seventy-five percent of Americans and Europeans suffer from gum disease and plaque to some extent. While removal of plaque using dental cleaning devices is an effective method for plaque control, such removal techniques require frequent visits to the dentists which are time-consuming and expensive. Brushing one's teeth is one of the most economical and time-effective method of plaque control. However, negligible work has been done on the analysis of the efficaciousness of tooth brushing methods to maintain gingival health. While the toothbrush features that control plaque removal, such as, e.g., handle size, head size, bristle configurations, bristle patterns, etc. are well-known, no work has been done to date on the efficacy of brush design for plaque removal on a tooth-by-tooth basis.

Recently, a system to determine plaque removal efficacy was implemented. The system measured the plaque on teeth as disclosed by the fluorescence of the teeth under ultraviolet (“UV”) light. UV light makes plaque on teeth fluoresce as a yellow color, enamel as a light blue color, gum as a black color, and plaque on gum as a green color. In the system a set of each patient's front teeth was visually and manually overlaid with a synthetic template set for alignment, and then a digital image of the manually-aligned teeth was obtained. A simple Mahalanobis-distance based classifier was used to classify each pixel as plaque or enamel. The Mahalanobis distance is a very useful algorithm for determining the similarity of a set of values from an unknown sample to a set of values measured from a collection of known samples. The ratio of plaque versus enamel yielded a measure of percentage plaque on each patient for all the teeth combined. Resultant analyses before and after brushing allowed a measure of the efficacy of plaque removal for each toothbrush.

This system suffers from several drawbacks. First, it does not measure plaque removal efficacy for each tooth, and does not consider plaque measurements from teeth inside the mouth or on the inner (i.e., lingual) tooth surface. This is a significant disadvantage since some toothbrushes could remove plaque from teeth at the front of the mouth, but not remove plaque from the teeth in the interior of the mouth due to insufficient reach. Second, the alignment procedure of the system is visually performed and inconsistent since individual teeth vary widely from the synthetic set used in the system.

Recently, a robot-based brushing system was introduced to test plaque removal on synthetic teeth (“typodonts”). Synthetic plaque was coated onto the typodonts and different brush heads were used to brush the synthetic teeth using the robot-based brushing system. A simple image processing system was used to measure the plaque remaining after brushing. The image processing task was simple because the plaque on teeth could be easily distinguished from enamel and gum using the RGB values. Though this system is consistent since the brushing action does not vary much, the use of synthetic plaque is not realistic and does not reflect the presence of plaque on real teeth accurately. Nor does the system accurately reflect brushing actions in the mouth where the hard-to-reach teeth typically get brushed less than the front teeth

Thus there is a need in the art for an automated system for analyzing plaque and whitening on a tooth-by-tooth basis in real-time to assist in the determination of the usefulness of new toothbrushes and toothpastes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention satisfies this need by providing a computer-implemented system and method for automatically evaluating the efficacy of plaque removal and whitening capabilities for different toothbrushes and toothpastes. The system and associated algorithms allow plaque analysis on a tooth-by-tooth basis in real-time, thereby facilitating clinical evaluation of the effectiveness of different model toothbrush designs for plaque-removal efficacy for each individual tooth and sub-regions within each tooth, prior to mass-manufacture of the toothbrush.

Additional advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be learned from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations, and equivalents thereof, particularly pointed out in the appended claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

This invention relates to laundry detergent compositions having a high water soluble alkaline carbonate (soda ash) builder content.

Laundry detergent compositions comprising a water-soluble alkaline carbonate are well-known in the art. For example, it is conventional to use such a carbonate as a builder in detergent compositions which supplement and enhance the cleaning effect of an active surfactant present in the composition. Such builders improve the cleaning power of the detergent composition, for instance, by the sequestration or precipitation of hardness causing metal ions such as calcium, peptization of soil agglomerates, reduction of the critical micelle concentration, and neutralization of acid soil, as well as by enhancing various properties of the active detergent, such as its stabilization of solid soil suspensions, solubilization of water-insoluble materials, emulsification of soil particles, and foaming and sudsing characteristics. Other mechanisms by which builders improve the cleaning power of detergent compositions are probably present but are less well understood. Builders are important not only for their effect in improving the cleaning ability of active surfactants in detergent compositions, but also because they allow for a reduction in the amount of the surfactant used in the composition, the surfactant being generally much more costly than the builder.

Sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) and/or potassium carbonate (K2CO3) are the most common carbonates included in laundry detergents to impart increased alkalinity to wash loads, thereby improving detergency against many types of soils. In particular, soils having acidic components e.g. sebum and other fatty acid soils, respond especially well to increased alkalinity.

While laundry detergents containing a relatively large amount of carbonate builder are generally quite satisfactory in their cleaning ability, the use of such carbonate builders often results in the problem of calcium carbonate precipitation, which may give rise to fabric encrustation due to the deposition of the calcium carbonate on the fiber surfaces of fabrics which in turn causes fabric to have a stiff hand and gives colored fabrics a faded appearance. Thus, any change in available carbonate built laundry detergent compositions which reduces their tendency to cause fabric encrustation is highly desirable.

In many applications, it is desirable to include Na2CO3and K2CO3in detergent formulations at levels greater than 20%. This is readily achieved in the case of a powdered detergent. However, incorporating such large amounts into an aqueous liquid is much more difficult. In liquid laundry detergent compositions, the incorporation of a large amount of detergent builder poses a significant formulation challenge since the presence of a major quantity of detergent builder inevitably causes the detergent composition to phase separate. Liquid detergent formulations that contain a detergent builder ingredient require careful control of the surfactant to builder ratio so as to prevent salting-out of the surfactant phase. Liquid laundry detergent compositions are also susceptible to instability under extended freeze/thaw and high/low temperature conditions.

Additionally, sodium carbonate forms an extensive array of low water soluble hydrates at low temperatures and high, i.e., >15 wt. % levels of the sodium carbonate builder. For example, a system with 20% carbonate builder will form a decahydrate phase below 23° C. At 30% sodium carbonate, the decahydrate will form below 31° C. Therefore, even at room temperature, systems containing greater than 20% carbonate builder are inherently unstable and readily form decahydrate phases. Once the decahydrate forms, redissolution can take an inordinate amount of time.

Accordingly, there is still a desire and a need to provide a stable liquid laundry detergent which has a high ash content.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, a stable aqueous-based liquid laundry detergent is provided with an ash content of greater than 15 wt. % by incorporating a hygroscopic agent therein in sufficient amounts to prevent excessive insoluble hydrate formation. One or more surfactants including anionic, non-ionic and amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants can be added. Stability of the liquid composition is further provided by adjusting the ratio of anionic surfactant to zwitterionic surfactant contained in the composition.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, and more particularly, to a powered toothbrush configured for ease of use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Powered toothbrushes generally have a movable head that is motor-driven from a handle. While such toothbrushes usually achieve a more intensive cleaning action than manual toothbrushes, they may be uncomfortable for users due to transmission of motor vibrations to the hand of the user.

These problems are magnified in that adult powered toothbrushes may be uncomfortable for some users, such as children. In particular, the anatomical structure of children generally provides insufficient musculoskeletal strength or control of the hands or fingers to effectively manipulate adult electric toothbrushes. Further, the differences in the oral cavity size and tooth configurations between children and adults make it difficult for children to use adult toothbrushes. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement ergonomically configured for children.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

There is provided an ergonomic toothbrush for the anatomical structures of children.

In one embodiment, a resilient sleeve covers at least a portion of a toothbrush handle to provide comfort for the user. In other embodiments, a resilient sleeve has three-dimensional sculpture shapes or two dimensional graphics to provide a visually appealing product with reduced vibration transmission to a user's hand.

In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes user replaceable sections or covers enabling selective tailoring of the visual appearance. In yet another embodiment, a toothbrush is configured for exposure of products by providing regions for placement of advertising or other promotional material. In one embodiment, a toothbrush has three dimensional sections in visually appealing or recognizable shapes for promoting more frequent brushing by children. Other embodiments include other features as a way of enticing children to become interested in the toothbrush and brushing in general.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to new beverage products made from steeping cocoa with water. The beverages can be produced as a ready-to-drink product, a concentrate, or as a mix or packet for steeping cocoa to produce a beverage. In advantageous embodiments, the beverages can be produced as a tea-type drink and may optionally contain healthy ingredients in addition to the beneficial cocoa antioxidants. In other advantageous aspects, the methods permit effective filtering and processing of a cocoa/water mixture as well as options to reduce or substantially reduce the appearance of a surface fat ring, or cocoa fat ring, commonly present in the beverage containers of fat-containing compositions upon storage.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

A variety of cocoa beverages have been available. Almost exclusively, however, these products employ a milk or liquor base to dissolve the cocoa or maintain the cocoa in solution. Immediate examples include chocolate milk and cocoa liquors. However, as more and more evidence shows the benefit of cocoa antioxidants or cocoa polyphenol compounds, a variety of food products with these compounds are desirable. The invention, in one aspect, addresses this desire by combining conventional tea steeping processes with cocoa polyphenol-containing products or extracts to produce a refreshing cocoa beverage. In another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of filtering a mixture of a cocoa product and water or aqueous solution, as prior methods were prone to clogging and inefficiencies that prevent commercial production.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to beverages made from steeped cocoa, such as cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa powder, or other cacao bean compositions. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a method for producing a refreshing beverage containing cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, and which in certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or is a low calorie beverage. The beverage can be sealed in a container for commercial distribution and be capable of stable storage for more than one month at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. A variety of filtering, irradiating, heating, centrifugation, or treatment methods, or a combination of these, can be used to produce a beverage capable of stable storage over a period of time. Other similar or compatible methods known or available in the art can also be used.

The method for producing the beverage can include the use of purified or sterilized water at certain temperatures, or a number of desired temperatures or ranges in temperature. However, any potable water or even flavored water can be used. Filtering or purifying methods to remove insoluble components, or most of or substantially all of the insoluble components can be used, as known in the art. Preferred water includes carbon filtered water, deionized water and/or water purified by reverse osmosis. In addition, aqueous solutions can be used, such as buffered aqueous solutions of citric acid, more preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% citric acid, or about 0.4% to about 0.7%, or about 0.6% citric acid at about pH 4 or below, or between about pH 3 to about pH 4. An aqueous solution prepared from water previously mixed with cocoa nibs can also be used. The use of this cocoa nib-treated water can provide additional cocoa flavoring, and the cocoa nib-treated water can also be free of fat and/or substantially free of calories. After steeping the water or aqueous solution with the cocoa product, the water is treated or filtered or purified to produce a ready-to-drink beverage or a cocoa water composition. The cocoa water composition or beverage can optionally be concentrated by methods known in the art, and then used by adding water and optionally sweeteners and/or flavorings to produce a ready-to-drink product.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. In a similar aspect, the invention includes methods to produce a cocoa water composition, and the compositions themselves, whereby the propensity to form a fat ring on a storage container of the cocoa water or a final product is substantially reduced or minimized. In particular, the invention includes the use of acidifying conditions or low pH buffering additives, such as citric acid, lactic acid and/or phosphoric acid compounds or combinations, used at one or more steps in the production process. Preferably, a pH of about 3.5 or below can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring on the container after storage. Filtration steps, filter aids, centrifugation steps, and settling time, all at selected or different temperatures, can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring. Additionally, the use of low fat cocoa powder, with about 1.2% fat, can reduce the appearance of a fat ring. In general, low fat cocoa powder contains lees than 10% cocoa butter, and defatted cocoa powder contains less than 2% cocoa butter. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The products and the methods of the invention can, in any embodiment, also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Beverage emulsifiers, beverage stabilizers, weighting agents, thickeners can also be added, and a preferred group is polysorbates, carrageenans, Tween 60, Tween 80, and gum arabic. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

In another aspect, the invention comprises packets for steeping cocoa extracts or products to produce a cocoa beverage. The packets can be similar to tea bags and can be submerged in water for steeping, as desired. Thus, certain embodiments of the invention can be made into individualized packets produced and sized to accommodate a mix or composition for producing a beverage when placed in water or other liquid. A number of other consumable products and mixes can be devised by one of ordinary skill in the art.

Preferably, the methods and products use natural cocoa or extracts that are not treated with alkaline, a process also known as “Dutching.” However, as noted, a variety of cocoa powders, cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa compositions, and cacao bean compositions are known and available to one of skill in the art and can be selected for use in any aspect of the invention. In addition, extracts with enhanced levels of cocoa polyphenols or cocoa flavanols, or extracts with additives, can also be selected for use. Furthermore, combinations of cocoa powders, extracts, enhanced extracts, concentrates, extracts with additives can be selected and used for any aspect of the invention. The terms “cocoa extract” and “cocoa bean composition” for steeping, thus, can be any of a variety of products and combinations as well as specific combinations of the cacao bean-derived products noted in this disclosure.

In particularly preferred embodiments, the invention comprises beverages that contain efficacious cocoa-polyphenols and/or cocoa antioxidants. These beverages can be used in a healthy diet, for example a diet to improve cardiovascular conditions or prevent cardiovascular disease. Another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage composition that is a sugar-free and/or calorie-free cocoa beverage. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage that is sugar-free and/or calorie-free and optionally contains other available or known supplements, active ingredients, appetite suppressing agents, and similar agents or ingredients, especially those also found in antioxidant-containing foods, herbs, teas, coffees, or food product ingredients. Further, the beverage or packet composition may also or in addition be combined with one or more other dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc., to provide a nutritional or dietary supplement. Any of these combinations of the invention can advantageously provide benefits to human health and capture additional beneficial effects. Also, all of the ingredients or combinations may be combined with appropriate stabilizers, preservatives, binders, emulsifiers, weighting agents, and other edible or ingestible compounds known to one of skill in the art in the industry to produce a packet or beverage.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. The products and the methods of the invention can also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement having a head with two or more bristled faces.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristled section on a front face of the oral care implement followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums.FIG. 1schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush10, which has a head12and a handle14. As shown, the head has bristles16extending from a front face of its head platform18. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

Some toothbrushes have a tongue cleaner on a second face that is opposite to the first face. This configuration permits the user to use a single device for cleaning their teeth as well as their tongue, by rotating the toothbrush as needed to change the active face.FIG. 2schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device30, which is generally the same as toothbrush10except that it includes a tongue cleaner20on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 2, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements that can provide multiple cleaning functions in a single device. Further, there is a need for alternative oral care implements that can simultaneously perform multiple functions during use while comfortably fitting within a user's mouth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter.

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a head with two or more bristled faces. Optionally, the oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements including bristles on a first face thereof and soft tissue cleaning elements including bristles on a second face thereof.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a head platform having a plurality of faces with bristles extending therefrom. In one configuration, the oral care implement has a pair of opposite bristled faces and the head platform has a thickness of 5 mm or less.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement having a plurality of faces with bristles extending therefrom is formed by affixing a first AFT-tufted carrier plate to a first face of a head platform and affixing a second AFT-tufted carrier plate to a second face of the head platform. In a further embodiment, an oral care implement having a plurality of faces with bristles extending therefrom is formed by in-mold tufting bristles in a first face and affixing an AFT-tufted carrier plate to a second face of the head platform.

These and other aspects of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to an oral care composition which contains a nonionic antibacterial compound effective in retarding bacterial plaque accumulation on teeth and more particularly to a dual component dentifrice composition containing an antibacterial compound in combination with an enzyme which achieves plaque reduction with superior breath freshening characteristics.

2. The Prior Art

Halitosis, the technical term for bad breath, or Fetor ex Oris, is an undesirable condition. As a matter of fact, everyone, excluding the very young, occasionally has bad breath, with approximately 25% suffering on a regular basis and the problem tends to get worse and more frequent as one gets older. The problem seems to be evenly split between men and women. Bad breath results when proteins from the food we eat and saliva debris are broken down by bacteria. Even the cleanest mouth hosts millions of bacteria which have the potential to decompose these protein-containing particles left in the mouth. The tongue, with its fissures and large, bumpy surface area, retains considerable quantities of food and debris that support and protect a large bacterial population. Under low oxygen condition, this bacterial population forms foul smelling products, called volatile sulfur compounds (VSC)—such as hydrogen sulfide (“rotten eggs”) and methyl mercaptans (“skunk smell”) and other odorous and bad tasting compounds. Up to 80-90% of bad breath that originates in the mouth is by this mechanism.

Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on teeth and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity, e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like. Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

Bacteria thrive on the tongue. For the most part, the bacteria are a part of a protective bio-film that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.

A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. For example, nonionic antibacterial compounds such as Triclosan are well known to the art for their antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity.

In spite of the extensive prior art relating to antibacterial dentifrice compositions, there is still a need in the art to formulate a dentifrice product capable of delivering an antibacterial agent effective in the retardation of bacterial plaque accumulation on teeth, as well as on the tongue, without inhibiting the bioavailability of the antibacterial compound. The delivery of the antibacterial compound to the tongue will allow for effective control of bad breath.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention encompasses a dual component dental composition which when applied to teeth contains a combination of a nonionic antibacterial compound, and an enzyme ingredient whereby reduction of plaque accompanied by a superior antimalodor benefit is accomplished during tooth brushing.

The present invention is based upon the discovery that when a separately maintained first nonionic antibacterial compound containing dental component and a second enzyme containing dentifrice component are simultaneously combined and thereafter applied to the surface of the teeth, undiminished antiplaque efficacy is unexpectedly obtained with a superior retardation of oral cavity malodor when the teeth are brushed with the combined components.

In one embodiment of the present invention, a dual component dentifrice composition of the present invention is provided being comprised of separate nonionic antibacterial compound and enzyme containing dentifrice components which are housed in a container wherein the components are maintained separate from each other and are not combined and admixed until simultaneous application to teeth is to be performed by the user as by brushing. Unexpectedly, when the separately maintained dental components are contacted with each other immediately prior to application to teeth, there is obtained undiminished antiplaque efficacy of the nonionic antibacterial compound accompanied by an enhanced antimalodor benefit.

The dual component dentifrice composition of the present invention was found to significantly reduce total bacteria on the tongue. Even more specifically, this dual component dentifrice combination was found to significantly reduce the level of bacterial species on the tongue surface responsible for the evolution of oral malodor up to five hours post brushing when compared to a clinically proven commercial toothpaste containing Triclosan.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

One of the complaints that consumers have regarding the brushing of teeth is the difficulty in washing away the residue of toothpaste and water left from a brushing and over time the ability to maintain a clean toothbrush. Part of the problem in washing away this residue is that the bristle carrier has been either a solid piece of plastic with blind holes or a solid piece of plastic in which bristles have either been embedded through a fusion process or through a molding process. In any case, it is quite likely that some of this residue will continue to reside on the bristle carrier around the bristles or bristle tufts as surface tension between the residue, and the material of the bristle carrier will cause residue to linger on the surface despite the user's best efforts.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,036 discloses a self-cleaning toothbrush wherein the head is provided with a series of intersecting support rails defining a grid pattern having the same thickness as the peripheral portion of the head. Open areas are created in the grid pattern which are overall greater than the corresponding bristle bunches to enhance the cleaning action when the head is placed under running tap water. The head including the grid pattern is of uniform thickness.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,870 shows a toothbrush with flexibly mounted bristles in a lattice or open network disposed against an otherwise imperforate base portion of the head. Thus, the head does not have through holes.

It would be desirable to provide a toothbrush which overcomes the problems relating to being able to maintain the toothbrush clean.

It would also be desirable if techniques could be used for effectively mounting the bristles to the carrier or head.

Various techniques have been disclosed in the prior art utilizing laser radiation and other techniques in the manufacture of toothbrushes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,592,594 and 4,762,373, for example, disclose rounding the bristle tips by the action of laser radiation. U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,143 discloses incorporating a laser device in the handle and a lens in the head as part of an optical system. Other patents disclosing various heat application techniques and related technology are U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,132,449, 4,390,384, 4,869,277, 4,979,782, 5,052,419, 5,390,984, 5,044,041, 5,143,425, 5,407,254, 5,472,263 and 5,673,454. In addition, reference is made to PCT/EP97/00825 (WO 97/30611), EP0124937 and EP0150785.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a toothbrush which minimizes problems relating to maintaining the toothbrush clean.

A further object of this invention is to provide techniques for mounting the bristles or other cleaning elements to the carrier or head of the toothbrush.

In accordance with this invention the head of the toothbrush includes a cleaning element carrier which is in the form of a peripheral frame having an open central area. The cleaning elements are secured to and extend outwardly from support members which are mounted to the frame at joints, such as slots or other openings in the frame. The support members extend across the open area of the frame in an open lattice type pattern having through holes over the open area to facilitate the cleaning of the toothbrush head.

The support members may be in the form of thin thermoplastic plates made from the same or similar material as the bristles. The bristles are secured to the plates by laser welding. This is accomplished by having a portion of the plate/bristle unit transparent to laser light wavelength while another portion is laser beam absorbing. The plates may then be secured at the joints on the frame in any suitable manner such as through a mechanical fit or through the use of various adhesives. A further manner of securement could be through welding including laser welding where the plates and frame are made of materials having similar melting temperatures.

In an alternative embodiment the support members could be base members made of the same material as the bristles such as a nylon material and could seat in arcuate openings at the joints on the frame when being stretched across the bristle carrier frame and thereby being attached on two sides.

In a preferred practice of this invention the cleaning elements are bristles which have their cleaning ends rounded.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a packaging device for condoms. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a condom card device which packages two condoms in separable wells.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are various contraceptives available today, but condoms are the most highly recommended prophylactic. The Surgeon General, various public health organizations, colleges and high schools recommend the use of condoms and even advocate free distribution to some degree as a remedy to the current spread of AIDS and venereal disease. However, there is some embarrassment associated with carrying condoms, especially if they fall out of one's wallet, pocket or purse at an inopportune time (as depicted on at least one episode of virtually every television sit-com in the last five years, or in the movie “Broadcast News” when purses had to be inspected by the Secret Service to gain entrance to an embassy party). There has been a long-felt need for a small, sealable pouch in which one or more foil-sealed condoms could be carried or stored to not only protect them against abrasion, but alleviate the anxiety that a condom might be evidenced under most embarrassing circumstances, thereby removing the reason that they are not handy when needed. Such pouch with one condom should be small enough to place in a wallet without adding much bulk, but flexible enough to contain multiple condoms for carrying or storing elsewhere. It should have a releasable, secure, flexible closure. While the primary utility of the pouch is to facilitate carrying condoms on the person, there has also been a long-felt need for such a product in which to store condoms in an automobile or a suitcase or discreetly within reach from one's bed.

Although substantially impermeable to air and moisture, the materials used to package individual condoms are generally thin and lightweight, and the packages must be adapted to be opened by the application of light-to-moderate manual force. Because of this fact, such packages are also susceptible to tearing or puncturing when placed in contact with other articles, such as might occur, for example, when individually packaged condoms are carried or maintained in a pocket, wallet, purse, glove compartment, desk drawer, or the like. Such tearing or puncturing may not be readily apparent to the user, but may be sufficient to permit contamination or degradation of the condom prior to use, or even failure of the condom during use at a subsequent time. One may also lose confidence in the reliability of a condom that has been carried for some time due to the worn or tattered appearance of the package in which it is wrapped, resulting in further anxiety and/or greater potential risk in the event of sexual contact.

The foregoing problems have deterred the effective utilization of condoms in the past, much to the detriment of the general public health. To obviate these problems, means are needed that can hold a single individually packaged condom, or a relatively small number of individually packaged condoms, that will protect the individually packaged condoms prior to use, and that will conceal individually packaged condoms to alleviate embarrassment to an individual carrying the condoms, or to a bystander.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a means for storing condoms that will protect and conceal the packaged condoms while they are carried on the person or stored by the consumer subsequent to purchase but prior to use. According to the present invention, the storage means, or condom card, comprises two separable half portions each containing a receptacle well for storing at least one condom therein. The at least one condom can be individually packaged in a foil, plastic or other similar wrap. The two separable halves are attached together by juxtaposed tabs and slots to form one single condom card.

The condom card also comprises a means of attaching or snapping the two separable half portions together. Any known means for attaching the two separable halves can be used, for example, juxtaposed tabs and slots can be used. In one embodiment, the condom card is covered with a seal or wrapper cover, e.g., a foil-seal or plastic covering, which is releasably secured over each of the receptacle well openings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention generally relates to ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-bypass protected biologically active content. More specifically in preferred embodiments this invention relates to feedstocks for domesticated ruminants which are capable of delivering undegraded essential aminoacids such as lysine and methionine to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants such as dairy cattle.

Publications cited in the present specification are incorporated by reference.

When a feedstock for ruminants has a content of biologically active constituent, a substantial amount of the said constituent (e.g., protein, aminoacids, and the like) is degraded to ammonia or carbon dioxide gas by microorganisms in the rumen. This prevents effective utilization of the administered biologically active constituent in the feedstock.

When special nutrients or medicaments are administered to ruminants, it is essential to protect these ingredients from decomposition in the rumen. The objective is to pass the said ingredients through the rumen to the omasum, and subsequently to the abomasum and absorption by the small intestine.

There are ongoing research and development activities which are seeking to achieve ruminant feedstock supplements which have the desired rumen-bypass properties. Rumen-bypass formulations are reported in numerous publications such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,842,863; 4,948,589; 5,023,091; 5,064,665; 5,093,128; 5,571,527; 5,633,004; 5,635,198; 6,203,829 and 6,306,427. There is further disclosure in WO2004/080197-A2 (PCT) and references cited therein.

Special effort has been directed to achieving rumen-bypass protection for essential aminoacids which supplement feedstocks for milk-producing ruminants.

It is known that lysine and methionine are important for milk production in dairy cattle. Journal of Dairy Science, 70, 789 (1987) reports that rumen-protected lysine increased feed intake, milk yield and 4% fat-corrected milk production in dairy cows. Rumen-protected methionine and lysine increased production of milk protein in dairy cows.

Similar results are reported in Journal of Dairy Science, 72, 1484 (1989); 72, 1800 (1989); 73, 135 (1990); and 74, 2997 (1991). Data also indicated that added fat increased the percentage and yield of long-chain fatty acids in cow milk. Adding ruminally-protected aminoacids to fat-supplemented diets appeared to alleviate the milk protein depression observed with added lipids in feedstock.

Because of the significant economic consequences of rumen-bypass undegraded dietary nutrient transport, there is continuing interest in the development of superior rumen-bypass feedstock supplements to promote these prospective advantages.

Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-protected biologically active content for advancing ruminant husbandry and for providing value added meat and dairy products for human consumption.

It is another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements to stabilize and maintain the health of ruminants, and to improve the lactational performances of dairy ruminants.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements which deliver post-rumen undegraded aminoacids in milk-producing dairy cattle for increased milk yield and increased production of milk protein.

It is a further object of this invention to provide an efficient process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement in compacted particulate form, which supplement has the capability of passing between about 40-96 percent of its rumen-protected biologically active content to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and example data.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an oral care implement and method of decorating the same, and more particularly to a method of applying a decorative cover to the body of an oral care implement such as a toothbrush handle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Kids' toothbrush handles are often fancifully decorated with colorful stickers having generic or licensed designs. Such designs are not only attractive and aesthetically pleasing, but usually drive the decision amongst a variety of brushes adorned with different designs.

It is known in the art to provide handle designs that are either two-dimensional or three-dimensional. The typical two-dimensional design is usually a decorative sticker or label of unlimited detail that is adhered or shrunk wrap to the handle and conforms to the shape of the handle. The production and application of the sticker adds an insignificant cost to the manufacture of the handle, as the sticker is manufactured separately and the application of such sticker usually requires a single manufacturing step. Such sticker or label provides a high level of flexibility for applying a complex decorative design to the handle of toothbrush. However, such decorative stickers or labels usually retain their two-dimensional character relative to a smooth, uncontoured or unsculpted handle.

Three-dimensional designs can take many forms. For example, some designs are molded and form part of the handle structure as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,202,242. In another example, an undecorated and uncontoured handle could be inserted into a preformed three-dimensional decorated sleeve as shown in U.S. Pat. No. D426,958, which sleeve could be manufactured in a more efficient manner separately from the toothbrush and solely contributes to the three-dimensional character of the handle. In the molded example, and possibly also the sleeve example, multiple paint operations applied to the three-dimensional feature are usually required to deliver an aesthetically pleasing, colorful design. Each paint operation delivers a particular color to a particular area of the design, which requires a separate manufacturing step at an incremental added cost. The more paint operations, the greater the cost.

Manufacturers that use licensed designs must often comply with certain aesthetic requirements imposed by the licensor. Such requirements may require a certain level of detail that can only be accomplished with a certain number of paint operations, for example. However, if the number of paint operations makes the design too expensive to manufacture, then the licensee must negotiate the use of a simpler design to the potential commercial detriment of both the licensor and the manufacturer. There is a need, therefore, for a way to provide a three-dimensional design that is aesthetically intricate and economical to manufacture.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An oral care implement is provided with a head and a body. The body is further provided with a three-dimensional surface feature that is generally undecorated. A generally two-dimensional cover is applied to at least a portion of the body that includes a decoration that is associated with the three-dimensional surface feature, preferably such that the body appears to have a decorated three-dimensional surface feature. A kit is disclosed that includes an oral care implement and a plurality of decorative covers to be applied to the oral care implement.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Various types of enzymes may be included in oral formulations to act as therapeutic agents. For example, enzymes may be included to hydrolyze oral polysaccharides or to inhibit bacterial growth. More specifically, for example, it was reported that enzymes such as mutanase, dextranase, papain, and 1,3-glucanase can be employed in oral formulations for removing plaque deposits.

Generally, enzymes by nature are vulnerable to changes of environment such as pH, temperature, and ion concentration, and thus it is usually necessary to take measures to protect enzymes to maintain intended oral-care efficacy of the enzymes. To improve performance of enzymes, enzyme-stabilizing agents, such as chelating agents and anti-oxidizing agents, have been suggested. Examples of such enzyme-stabilizing agents are EDTA, sodium gluconate, sodium bisulfite, metal gallates, sodium stannate, and ascorbic acid.

Among the enzyme-stabilizing agents, however, bisulfite materials, i.e., compounds containing bisulfite ion, are shown to be toxic to some individuals, and/or often alter the organoleptic properties of an oral care formulation. Therefore, it may be desirable to remove or reduce bisulfite materials in enzyme compositions before the compositions are further processed and delivered to consumers. Even though bisulfite materials can be removed through conventional techniques such as base extraction and neutralization by an oxidizing agent, these techniques often adversely affect the catalytic activity of enzymes in oral compositions. Thus, it is desirable to introduce an alternative method for removing bisulfite materials which does not negatively affect activity of enzymes in a composition to be treated. To date, there has been no convenient method to remove bisulfite materials from enzyme compositions, which method can be conducted under neutral, non-oxidizing conditions.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a method of removing bisulfite materials from a composition comprising bisulfite materials and one or more enzymes. The method comprises contacting the composition with a compound containing at least one aldehyde functional group to form an aldehyde-bisulfite complex; whereby the aldehyde-bisulfite complex may be separated from the composition.

In one embodiment, the method comprises contacting the composition with a compound containing at least one aldehyde functional group such as aldose sugar to form an aldehyde-bisulfite complex and separating the aldehyde-bisulfite complex from the composition, wherein the enzyme is selected from the group consisting of papain, bromelain, a serine protease, chymotrypsin ficin, glucose oxidase, galactose oxidase lactose peroxidase, lactoferrin, lysozyme, lipolytic enzymes, alcalase, a carbohydrase, a glucoamylasae, a dextranase, a mutase, a tannase, and a lipase.

In another embodiment, there is provided a method of removing bisulfite materials from a composition containing bisulfite materials and an enzyme, wherein the method comprises contacting the composition with a matrix having at least one aldehyde functional group to form an aldehyde-bisulfite complex and separating the matrix bound bisulfite from the composition.

In yet another embodiment, there is further provided an enzyme composition substantially devoid of bisulfite materials. The enzyme composition is obtainable by a method of contacting the composition with a compound containing at least one aldehyde functional group to form an aldehyde-bisulfite complex and then separating the aldehyde-bisulfite complex from the composition.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers are inadequate in respect to their effectiveness on the soft tissue surface of the tongue. Broad flat scraping blades are limited in their ability to reach between the papillae where the bacteria and microdebris have collected. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of nubs for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth and particularly for cleaning between the papillae of the tongue. In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of conically shaped nubs.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser is constructed from an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleanser is formed as an elastomeric pad mounted on the head of the oral care implement for improved cleaning, ease of manufacture, and user comfort.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a seat to facilitate and ease molding of the tissue cleanser to the head. In one preferred construction, the head has one or more protuberances for anchoring the head during molding of the tissue cleanser. The head may also include a basin to further define the outline of the molded tissue cleanser.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement includes a tissue cleanser having means for reducing oral volatile sulfur compounds by 35% from a baseline measured two hours after use.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser for a thorough cleaning of the teeth, gums, tongue and oral surfaces of the cheeks and lips. In a preferred construction, the tooth cleaning elements and tissue cleanser are supported on opposite sides of a supporting head.

In one other aspect of the invention, an oral care implement which includes tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser forms at least one of the tooth cleaning elements as a unitary member with the tissue cleanser.

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a toothbrush, either manual or powered, which includes a handle and a head. Cleaning elements are mounted to the head such as tufts of bristles. When toothpaste is applied to the cleaning elements the user inserts the head into the mouth and brushes the teeth in a known manner. Also included in this invention are prophylaxis polishing cups or arrays of bristles forming cups in the center of the head to hold toothpaste. These cups are closely surrounded by cleaning elements which help to retain the toothpaste within the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts, bundles or other groupings. The strands are attached to the head either before or after forming the toothbrush.

Various approaches have been advanced in the prior art for orientating the cleaning elements in the toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 2,083,217 issued Jun. 8, 1937 to E. I. Brothers, et al. discloses two or three circular brush sections which are arranged within cups5and5′ that may be screwed into mating receptacles in the tooth brush handle so that they can be removed and replaced as needed (page 2, lines 52-70). Each brush section contains stiff cleaning elements and is spaced from the other along the longitudinal axis of the handle at a distance less than the thickness of a tooth so that the brush operates on both the lingual (inside) and facial (outside) surfaces of the teeth (page 2, column 1, line 71 to column 2, line 9).

U.S. Pat. No. 5,604,951 describes a toothbrush with a head containing a flexible, rubber-like prophylaxis polishing cup or “prophy cup” similar to that used by dental personnel to professionally clean teeth. This prophy cup is loaded with toothpaste by the user and applied to the teeth. According to this patent, the “soft rubber-like prophy cup device follows the contours of teeth more effectively than bristles” (column 2, lines 23-26). This patent also discloses a ring of cleaning elements (“bristle tufts”) placed about the periphery of the toothbrush head which coact with the prophy cups to clean the user's teeth and gums (column 2, lines 34-47).

Another approach to oral hygiene is described in the toothbrush described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,041,468 issued to the assignee of this application. The cleaning elements (bristles) of this toothbrush are arranged in a concave shape across the width of the toothbrush head (SeeFIGS. 3-5and column 4, lines 1-22).

Design Patents illustrating circular groups of cleaning elements are U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 273,635 issued May 1, 1984 to Stocchi and D450,929S issued Nov. 27, 2001 to Angelina, et al.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention seeks to improve the tooth buffing/polishing capability of a toothbrush by inter alia providing a configuration that promotes retention of toothpaste in place within a toothbrush head while in use. This goal is achieved by mounting elastomeric prophy cups on a toothbrush head, which cups are closely surrounded by cleaning elements extending above the surface of the cups.

Unlike a professional dentist's office where the dental professional can repeatedly add toothpaste to a prophy cup, a typical domestic toothbrush user applies but one portion of toothpaste to a toothbrush. A substantial portion of the applied toothpaste, and thus its cleaning power, is typically lost after the first few movements of the toothbrush in the user's mouth. It either falls off as the top of the toothbrush head is tilted from horizontal to vertical as it approaches the mouth or is squeezed off as the toothbrush is pressed against the teeth. The toothpaste is of no cleaning value once it leaves contact with the brush and teeth.

Accordingly, this invention provides a unique combination of features to maintain and retain toothpaste on the head of a toothbrush. Prophy cup(s) are arranged in the center of the toothbrush head, preferably on the longitudinal axis of the head. Alternatively, the cups could be in the form of an array of bristles. These cups are closely surrounded by groupings of cleaning elements that have a greater height relative to the face of the toothbrush head than the height of the prophy cup from that face. This grouping of taller cleaning elements at least partially surrounds the prophy cup to form a barrier around the prophy cup that retains toothpaste when the toothbrush is in use.

An additional set of cleaning elements can then be arranged about the periphery of the toothbrush head to clean the teeth with the toothpaste retained by the prophy cup and surrounding cleaning elements. The outer set of cleaning elements also promotes massaging of the gum and removal of plaque at the gum line.

The cleaning elements are typically bristles secured to the toothbrush head by anchor free tufting (AFT) technology.

The invention may be practiced where each set of cup and surrounding cleaning elements is mounted on a disk and the disk is power driven to rotate continuously in the same direction or back and forth in an oscillating movement.

This invention is directed to a dispensing container that has an enhanced appearance. More particularly, this invention is directed to a dispensing container where the dip tube is formed into a decorative shape, which shape optionally coordinates with a design on the front or rear of the bottle.

BACKGROUND

Dispensing containers with dip tubes are used to store and dispense a range of personal care products. These include hand soaps, hand and body lotions, shampoos and body cleansing gels. There is a constant need to enhance the appearance of these containers. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,937,554, 6,073,373 and 6,233,856 the appearance is enhanced by a decorative film material placed within the container. A design on this decorative film material coordinates with a design on the front and/or rear surface of the container. This gives a 3-D appearance. U.S. Pat. No. 5,915,600 discloses attaching a figurine to the dip tube of a dispensing container. And U.S. Pat. No. 6,276,566 discloses a cylindrical section surrounding the dip tube and depending from the cap area of container, this cylindrical section having a decoration thereon. The objective in each of these patents is to enhance the appearance of the container and the product in the container.

The present invention improves on the techniques of these patents to enhance the appearance of a container and its product. In the present invention, the dip tube is molded to contain a multi-dimensional design. This technique simplifies the manufacture of dip tubes that have an attached identifiable shape since the dip tube and identifiable shape are made in a single operation. This is in distinction to where the dip tube and multi-dimensional shape are separately made and then assembled.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The invention comprises a dispensing container having a body portion and a neck portion. A pump dispenser is supported by the neck portion and comprises a pump mechanism with a dip tube at one end and an exit channel at another end. The dip tube has an identifiable three-dimensional shape as an integral part of the dip tube. A preferred mode of making the three dimensional identifiable shape is by blowmolding. The three-dimensional identifiable shape can be that of a land animal, a sea animal, an air animal or an inanimate object.

The identifiable shape preferably is decorated as to color by a label. This can be by in-mold labeling or by placing a shrink film label over the identifiable shape and heat shrinking the label to the identifiable shape. The colors of the label will be coordinated to the colors needed for the identifiable shape. In the use of in-mold labeling, the dip tube is shaped to have an identifiable shape and colored in a single operation. When a shrink film colored label is used, only two in-line steps are needed.

This identifiable shape on the dip tube will coordinate with a design on front and/or rear label. This coordination yields a three dimensional effect by a label design on the front or rear surface of the container and the identifiable shape.

It also is a preferred embodiment where the refractive index of the liquid in the container and that of the dip tube be within about 0.6 of each other, and preferably about 0.4 In this embodiment the dip tube substantially disappears in the liquid except for the identifiable shape of the dip tube.

The present invention relates to toothbrushes which include rotating sections in the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a powered toothbrush and in particular to a toothbrush head having movably mounted bristles. Various types of powered toothbrushes are generally known in the art. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 which relates to an electrically driven toothbrush having a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft is connected to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 shows a further type of powered toothbrush wherein the head includes a pair of concentrically arranged sections, each of which is driven in a rotational oscillating manner in opposite directions. The toothbrush head, however, includes only the two counter-oscillating sections. The head does not include any other sections on which bristles may be mounted.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,313 discloses a household appliance which would be used for cleaning, polishing or massaging. One such appliance is a toothbrush. The head has a plurality of co-axially rotatable or parallel linearly movable sections. No provision is made on the head for other bristle containing sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567 discloses an electrically driven toothbrush which includes a rotatable brush head having bristles thereon. Adjacent to the brush head are a further group of bristles each of which rotates around its own axis.

U.S. Pat. No. 1,796,641 relates to a spotting brush usable for dry-cleaning wherein a pair of side by side heads are rotatably mounted.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a powered toothbrush which includes counter-rotational or oscillating sections and a further section having bristles to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush.

In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head includes a first section or tuft block which is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction parallel to the outer surface of the toothbrush head. A second section or tuft block is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction also parallel to the toothbrush head, but in counter-oscillation to the direction of the first tuft block. A third section or tuft block is provided on the toothbrush head and also contains bristles.

In various practices of the invention the third section could be a fixed non-moving section wherein the bristles are also fixed. Alternatively, the bristles or the fixed section could be mounted movably in an elastomer material on the section to permit independent movement of such bristles, although the fixed section remains stationary.

In other practices of the invention the third section could be a movable section which oscillates back and forth in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head or in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. In yet another alternative practice of the invention the third section could oscillate in and out in a direction perpendicular to the outer surface of the toothbrush head to form a vibrating section which vibrating section may or may not simultaneously oscillate back and forth.

In a preferred practice of the invention the second tuft head is mounted within and concentric to the first tuft block. The bristles of the first tuft block may extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head a greater distance than the bristles of the second tuft head so as to create a cup-like shape which would facilitate retaining the toothpaste on the first and second tuft heads.

The third section is preferably mounted longitudinally in line with the first and second sections so that the portion of the head containing the bristles of the first, second and third sections is of an elongated shape which would also facilitate holding an elongated ribbon of toothpaste on the bristles.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a process for the production of ethanol by fermentation. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a process to improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The production of alcoholic beverages by the fermentation of fruit and grains is of ancient origin. In more recent times, the isolation of ethanol in concentrated or in pure form for use either in beverages, in industry, or as fuel, has assumed considerable importance. In general, ethanol may be produced by the fermentation of simple sugars such as glucose and fructose and oligosaccharides such as sucrose. Such substances and mixtures thereof which, without prior chemical modification, are convertible to ethanol will be referred to herein as “fermentable carbohydrates.” More complex carbohydrates such as starches and cellulosic materials also may be converted to ethanol by fermentation, but usually only after they are degraded to lower molecular weight sugars or related materials. The fermentation proceeds in an anaerobic environment, with production of carbon dioxide by-product. The Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., presents a condensed summary of the state of the art of producing and isolating fermentation-ethanol in Volume 9, at pages 352-361, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Ethanol has widespread application as an industrial chemical, gasoline additive or straight liquid fuel. As a fuel or fuel additive, ethanol dramatically reduces air emissions while improving engine performance. As a renewable fuel, ethanol reduces national dependence on finite and largely foreign fossil fuel sources while decreasing the net accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

In contrast to energy production by combustion of fossil fuels, energy production by combustion of contemporary biomass (predominantly in the form of harvested plant material) or fuels derived from such biomass is regarded as being “CO2-neutral”, since the amount of CO2released by combustion of a given amount of such biomass corresponds to the amount of CO2which was originally taken up from the atmosphere during the build-up of that amount of biomass.

Among fuels derived from plant biomass, ethanol has received particular attention as a potential replacement for or supplement to petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon products. To minimize the production cost of ethanol produced from biomass (also referred to in the following as “bioethanol”) it is important to use biomass in the form of low-cost by-products from gardening, agriculture, forestry, the timber industry and the like; thus, for example, materials such as straw, maize stems, forestry waste (log slash, bark, small branches, twigs and the like), sawdust and wood-chips are all materials which can be employed to produce bioethanol.

Biomass typically includes materials containing cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein and carbohydrates such as starch and sugar. Common forms of biomass include trees, shrubs and grasses, corn and corn husks as well as municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. Biomass high in starch, sugar or protein such as corn, grains, fruits and vegetables are usually consumed as food. Conversely, biomass high in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are not readily digestible and are primarily utilized for wood and paper products, fuel, or are disposed of.

Biomass contains two basic constituents, carbohydrates and lignin. The carbohydrate content of the biomass contains cellulose and hemicellulose. Both cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugars of glucose and xylose. Fermentation converts glucose and xylose to ethanol using enzymes produced by microorganisms, for example, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,210. Control of nutrients, pH, temperature, sugar concentration, and microorganism concentration all affect rate of fermentation to form ethanol. When ethanol concentration reaches above about 6 to 12%, ethanol concentration can be lethal to the microorganisms employed for fermentation. To reduce ethanol concentration within broth employed for fermentation and maintain activity of microorganisms, extraction of ethanol from the broth by solvents non-toxic to microorganisms, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,110,319, 4,865,973 and No. 4,517,298. The operations disclosed require energy for vaporization of ethanol and subsequent condensation to produce liquid ethanol.

The various operations in processes for obtaining ethanol from such recurring sources as cellulose, cane sugar, amylaceous grains and tubers, e.g., the separation of starch granules from non-carbohydrate plant matter and other extraneous substances, the acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and/or cellulose to fermentable sugar (saccharification), the fermentation of sugar to a dilute solution of ethanol and the recovery of anhydrous ethanol by distillation, have been modified in numerous ways to achieve improvements in product yield, production rates and so forth. For ethanol to realize its vast potential as a partial or total substitute for petroleum fuels or as a substitute chemical feedstock, it is necessary that the manufacturing process be as efficient in the use of energy and raw materials as possible so as to maximize the energy return for the amount of ethanol produced and enhance the standing of the ethanol as an economically viable replacement for petroleum-based chemicals. To date, however, relatively little concern has been given to the energy requirements for manufacturing ethanol from biomass and consequently, little effort has been made to minimize the thermal expenditure for carrying out any of the discrete operations involved in the manufacture of ethanol from vegetative sources.

There are three basic methods known for accelerating the fermentation rates of a sugar media to ethanol. These methods include 1) increasing the cell density, and/or 2) reducing the concentration of inhibitory compound(s) (with ethanol being most inhibitory due to its osmolality and toxic effects) in the media as suggested by Dale in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,027 and 5,141,861. The third method is to control the growth environment; such as with trace elements, vitamins, amino acid, pH, and temperature (Biology of Microorganisms, 7thedition, Brock, Madigan, Martinko and Parler. Prenitice Hall, Ney Jersey 1994). During a normal batch ethanol fermentation with standardS. cerevisaestrains, a final cell concentration of between 1.5 and 15 g/l cells is achieved. It is often noted that cell growth completely stops after a certain cell density is reached (Holzberg et al, 1967). The oxygen tension in the fermentation is important in these batch fermentations, as the cells will convert a larger fraction of the sugar substrate towards cell mass production as the amount of oxygen available to the cells increases. Trace oxygen can serve as a nutrient during the anaerobic fermentation of sugars, allowing more cell production that results in a greater fermentation rate of sugar to ethanol. Cysewski and Wilke (1978) show an optimal oxygen tension of about 0.1 mm O2. To maintain a cell density higher than the natural maximum attained in the fermenter, methods for keeping the cells in the fermenter must be utilized. A high cell density can be maintained either by recycling cells (through membrane or centrifugal techniques) or by retaining or immobilizing the cells within the reactor. Immobilization would seem to be advantageous as the capital expense of a cell recovery and recycle system can be eliminated. There has been a good deal of work over the last 10-15 years on immobilizing organisms to maintain a high cell density in the bioreactor. Immobilization can take one of several approaches, 1) entrapment within a gel bead or plate, 2) adsorption onto a solid matrix, or 3) self-agglomeration or flocculation into flakes or pellets.

Increasing temperature generally speeds a fermentation until the temperature becomes high enough to cause cell death. Fermentation rates are generally noted to increase from 20° to 32° C., doubling with a 5° C. increase in temperature.

The traditional process of fermentation is carried out in a conventional batch operation utilizing yeast as the fermenting organism. To increase the efficiency a variation of the batch operation occasionally includes recycling of the yeast cells by systems such as sedimentation, centrifugation, or ultrafiltration. Normally this batch operation is conducted in two stages. The first stage involves propagation of the yeast and is referred to as the growth stage. The second stage involves the anaerobic process of ethanol production which is accompanied by a depletion of the oxygen. Further propagation of the yeast occurs during the anaerobic process of ethanol production.

Typically, a yeast inoculum is prepared in stage one. The requirements for maximum yeast reproduction are adequate amounts of carbon, nitrogen, minerals and oxygen, a pH in the range of 3.5 to 4.5, and a temperature in the range of 29°-35° C. Aerobic growth conditions define a system for more efficient production of yeast but under which no ethanol is produced. Stage two is the fermentation stage where the alcohol is actually produced by the yeast from the fermentable sugars. The yeast inoculum produced in stage one is used to seed a large fermenter containing glucose at appropriate pH, temperature and sugar concentration. Glucose was formed from the conversion of dextrins via saccharification enzymes. The dextrins were derived from molasses, corn starch materials, etc. via liquification enzymes. The inoculation rate can be 5 to 10 million cells per ml and during the fermentation the viable cell count can increase to 150-200 million cells per ml. Heat produced is controlled through the use of cooling coils. At these yeast levels, a final ethanol concentration of about 9 to 11% (v/v) can be obtained in 30 to 70 hours with batch fermentation. Increasing the yeast content, as is the case with cell recycle, can considerably reduce the time required for completion of the fermentation. For example, with a cell density of 800 to 1000 million cells per ml, it is possible to reduce the fermentation time to 4 to 10 hours.

Processes for the continuous fermentation of sugars to provide alcohol are also well known (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,155,134; 2,371,208; 2,967,107; 3,015,612; 3,078,166; 3,093,548; 3,177,005; 3,201,328; 3,207,605; 3,207,606; 3,219,319; 3,234,026; 3,413,124; 3,528,887; 3,575,813; 3,591,454; 3,705,841; 3,737,323; and 3,940,492 “Process Design and Economic Studies of Alternative Fermentation Methods for the Production of Ethanol”, Cysewski, et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. xx, pp. 1421-1444 (1978)). In a typical continuous fermentation process, a stream of sterile sugar liquor and a quantity of yeast cells are introduced into the first of a battery of fermentation vessels wherein initial fermentation takes place, generally under conditions favoring rapid cell growth. The partial fermentate admixed with yeast cells is continuously withdrawn from the first fermentation vessel wherein fermentation is carried out under conditions favoring the rapid conversion of sugar to ethanol. The yeast in the last fermentation vessel can be recovered by suitable means, e.g., centrifugation or settlement, and recycled. In such a system, the ability of the fermentation organism to produce ethanol is affected by the ethanol and sugar concentrations. As a rule, a yeast which gives high conversion rates of sugar to ethanol in a low-ethanol, high-sugar fermentation medium will only sluggishly produce ethanol under the opposite conditions, i.e., at high-ethanol level, low-sugar concentrations.

In general, however, the price of bioethanol has not been competitive with that of traditional fossil fuels and it is therefore highly needed to reduce production costs as far as possible by optimizing or improving upon bioethanol production technologies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an anaerobic fermentation process to enhance or improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time. A process is disclosed using a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions for the enhanced production of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar containing source. The process for producing ethanol by anaerobic fermentation comprises converting a carbohydrate or sugar source to ethanol using an ethanol producing microorganism in a fermentation broth, wherein said fermentation broth contains one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water, whereby said ethanol production is enhanced.

In another embodiment, a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions is used to increase or enhance ethanol production from the fermentation of an ethanol producing microorganism. A fermentation broth for the fermentation of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar source can comprise an ethanol producing microorganism, one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water.

The present invention provides a viable commercial method for ethanol production and can be used in, for example, fuel ethanol, industrial, cheese, brewing, and wine making industries.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes provided with a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and teeth. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefor, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to a toothbrush with a novel arrangement of cleaning elements to provide superior cleaning of the teeth.

In one aspect of the invention, a toothbrush includes a head having a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a base surface. The tooth cleaning elements generally define a loop arrangement to better retain the dentifrice proximate to the contact between the bristles and the teeth for more effective cleaning. In one preferred construction, each loop is formed by a plurality of independently flexible cleaning elements so as to maintain user comfort and provide improved cleaning of the teeth.

In another aspect of the invention, other cleaning elements are disposed within the cleaning elements forming the loop. In this construction, these central cleaning elements are strategically located to maximize the cleaning effect of the retained dentifrice.

In another aspect of the invention, tooth cleaning elements are positioned along the periphery of the head. In one preferred construction, these peripheral cleaning elements are stepped and tapered to clean along the gum line and reach the interproximal areas between the teeth.

The present invention also pertains to combinations of different kinds of cleaning elements on a single head that cooperate to provide a pattern for overall improved cleaning of the teeth, including effective cleaning of the rear teeth, the interproximal areas between the teeth, along the gum line, and the lingual and facial side surfaces of the teeth.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, in particular, to a toothbrush with a powered head having fixed and movable tuft blocks.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which tooth cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the tooth cleaning elements are attached.

Conventional toothbrushes have tooth cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the tooth cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the tooth cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

It would be desirable to provide a powered toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The principles of the invention may be used to provide a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In accordance with a first aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. At least one fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to each fixed tuft block and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block with respect to each fixed tuft block

In accordance with another aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and is spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first fixed tuft block and the second fixed tuft block by an elastomeric member. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner with respect to the first and second fixed tuft blocks.

In accordance with a further aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to a distal end of the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to a proximate end of the head in a fixed orientation and spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first tuft block and the second tuft block by an elastomeric membrane and has a base portion including a slot. A battery is mounted inside the handle, and a motor is operably connected to the battery. A drive shaft is rotatably driven by the motor and has an offset portion that engages the slot in the movable tuft block to drive the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner.

Substantial advantage is achieved by providing a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In particular, certain embodiments improve cleaning of teeth and gums, and provide improved access to and contact with areas of the teeth located at a distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between the teeth.

These and additional features and advantages disclosed here will be further understood from the following detailed disclosure of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant and/or deodorant compositions are used to reduce the sweat in an axillary (underarm) region and/or to kill bacteria in this region to reduce or eliminate body odor caused by bacterial growth in this region. Antiperspirants/deodorants can be provided in many forms, such as a roll on, a gel, or as a solid stick. These compositions are applied to the axillary region, and they dry as the volatile carriers evaporate away to leave the active material. When roll on or gel compositions dry, they can leave the skin feeling tacky with a wet feeling.

It would be desirable to provide an antiperspirant/deodorant composition that reduces or eliminates the tacky and or wet feeling, and in particular for roll-on applications where the water content is usually more than 50% of the formula.

"BACKGROUND

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending materials such as beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The methods of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants to structure the liquid, or by the addition of structuring agents such as polymers, natural gums and clays which enable the liquid to suspend materials therein for long periods of time. These suspended materials can be functional, aesthetic or both. By aesthetic it is meant that the suspended materials impart a certain visual appearance that is pleasing or eye catching. By functional it is meant that the suspended materials contribute to the action of the composition in cleaning, fragrance release, shine enhancement, or other intended action of the composition.

The suspension of materials, however, in a structured cleaning liquid composition by the aforementioned use of surfactants, polymers, natural gums and clays has characteristics that consumers often do not associate with acceptable liquid dish detergents. Conventional structured liquids are often opaque or turbid thereby obscuring the visual appeal to the consumer of the suspended materials which are shown to best advantage in a nearly transparent or clear liquid.

Further, a side effect of structuring a liquid to suspend materials is that it causes a significant increase in liquid viscosity and a corresponding decrease in liquid pourability and ease of dissolution in water. Both properties are generally not considered consumer acceptable, particularly, in liquid cleaning products like hand dishwashing liquid. Finally, the dissolution rate of the structured liquid in water is desired to be rapid so that foam generation is not delayed. Foam is a signal to consumers that the detergent is high quality. Pourability and dissolution are in part linked to liquid viscosity.

When structuring a liquid detergent with a high surfactant content, the ionic strength of the surfactants can cause a collapse of structuring agents that can be included to provide structure to the liquid. To overcome the collapse of the structuring agents, a higher amount of structuring agents may be required, but this can reduce the water dispersability of the liquid detergent and increase the cost. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a structured liquid that can suspend particles and still have a desired pourability and dissolution rate.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, that include movable cleaning features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant and/or deodorant compositions are used to reduce the sweat in an axillary (underarm) region and/or to kill bacteria in this region to reduce or eliminate body odor caused by bacterial growth in this region. Antiperspirants/deodorants can be provided in many forms, such as a roll on, a gel, or as a solid stick. These compositions are applied to the axillary region, and they dry as the volatile carriers evaporate away to leave the active material. When roll on or gel compositions dry, they can leave the skin feeling tacky with a wet feeling.

It would be desirable to provide an antiperspirant/deodorant composition that reduces or eliminates the tacky and or wet feeling, and in particular for roll-on applications where the water content is usually more than 50% of the formula.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes provided with a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to a toothbrush with a novel arrangement of cleaning elements to provide superior cleaning of the teeth.

In one aspect of the invention, a toothbrush includes a head having a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a base surface. The tooth cleaning elements generally define a loop arrangement to better retain the dentifrice proximate to the contact between the bristles and the teeth for more effective cleaning. In one preferred construction, each loop is formed by a plurality of independently flexible cleaning elements so as to maintain user comfort and provide improved cleaning of the teeth.

In another aspect of the invention, other cleaning elements are disposed within the cleaning elements forming the loop. In this construction, these central cleaning elements are strategically located to maximize the cleaning effect of the retained dentifrice.

In another aspect of the invention, tooth cleaning elements are positioned along the periphery of the head. In one preferred construction, these peripheral cleaning elements are stepped and tapered to clean along the gum line and reach the interproximal areas between the teeth.

The present invention also pertains to combinations of different kinds of cleaning elements on a single head that cooperate to provide a pattern for overall improved cleaning of the teeth, including effective cleaning of the rear teeth, the interproximal areas between the teeth, along the gum line, and the lingual and facial side surfaces of the teeth.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care instrument, such as a motorized toothbrush, which activates upon exposure to the oral environment of the user.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Powered oral care instruments such as electric, motorized toothbrushes used to clean teeth are well known. Typically these toothbrushes employ vibrating or rotating motion, or a combination of motions, to effectuate tooth cleaning, whitening, and/or repair. Toothbrushes may also include a motorized activator, such as a pump, for dispensing active agents to one or more outlets.

A feature commonly found on electric toothbrushes and other oral care instruments is an on/off switch or button which may be shifted or depressed to electrically activate or deactivate the instrument.

In the case of an electric toothbrush, for example, activation establishes an electrical circuit which causes movement of the bristles for contacting tooth and soft tissue surfaces, or dispensing of an active agent. The switch is typically located on or near the handle portion of the toothbrush. The primary feature of such a switch is that it remains either in the “on” position or the “off” position until the user manually changes it. The toothbrush motor can be engaged or activated prior to the brush head being placed in the mouth, or the user can wait until the brush head is placed within the mouth before activating the motor.

It would be desirable to provide a toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known toothbrushes. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY

Aspects of the present invention advantageously exploit particular conditions which are present in the mouth, either continually or at discreet instances during oral care or treatment. The electrical conductivity of saliva, optionally mixed with toothpaste and water, may be utilized to activate or complete an electrical circuit that powers the instrument. The existence of one or more such conditions provides a basis for automatic functioning of the oral care instrument when a portion (e.g., the head, or the head and neck) is placed into the mouth and the condition, or a combination of conditions, is/are detected.

In accordance with one aspect, a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements and a handle configured to connect to a power source. A motorized device is activated upon exposure of the toothbrush to an electrolyte solution.

In accordance with another aspect, a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements, a handle including a cavity, and a power source received in the cavity of the handle. A motorized device is operably connected to the power source and operably connected to the head. Electrical conducting elements are operably connected to the power source and the motorized device. The motorized device is activated upon exposure of the electrical conducting elements to an electrolyte solution.

In accordance with a further aspect a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements, a handle, and a power source contained within the handle. A motorized device is operably connected to the power source and operably connected to the head. Electrical conducting elements are operably connected to the power source and the motorized device. A switch is operably connected to at least one of the electrical conducting elements and the power source. The motorized device is activated upon exposure of the electrical conducting elements to an electrolyte solution having a threshold conductivity.

These and other aspects of the invention are apparent from the following detailed description of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

When developing personal cleansing compositions for use in the shower, bath or sink, it is desired to minimize the amount of cleaning of the composition from the shower, bath, or sink. It is desired for the compositions to deposit as little as possible on a substrate to minimize the cleaning.

To measure the actual deposition of a composition onto sanitary ware would require actual use of the composition. This would require a significant amount of labor and time to have people use compositions in the shower, bath, or sink. It would be desirable to reduce this amount of labor and time.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a method of measuring the deposition of a composition onto a substrate. This information can be used to correlate how the composition will deposit on sanitary ware, such as shower cubicles, baths, and wash basins.

In particular, the present invention relates to a method for measuring the residue left by a composition on a substrate, the method comprising:a) providing a substrate;b) weighing the substrate to obtain an initial weight;c) providing in a container a mixture comprising a measured amount of water of a desired hardness and a measured amount of a composition to be tested;d) immersing the substrate in the mixture for a time sufficient to allow the composition to wet the substrate;e) removing the substrate and allowing excess mixture to drain off of the substrate;f) drying the substrate; andg) weighing the substrate to obtain a final weight.

The method may further comprise, between steps b) and c), rinsing and drying the substrate by rinsing the substrate in the following at room temperature: i) tap water; then ii) de-ionized water; then iii) 200 proof ethanol; then iv) reagent grade Acetone; and then air drying the substrate.

The method may further comprise, to provide the mixture in the container in step c),

ii) inserting a mixer into the container;

iii) adjusting the container and water to a desired temperature;

iv) adding the composition to be tested to form the mixture;

v) mixing the mixture;

vi) optionally adjusting the mixture to a desired temperature; and

vii) stopping mixing.

Optionally, in the immersion step d), if the substrate is not fully immersed in the mixture, the substrate is initially partially immersed and then removed from the mixture, rotated about 180 degrees, and then placed back into the mixture so as to be partially immersed again in the mixture.

Optionally, the method further comprises comparing the initial and final weights to determine the weight of residue adhering to the substrate.

Optionally, the method further comprises determining the unit weight of the residue per unit area of the substrate by dividing the weight of residue by the total surface area of the substrate.

Preferably, the composition is a personal cleansing composition, and the substrate is composed of a material selected from the group consisting of glass, ceramic, porcelain, tile, acrylic, and fiberglass. More preferably, the method is for correlating the amount of residue left by the composition on sanitary ware when the personal cleansing composition is used in a bathroom.

In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method comprising:a) selecting a substrate of a known initial weight;b) optionally, rinsing the substrate in the following at room temperature:

i) tap water;

ii) de-ionized water;

iii) 200 proof ethanol;

iv) reagent grade Acetone;

v) air drying the substrate; and

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a powered toothbrush refill head that includes an oscillating block having bristles. Various types of such toothbrushes are generally known in the art. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 which relates to an electrically driven toothbrush which includes a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft is connected to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 describes a motorized toothbrush having two concentrically arranged brushes coaxially supported in a shell. The brushes are driven by a drive shaft connected to a spindle which is bent to form two inclined arms at its end. Each of the arms is located in a slot in each respective brush. When the drive shaft is rotated the inclined aims cause each brush to rotate about their axis in opposite directions to each other.

The motorized toothbrush described in PCT International Publication No. WO 00/78244 similarly includes two coaxially mounted first and second brush heads which rotationally oscillate with respect to each other in different directions and/or at different speeds. Two different drive mechanisms are disclosed. One drive mechanism includes a linearly reciprocating actuator to which two connecting rods are attached. The connecting rods are formed from a single piece of wire generally V-shaped with an end of each connecting rod being mounted to a different one of the brush heads. As the actuator and connecting rods are moved linearly back and forth the ends of the connecting rods are moved toward and away from each other to cause the brush heads to rotate. In the second embodiment each brush head is provided with a toothed region which engages a conical year at the distal end of a rotationally oscillating shaft so that rotational oscillation of the shaft is transmitted by the conical gear to each toothed region to thereby rotationally oscillate the brush heads.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,030 discloses a rather complicated arrangement for a dental cleaning device having two brush holders. One of the brush holders is reciprocated about a pivotal axis as a result of a pivotal coupling between the brush holder and a connecting rod in the drive means. The other brush holder is also reciprocated about a pivotal axis as a result of a coupling between the brush holder and a drive member of the drive means. Although the two brush holders are located adjacent to each other the reciprocation of one of the brush holders is not utilized to cause the reciprocation of the other brush holder. Instead, both brush holders oscillate as a result of each brush holder being coupled to the drive means.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,237,178 discloses a toothbrush having a bristle holder which is rotated reciprocally along a circularly arcuate path. An interdental bristle holder is mounted longitudinally outwardly of the bristle holder. The patent states that the interdental bristle holder is reciprocatingly movable transversely to the longitudinal axis and is in driving engagement with the bristle holder so that the interdental bristle holder reciprocates transversely to the longitudinal axis when the bristle holder is reciprocated along the circularly arcuate path. The drawings, however, illustrate the interdental bristle holder to have an arcuate edge which is parallel to and extends partially around the arcuate edge of the bristle holder40. Accordingly, there would be little room for any significant transverse reciprocation.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,308,358 discloses a toothbrush having a bristle holder and an interdental bristle holder. The patent states that each of these bristle holders performs a pivotal movement along a circular path, but does not state how the bristle holders are driven.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,242,516 discloses a toothbrush having a central set of bristles with a further set of bristles on each side thereof. The central set is driven by a drive mechanism. The central set includes a gear which meshes with gears for each of the other two sets so that rotation of the central set of brush elements will cause the other sets of brush elements to also rotate. No mention is made of rotating the brush elements back and forth in an oscillating manner.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,353,460 discloses a power driven toothbrush which uses a rather complicated drive arrangement including various types of gears and modified shaft structure to rotationally oscillate a brush carrier. The brush carrier is linked to a brush holder so that the brush holder is also rotationally oscillated.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,504,959 discloses an electric toothbrush wherein a pair of rotating bases holding brush bundles is rotatably mounted in a pair of pins secured to a slider. A pinion is secured to each base for engagement with a rack of a holder. The slider is mounted in the holder and moved longitudinally by a drive mechanism. As the slider moves longitudinally the engagement or the pinions with the rack causes the bases to rotate in a reciprocating motion to thereby reciprocatingly rotate the brush bundles.

PCT International Publication No. WO 01/91603 discloses a toothbrush having sets of bristle tufts which reciprocate in their angular orientation.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a powered toothbrush refill head which is capable of delivering a cleaning, polishing, whitening action in addition to the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush refill product.

A further object of this invention is to provide various techniques for adding to the cleaning efficiency of an oscillating block in the toothbrush head.

In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head includes a primary tuft block mounted to the head. The primary tuft block is mounted in such a manner as to oscillate back and forth preferably rotationally. The head includes a secondary tuft block which is driven to further oscillate back and forth while the primary tuft block is oscillated back and forth.

In one practice of this invention the secondary tuft block is interconnected with the primary tuft block so that oscillating rotation of the primary tuft block causes an oscillating rotation of the secondary tuft block.

In accordance with a further practice of this invention the secondary tuft block comprises a plurality of side by side plates connected to the primary tuft block in such a manner that the side by side plates oscillate linearly in a direction parallel to the handle of the toothbrush while the primary tuft block is oscillating.

In still yet another practice of this invention the secondary tuft block is a plurality of rows of bars extending, laterally across the head perpendicular to the handle. The bars oscillate back and forth across the tuft head in a direction perpendicular to the handle while the primary tuft block is oscillating.

"BACKGROUND

Perfume is an important component of modern fabric softeners, particularly those delivered through the rinse cycle of a washing machine and those present in dryer sheets and other forms. It is estimated that the cost of perfume may represent about 50% of the overall formula cost of a typical rinse cycle fabric softener. However, there is often a high volume of wasted perfume in the laundry process; instrumental measurements have indicated that about 50 to 70% of the perfume ingredients in a commercial liquid fabric softener typically remain in the washing liquor, and thus are never deposited on the fabrics being treated.

Consequently, increasing perfume deposition efficiency onto fabrics is desirable because it may allow for a significant decrease in waste and cost of a commercial fabric softening product. Furthermore, by improving the deposition efficiency of the volatile ingredients in a perfume, new perfume notes can be introduced into fabric softening compositions and more effectively deposited onto treated fabrics.

In laundry products such as fabric softeners, the presence of a perfume is intended to make the compositions more aesthetically pleasing to consumers. Apart from the point of purchase perception, the perfume additives may impart a pleasant and longer lasting fragrance to fabrics that are treated therewith. However, as noted above, with regard to liquid fabric softening compositions that are added during the laundry process, the major portion of the perfume is often lost in the wash solution during the wash and therefore wasted.

Attempts have been made in the art to increase the efficiency and deposition of perfumes on fabrics. For example, the use of cross-linked cationic vinyl polymers has been discussed and explored in conjunction with fabric conditioning formulations and personal care compositions as a thickening agent, for example in International Patent Publication No. WO 90/12862 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,345. Various methods for achieving controlled active release have been developed. One of the simplest of such embodiments is described in Canadian Patent No. 1,111,616 to Young, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,792 to Shefer et al., which describe incorporation of perfumes into wax. U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,271 describes encapsulation technology for entrapping softener compositions and fragrance oils in solid particles. An example of such microencapsulation technology is embodied in capsules with perfume, which are broken under friction to provide an instant “burst” of fragrance when the capsules are ruptured.

These types of capsules may behave differently depending on the compositions with which they are used. In particular, they may be disadvantageous in that they can often leak in aqueous compositions containing high levels of surfactants and lower alcohols. As it is desirable to provide perfumed articles that are stable in fluid compositions but still liberate perfume during use, different approaches have been used; for example, building a coating around the particles as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,646, or encapsulating perfume materials together with high C log P solvents to enable the fragrances to remain in the capsules for extended times without leaching from the capsules, as described in European Patent Publication No. 1 533 364 A3. However, there is an ongoing need for the improvement of perfume efficiency and deposition on fabrics and the capture of the more volatile ingredients of a perfume for fabric deposition.

The present invention is directed, in certain embodiments, to a cross-linked polymeric material designed as a perfume “sponge” to retain volatile perfume ingredients. In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a polymeric material capable of increasing the efficiency of perfume deposition on fabrics such as cotton when used in conjunction with a rinse cycle fabric softening composition.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

When doing household chores, such as dish washing, dusting or laundry, many consumers may wish to experience a pleasant fragrance or odor as well as to recognize the cleaning attributes of their selected cleaning compositions. For example, in dish washing liquids, consumers value cleaning efficacy; however, given the choice between equally efficacious formulations, one of which promise to deliver fragrance and one of which does not, some consumers will select the formulation that promises fragrance delivery as an additional benefit.

Prior approaches to improving fragrance delivery include the inclusion of dish fragrances able to develop blooming or intense odors in to, e.g., dish washing liquids. However, these fragrances may overpower the consumer or linger to long of the cleaned surfaces. Other approaches include lowering the total surfactant level of the dish washing liquid; this approach has the disadvantage of reducing the cleaning efficacy of the dish washing composition.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a cleaning composition that delivers fragrance in an acceptable manner and exhibits a cleaning efficacy that is similar or better than the prior art compositions.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides a cleaning composition having grease removal and fragrance delivery properties. The invention composition includes at least two surfactants, which may be a cationic surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, a linear alkyl benzene sulfonate salt, a sulfated alcohol ethoxylate, an amine oxide, and an amphoteric surfactant. A fragrance compound is also included. The composition is characterized by a Cup test value of at least about 70% of the standard reference formula.

Also provided are the above described cleaning products in enclosed in a container. The container may include a dispensing orifice that has a diameter of about 2.0 mm to about 10 mm.

Methods of delivering fragrance to a space or to the olfactory apparatus of a user are also contemplated.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. While toothbrushes according to the prior art provide a number of advantageous features, they nevertheless have certain limitations. For example, certain toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice on the head for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced. The present invention seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and other drawbacks of the prior art, and to provide new features not heretofore available.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a configuration of cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of teeth.

In one aspect of the invention, an oral care implement has a head and a tooth cleaning element including a base connected to the head wherein the base has structure such that dentifrice applied to the head is adapted to be directed towards a distal region of the head.

In one aspect of the invention, the structure of the base includes an element that extends towards the distal region. The structure of the base may comprise a concave surface facing the distal region.

In another aspect, the base may also include a plurality of concave surfaces facing the distal region and positioned along the base.

In yet another aspect, the concave surfaces of the base may be substantially aligned along a longitudinal axis of the head. The longitudinal ends of the concave surfaces may be adjacent one another.

In another aspect, the base further has a protrusion extending from the concave surface towards the distal region.

In another aspect, the protrusion extends from the concave surface at a lowermost segment of the concave surface. The protrusion and concave surface may comprise a flexible material.

According to another aspect, an arcuate wall extends from the base. In this aspect, the base may have a plurality of arcuate walls positioned along a longitudinal axis.

In another aspect, the arcuate wall has a protuberance extending therefrom. The protuberance is positioned at a generally central location on the arcuate wall. A first arcuate wall extends from the base at one end of the concave surface of the protrusion and a second arcuate wall extending from the base and is spaced from the first arcuate wall at an opposite end of the concave surface. In one aspect, the protrusion is positioned between the first arcuate wall and the second arcuate wall wherein gaps are defined between the protrusion and the arcuate walls.

According to yet another aspect of the invention, the tooth cleaning elements with concave surfaces are positioned at a central location of the base. The concave surfaces are substantially aligned along a longitudinal axis of the head.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to a powered toothbrush and, in particular, to a powered toothbrush having a head with moving tooth cleaning elements and a moving tooth cleanser.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As toothbrush design has evolved in an effort to improve cleaning of teeth and gums, the complexity of toothbrushes and their functions have increased. Powered toothbrushes are one example of efforts to improve tooth cleaning by including one or more movable sets of cleaning elements.

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

Consequently, tissue cleansers have been added to a face of the head of a conventional toothbrush opposite the face on which the tooth cleaning elements are positioned.

It would be desirable to provide a powered toothbrush with a tooth cleanser that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY

The principles of the invention may be used to advantage to provide a powered toothbrush having a head with moving tooth cleaning elements and a moving tooth cleanser. In accordance with a first aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a toothbrush having a unique mounting of the cleaning elements, which is particularly beneficial in forming a contoured cleaning profile, and especially a contoured profile formed of tapered bristles. The present invention also pertains to a novel process for making such a toothbrush.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from tooth surfaces, the gums, the interproximal areas between adjoining teeth, and the marginal areas between the teeth and gums. Toothbrushes have been provided with a myriad of cleaning elements and profiles in an effort to provide comfort and enhanced cleaning. For example, toothbrushes with bristle tufts presenting a contoured profile have long been provided for more effective cleaning of the teeth and gums. Additionally, tapered bristles have been used for increased comfort and better cleaning of the interproximal areas.

However, the combined beneficial effect of tapered bristles and a contoured profile has not been realized. Typically, bristles are fixed into the head of a toothbrush and then trimmed to obtain the desired profile. This conventional process of trimming the bristles has hindered the adoption of tapered bristles into toothbrushes; i.e., tapered bristles have heretofore been limited to flat profiles to avoid trimming off of the tapered ends.

Further, the conventional manufacturing process for toothbrushes requires multiple steps to obtain a contoured profile, including the fixing of bristles into the head and one or more steps of trimming and endrounding of the fixed bristles.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with a unique mounting construction for the cleaning elements. This construction is especially effective in forming contoured cleaning profiles with tapered bristles.

In one aspect of the invention, cleaning elements are secured within the head at varying depths to enable greater versatility in cleaning arrangements and an improved manufacturing process

In another aspect of the present invention, tapered cleaning elements extend from a head of a toothbrush so as to form a contoured cleaning profile for more effective cleaning.

In another aspect of the invention, tapered bristles are uniquely mounted within the head of a toothbrush to define a contoured cleaning profile. In one construction, tapered bristles formed of different lengths are secured to the head in an arrangement to form the desired profile. In another construction, tapered bristles are secured at varying depths of insertion into the head to define the desired contoured cleaning profile.

In another aspect of the invention, a toothbrush is formed by fixing cleaning elements into the head of the toothbrush at varying depths. Alternatively, tapered bristles having alternative lengths can be fixed into the head. With either of these processes, a contoured cleaning profile can be formed without trimming and endrounding of the cleaning elements. The elimination of such conventional post-fixing step(s) can enhance the manufacture of such brushes. Moreover, with this process, tapered cleaning elements can be effectively used in a toothbrush having a contoured profile.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser for cleansing the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, bad breath in healthy people is often attributable to microbial deposits on the tongue. Due to its papillary nature, the tongue creates a unique ecological site that provides a large surface area, which favors the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue can lead to the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers have not adequately met the need. Past scrapers have typically been uncomfortable, risked injury to the user, and/or lacked effectiveness. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of bacteria and other debris with comfort and safety.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser provided with a unique combination of hard and soft materials to effectively cleanse the tongue and other soft tissue within the mouth with comfort and a reduced risk of injury to the user.

In one aspect of the invention, a tongue cleanser is formed of two components that combine to define at least one cleaning projection that extends from a head of an implement. One component of the tongue cleanser is composed of a relatively hard material to provide stability and effective cleaning of the soft tissue. The other component is composed of a relatively soft material to provide comfort and safety to the user during use of the implement.

In one exemplary construction of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes a base composed of a relatively hard material that protrudes from a surface of the head, and a soft material that at least partially overlies the base. The hard base provides good stability for cleaning bacteria and debris from the tongue or other tissue, while the soft layer provides comfort and a reduced risk of injury. In one embodiment, the tip of the base is covered with the soft material. In another embodiment, a small extension of the base tip is exposed through the soft material.

In another exemplary construction, the tongue cleanser includes a projection formed of a soft material, which is embedded in a hard base for enhanced rigidity. In one embodiment, the projection is a tapering member with a narrow tip to engage and clean soft tissue in the mouth and a wide base portion anchored in a hard material portion of the head. The soft material engages the tongue for comfort and safety. The hard material provides enhanced stiffness and stability to the cleanser.

In another aspect of the invention, a tongue cleanser is formed of two components of various topographies. One component of the tongue cleanser is composed of a relatively hard material, while the other component is composed of a relatively soft material.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant and deodorant products can be in the form of gels or lotions. These usually are sold in oval shaped dispensers where the lotion or gel is in the body of the dispenser. The dispenser is comprised of a barrel which is closed by a base on a lower end and has a plurality of dispensing openings on an upper end. The base may support an elevator which assists in dispensing the gel or lotion through the plurality of dispensing apertures. The elevator can be moved manually or through an elevator wheel activation mechanism attached to the base. The plurality of apertures usually is closed with a peelable foil seal. This is removed by the user and discarded. This foil provides a good seal. However, it requires another operation in the manufacturing process to apply the seal to the dispenser. Further, if the foil seal is not properly applied there can be leakage from the dispenser.

A new seal has been developed which gives leak proof seals. This seal is formed just subsequent to the formation of the barrel. The barrel is molded and a thermoplastic seal, preferably a thermoplastic elastomer seal, then is molded onto the barrel. The thermoplastic seal flows into each of the plurality of dispensing apertures of the barrel and separately seals each of these openings. This thermoplastic seal usually will be a one-time use seal. However a reusable seal adopting this concept could be developed for particular products if one is needed.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a thermoplastic seal for a dispenser. More particularly this invention relates to a seal unit where projections on a thermoplastic elastomer seal close dispensing apertures of a dispenser.

The dispenser is comprised of a barrel, a base closing the barrel at one end of the barrel and a plurality of dispensing apertures on a surface at another end of the barrel. A seal unit closes the plurality of openings. The seal unit is a thermoplastic, and preferably a thermoplastic elastomer, having an elongated section with a plurality of projections from one side, each of the plurality of projections aligned to enter and to seal the plurality of dispensing apertures.

The base can support an elevator which assists in the dispensing of the substance in the barrel. The elevator can be adjusted by means of a threaded screw or moved manually in the barrel.

The seal unit in the preferred embodiment is of a single use type where it is removed and discarded. However it could be designed so that it can be replaced on the barrel to reseal the plurality of apertures. Additionally there can be one or more grip tabs on the seal unit to assist in its removal from the barrel. In a further preferred embodiment the projections should have coordinated tapers whereby the tips of projections have cross-sectional dimensions that are less than those of the aperture openings. This will provide for an ease in removing the seal but yet provide for a leakproof seal.

The seal unit is formed subsequent to the molding of the barrel. The thermoplastic of the seal unit is molded into the plurality of openings of the upper aperture surface of the barrel. In a preferred mode the seal unit is molded onto the barrel in the same mold in which the barrel is molded. This is through the use of injection molding and a two shot molding technique.

As used herein the thermoplastic can be any one of a class of thermoplastics, inclusive of the preferred thermoplastic elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers are multi-phase compositions in which the phases are intimately dispersed or are bonded by block or graft copolymerization. When repeatedly heated they will flow and then reset to a flexible solid. They are comprised of a hard segment and a soft segment. The only restriction is that the thermoplastic elastomer must be substantially inert to the substance contained in the barrel and which is to be dispensed.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The field of the present invention relates generally to condoms, and more specifically to condoms having a lubricant system which imparts warmth, or provides a warming effect or sensation upon use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of lubrication systems for condoms are disclosed in the art. Some of the lubricants employed are sold or supplied separately as so-called personal lubricants, while others are applied to condoms prior to packaging. Some lubricants have particular physiological effects. For example, Heidenfelder (U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,188) discloses the coating of the interior surface of a condom with a local anesthetic such as benzocaine to provide desensitization.

The instant invention is directed to a condom together with a lubricant which provides a warming effect or sensation upon use. This effect is in contrast to the cooling sensation imparted by conventional lubricants.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally provides a condom in combination with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols. Such glycols, provided they are present in an environment relatively free from unbound water, will warm upon contact with compositions containing unbound water. Such warming of glycol based condom lubricants results in a warming sensation during condom use.

In one aspect of the present invention there is provided a condom comprising:

A male genital engaging tubular sheath having an inner surface and an outer surface together with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols in a mixture containing little or no unbound water, such that said lubricating composition warms upon contact with compositions containing free or unbound water.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a display carton blank, and display carton for a plurality of products where the contained products are maintained in a set array in the carton. The carton is comprised of a carton and a separator, the separator being maintained in place by recesses in the sidewalls of the carton. The carton front surface can be at least partially transparent. Other surfaces also can be at least partially transparent.

Many products are sold in amounts of two to ten or more. Many of these products are preferably displayed and maintained in a set array in the carton. Being maintained in a set array is useful in cases where the units are to be seen through an at least partially transparent front surface. The units that can be seen through the front surface can be a significant factor in the product being purchased. The products are preferably displayed neatly to convey the proper message about the product to the prospective purchaser. In addition, the carton should be of a low cost, structurally stable, tamper evident and versatile in display. As used herein, versatile in display means that the carton can be displayed both resting on a store shelf and suspended from a peg or similar hardware that extends outwardly from a vertical support. When the product can be displayed sitting on a store shelf it then also can be stored on a shelf at the purchaser's residence. Storability by the purchaser is convenient because the units in the carton may be used over a period of time. The carton should have sufficient structural stability so as not to be damaged during shipping and handling and display at the retail outlet. It also should be sufficiently durable to protect the contained units from any damage. To be tamper evident, it should be discernable from a casual inspection whether the carton has been the subject of any tampering.

The present carton solves the above problems through a unique structure for the carton. The carton has a unique carton structure, a unique product separator structure, and a unique carton/product separator interfitting structure. Low cost is achieved by the use of a design that minimizes the amount of material yet maintains sufficient strength. This results in a display carton for a plurality of products at a low cost, one which is structurally stable, is tamper evident, and is versatile in display.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a display carton for a plurality of products. In one embodiment, the carton comprises a front panel and a rear panel, the front panel and the rear panel connected one to the other by a top panel and a bottom panel, each of the front panel, the top panel and the bottom panel having appended side flaps. Each of the top panel and side panel appended side flaps has a recess, the recesses of the top panel flaps being in alignment with the recesses of the bottom panel flaps to form combined recesses in the sidewall of the carton. There is a product separator within the carton, the product separator having a separator panel with an appended first panel and an appended second panel, each of the first panel and the second panel being fitted into the combined recess in the sidewall of the carton to thereby secure the product separator within the carton. The product separator maintaining the position of the products displayed in the carton.

The carton has at least one surface which is at least partially transparent in order to display the container products. This preferably is the front surface. Other surfaces, such as the top surface can be at least partially transparent. The product separator will maintain the product units adjacent the front panel and any other panel with an at least partially transparent surface in a neat array.

The front panel side flaps have appended glue flaps, there being a score line between each of the side flaps and the glue flaps. The glue flap is at an angle to the side flap. Each glue flap has a plurality glue tabs, the appended glue flaps attaching to the rear panel of the carton.

The first panel and the second panel of the product separator have a shape which conforms to the shape of the combined recesses, the first panel and the second panel preferably having a rectangular shape with the combined recesses having a conforming rectangular shape.

The top panel has an attached first hanger panel and the rear panel has an attached second hanger panel, the first hanger panel and the second hanger panel jointly forming a common hanger panel of the carton. The second hanger panel has breakaway glue tabs to secure the rear panel in a closed position and a remaining bendable tab to maintain the rear panel closed.

The product separator has apertures and a product separator weakened area to promote a partial fold. The apertures provide for a gripping of the product separator. The partial fold provides for a way to insert and to remove the product separator. The product separator provides for product to be maintained between the front panel and the product separator and the rear panel and the product separator.

The carton is constructed from a carton blank which is comprised of a front panel with an attached top panel at one end and an attached bottom panel at another end. A rear panel is attached to the bottom panel. Each of the front panel, top panel and the bottom panel have side flaps, the rear panel being devoid of side flaps. The top panel has a first hanger panel and the rear panel has a second hanger panel, each hanger panel having an aperture. The top panel side flaps and the bottom panel side flaps each has a recess, the recesses aligning when the carton blank is formed into a carton to form common recesses.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

“Skin hygiene”, particularly of the hands, is a primary mechanism for reducing contact and transmission of infectious agents. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), despite the public awareness of the need to wash hands, the recommended methods of washing hands are not followed. The public does not wash frequently enough nor for sufficient time. It should also be noted, however, that too much time washing (scrubbing) could damage the skin. The Association for Professionals in Infections Control and Epidemiology (“APIC”) recommends washing hands by wetting hands with running water, applying hand-washing agent, thoroughly distributing it over hands, and vigorously rubbing hands for 10-15 seconds while covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers. The APIC recommends an antimicrobial soap or detergent or alcohol-based rub wash for 10-15 seconds to remove or kill transient micro-organisms, for example, in nursing and food preparation applications. The APIC further recommends an antimicrobial soap or detergent with brushing for at least 120 seconds for surgical applications. It is noteworthy to distinguish the difference between “killing” and “removing” germs. Killing germs can be accomplished by the use of specific ingredients that have deadly effect on the life cycle of the germs. Examples of ingredients that kill germs are Triclosan, PCMX (p-chloro-m-xylenol), Quats, surfactants, etc. An example of a formulation designed to kill germs is a sanitizer gel, which is applied to the hands for the purpose of killing germs, but does not remove the germs. The use of a soap, however, leads to the removal of germs, combined with a mild killing action. In this case, the length of time spent washing the hands can have a great impact on eradication of microbes.

Getting the timing right, however, is an issue. For children it is recommended that they sing the alphabet song once or happy birthday twice in order to wash their hands for 15 seconds. For adults there is no good indicator of when the time is up for efficient hand washing. Thus, there remains a need for a cleaning formulation that will provide an indication to the user how long he has washed his hands to indicate that the cleansing is effective and/or to comply with the health protocols.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A number of disease conditions are associated with the action of bacteria in the oral cavity. For example, gingivitis, an inflammation or infection of the gums and alveolar bones, is generally believed to be caused by plaque causing bacterial and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. In addition, plaque provides a locus for calculus or tartar formation. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar), which affects the periodontal ligaments. As plaque and tartar continue to build up, the gums begin to recede, which can lead to continued inflammation, infection and potentially the loss of teeth.

To prevent or treat these diseased conditions, antibacterial agents may be incorporated into oral care compositions such as toothpaste and mouthwashes or rinses. Application of antibacterial compositions in the oral cavity tends to retard plaque formation and related oral infections. It is also common to provide oral compositions containing components that remove or prevent the build-up of tartar. Effective antitartar agents, such as phosphates, are believed to work in-part by interfering with crystalline growth of hydroxyapatite on the tooth surface.

The antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds in a dentifrice composition depends on a number of factors, including the presence of other ingredients that may interfere with its action. For example, certain cationic antibacterial compounds and certain nonionic antibacterial compounds lose their effectiveness when formulated with certain anionic surfactants or other anionic active ingredients, such as tartar control phosphates. In many instances, it is preferred to use antibacterial compounds that do not show the adverse interactions with such anionic components.

Extracts fromMagnolia officinalis(hereinafter “magnolia”), and especially from the bark, contain biphenol antibacterial compounds. The extracts have been found to have antibacterial effectiveness when formulated into, for example, toothpaste formulations.

Extracts prepared from natural sources such as magnolia are variable in composition and may contain many compounds other than the particular actives for which the extract is prepared. In addition, the composition of the extracts can vary from season to season and between different geographical regions. For these many reasons, it may be desirable to synthesize naturally occurring products such as those found in magnolia extracts.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is based in part on the discovery that a particular analog of magnolol—5,5′-dibutyl-2,2′-dihydroxy-1,1′-biphenyl—is effective as an antiplaque and antibacterial component of dentifrices and other oral compositions. The invention relates to various oral compositions containing the compound and an orally acceptable carrier. In various embodiments, antibacterial and antiplaque oral compositions are provided in the form of a paste or gel, a powder, a mouthwash or mouth rinse, a lozenge, chewing gum, an edible strip, and the like. The antibacterial compound is synthesized by Friedel-Crafts type acylation of a biphenol compound, followed by reduction to the end product.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an oral care implement having an agent that can be delivered within the mouth of a user to provide enhanced oral heath.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

People exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. As a result, decreasing the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth has long been the target of persons working in the oral health care field.

The most common way of minimizing the harmful bacteria within the mouth is brushing with a dentifrice that delivers at least one oral care agent into the mouth. Orally introduced liquids, including oral rinses, are also utilized to provide additional oral care beyond that achieved while brushing. Mouthwashes may also be used to deliver breath freshening agents within the mouth in an attempt to eliminate bad breath.

Unfortunately, individuals do not always have the time for adequate oral care. For example, a busy person may not have the time or patience to brush thoroughly, floss and/or use an oral rinse. Alternatively, certain people may consider anything more than brushing their teeth to be unnecessary. For either reason, these people may leave a significant amount of harmful bacteria within their mouths after completing their oral care routines, which can begin to attack the teeth and gums.

Hence, there is a need for a toothbrush that delivers an agent during brushing to improve oral health.

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides an entertaining and/or educational interactive competition for a user.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush their teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

A toothbrush providing brushing behavior reinforcement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,633 to Rosen. A motion sensing means is used to monitor the brushing action of the user. When the logic requirements of motion sensing are complete, the logic means directs a digital output display means to output to a small LCD screen or speaker a visual and/or audible indication to the user, such as in the form of a rudimentary game or congratulatory message.

There remains a need for alternative techniques for promoting oral hygiene, and particularly for providing an incentive to users to brush their teeth for at least a minimum recommended brushing interval.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, that provides an entertaining and/or educational interactive competition for the user to promote improved oral hygiene.

The present invention provides an entertaining and/or educational environment in which a user/player brushes their teeth and interacts with a computer implemented game on a toothbrush. In one embodiment, an oral care implement provides for a synergistic combination of education and entertainment games pertaining to oral care hygiene. An individual is provided with an interactive reward in which virtual elements performing the educational functions form the basis of an interactive computer game for the user/player. Hence, an educational game directed to oral care can be more entertaining than simple instructions.

According to one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a plurality of lighted segments for indicating two or more oral care regions of the mouth. The oral care implement includes a computer processor for causing the segments to be sequentially lighted for prescribed intervals. The segments can be used to instruct a user to brush in a particular oral care region during the prescribed interval.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement includes a display screen for displaying images associated with oral care regions of the mouth, and an input device configured for interacting with the images. The images can be sequentially displayed to instruct the user to brush in particular oral care regions during sequential intervals.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

Bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, but have generally been inadequate in respect to their effectiveness and/or safety. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of nubs for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth and particularly for cleaning between the papillae of the tongue. In a further preferred aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes a plurality of conically shaped nubs.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser is constructed from an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleanser is formed as an elastomeric pad mounted on the head of the oral care implement for improved cleaning, ease of manufacture, and user comfort.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser includes at least one projection that protrudes from a base of material extending along the head of the implement. In one embodiment, a plurality of projections extend along the head in a spaced apart relationship along a pad formed as an elongate strip that is fixed to the head. In one construction, the base overlies a generally rigid head structure. Alternatively, the base is integrally formed as part of the head thereby forming a flexible head.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of at least one elongate ridge and a plurality of nubs or other discrete projections having a non-elongate structure. As a result, the tongue and other soft tissue of the mouth are cleaned with the benefit of both kinds of cleanser projections for an enhanced cleaning effect.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes a combination of hard and soft projections to clean the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth. In one construction, the cleanser includes a plurality of soft nubs and at least one elongate ridge of hard material. In this way, the combined benefits of a soft and hard cleanser can be gained in one implement.

In another aspect of the invention, the soft tissue cleanser includes at least one projection with a scraping edge to be moved over the tongue or other tissue. The edge is formed by sloped surfaces having different inclinations. In one construction, a steeper slope faces generally toward the handle to provide a more aggressive scraping action as the head is dragged out of the mouth. The shallower surface makes the projection less prone to pushing tongue biofilm farther back in the throat.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a seat to facilitate and ease molding of the tissue cleanser to the head. In one preferred construction, the head has one or more protuberances for anchoring the head during molding of the tissue cleanser. The head may also include a basin to further define the outline of the molded tissue cleanser.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement includes a tissue cleanser having means for reducing oral volatile sulfur compounds by 35% from a baseline measured two hours after use.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser for a thorough cleaning of the teeth, gums, tongue and oral surfaces of the cheeks and lips. In a preferred construction, the tooth cleaning elements and tissue cleanser are supported on opposite sides of a supporting head.

In one other aspect of the invention, an oral care implement which includes tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser forms at least one of the tooth cleaning elements as a unitary member with the tissue cleanser.

"BACKGROUND

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending materials such as beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The methods of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants to structure the liquid, or by the addition of structuring agents such as polymers, natural gums and clays which enable the liquid to suspend materials therein for long periods of time. These suspended materials can be functional, aesthetic or both. By aesthetic it is meant that the suspended materials impart a certain visual appearance that is pleasing or eye catching. By functional it is meant that the suspended materials contribute to the action of the composition in cleaning, fragrance release, shine enhancement, or other intended action of the composition.

The suspension of materials, however, in a structured cleaning liquid composition by the aforementioned use of surfactants, polymers, natural gums and clays has characteristics that consumers often do not associate with acceptable liquid dish detergents. Conventional structured liquids are often opaque or turbid thereby obscuring the visual appeal to the consumer of the suspended materials which are shown to best advantage in a nearly transparent or clear liquid.

Further, a side effect of structuring a liquid to suspend materials is that it causes a significant increase in liquid viscosity and a corresponding decrease in liquid pourability and ease of dissolution in water. Both properties are generally not considered consumer acceptable, particularly, in liquid cleaning products like hand dishwashing liquid. Finally, the dissolution rate of the structured liquid in water is desired to be rapid so that foam generation is not delayed. Foam is a signal to consumers that the detergent is high quality. Pourability and dissolution are in part linked to liquid viscosity.

When structuring a liquid detergent with a high surfactant content, the ionic strength of the surfactants can cause a collapse of structuring agents that can be included to provide structure to the liquid. To overcome the collapse of the structuring agents, a higher amount of structuring agents may be required, but this can reduce the water dispersability of the liquid detergent and increase the cost. Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a structured liquid that can suspend particles and still have a desired pourability and dissolution rate.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Sensates have been used in a wide range of consumer applications. For example, menthol is a well known sensate that is known for its immediate, sharp cooling effect, as well as its potential irritation and burning sensation when applied to skin. The addition of menthyl lactate (the lactate ester of menthol) to a personal care formulation containing menthol may partially offset these undesirable effects, providing a milder and more pleasant sensation.

Efforts are ongoing to formulate mild and non-irritating combinations of sensates in consumer products. While many sensates provide a cooling, tingling or refreshing sensation when incorporated into consumer products, some combinations may be too harsh for certain users, including those having high levels of sensitivity, e.g., children or adults with sensitive skin and/or mucous membranes. On the other hand, when the amounts of sensate materials, either alone or in combination, are sufficiently reduced in an effort to eliminate irritation, the beneficial and desirable cooling, tingling or refreshing sensations may be lost.

Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for personal care and oral care products comprising sensates that are able to provide beneficial and perceptible cooling, tingling or refreshing effects to the body, wherein said effects are mild and non-irritating for sensitive users, but still noticeable, pleasant and long-lasting.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It has been discovered that compositions comprising optimal ratios of two or more sensates, coupled with the addition of a cationic polymeric compound and, optionally, a solubilizer, results in compounds that are beneficial in that they are mild, but still retain the long lasting cooling, tingling and refreshing benefits desired when applied to the body.

The present invention is directed, in certain embodiments, to compositions comprising a first sensate, a second sensate and a cationic polymeric compound, and optionally a solubilizer.

The present invention is directed, in other embodiments, to methods for providing a cooling, tingling or refreshing sensation to the body, comprising application of a composition comprising a first sensate, a second sensate and a cationic polymeric compound to the body. In various embodiments, the methods described herein further provide the step of removing the composition from contact with the body.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to food products and ingredients that comprise combinations of compounds that alone and together can measurably enhance reported levels of mental energy, cognitive focus, and/or physical energy and especially during physical exercise or activity, such as during a sporting activity. The health bars, ingredients and products of the invention are heat-resistant, easily portable, and conveniently consumable. In preferred embodiments, the invention encompasses a health bar that contains high levels of cocoa, is shelf stable, and consumable before or during physical activity, as well as methods to make and effectively administer the health bars. As shown below, administration of exemplary health bars improves an athlete's score on several different performance related criteria.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Energy bars or drinks have been suggested for use by athletes that generally contain caffeine and sugars to stimulate or sustain alertness. High-protein bars have also been formulated for those attempting to gain muscle mass and strength. In addition, vitamin and other supplements are used in certain diets, again for specific conditions or consumers. The bars or supplements are not typically presented for use by the average consumer to increase mental and physical energy. Furthermore, refrigeration or cold storage is often not available for use during a sporting event. Thus the ideal health bar for consumption during a sporting event would be resistant to heat.

The combination of ingredients in the previously discussed bars or drinks, often including vitamins and other supplements, generally render them difficult to process into a stable bar format and not especially appetizing. The high protein levels can also absorb water, creating shelf stability problems. Furthermore, these products do not use cocoa as a healthful ingredient, but merely as part of a chocolate flavor, which generally employs only low levels of cocoa, necessarily delivering only low levels of cocoa anti-oxidants, below the minimal levels associated with healthful benefits.

From these deficiencies alone, one can conclude that new and improved methods for producing health bars and food ingredients with high levels of beneficial cocoa ingredients are needed.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the invention relates to the use of cocoa in novel bars, food ingredients or compositions to provide mental and physical energy or to improve performance or well-being during physical and/or mental stress, such as competitive athletic events. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods to produce health bars and compositions to generate a shelf stable, heat stable, and appetizing food product, as well as the food products themselves. In preferred aspects, the bars can contain specific ranges of available energy from carbohydrates/protein/fats, as recommended in certain diets or for certain populations. While high levels of cocoa, such as natural cocoa powder, cocoa liquor, or other cocoa solids-containing ingredients, are generally avoided in health bar-type products because of the astringent taste properties associated with cocoa, the bars of the invention can be made with acceptable and pleasant taste profiles even with high levels of natural cocoa. For example, over 20% or 25% or up to about 30% or even about 35% natural cocoa powder can be used in the health bars or food ingredients of the invention.

Thus, it is one object of the invention to provide a good tasting, chocolate-like product with a stable chewy and/or fudge-like texture that can deliver high levels of cocoa solids per standard serving of product. In particularly preferred embodiments, low-fat or non-fat cocoa solids are used as the cocoa product or one of the cocoa-containing products present. The concentrated level of cocoa solids used makes it possible for one to deliver high levels of cocoa anti-oxidant or polyphenol compounds, which have been shown to provide specific health benefits.

In another aspect, the invention involves the use of, and method of producing, a unique solid matrix for a health bar or composition in conjunction with high levels of cocoa or low to non-fat cocoa solids, and at levels similar to high cacao-containing standard chocolates and dark chocolate bars (typically 35%-70% or more cacao). In preferred embodiments, these high levels of cacao are achieved in a matrix that is at least 50% lower in fat and about 20% lower in calories than standard dark chocolate bars. The products and methods of the invention, and perhaps in particular the increased level of cocoa powder used, also provides superior heat resistance, such that the product can withstand temperatures in excess of 120 degrees F. without melting or becoming messy and undesirable for consumer handling. Furthermore, the characteristics of the high cacao compositions of the invention unexpectedly produce extrudable and rollable compositions without added water or required drying times, meaning the methods of the invention can be incorporated into a continuous process stream rather than a time-consuming, batch processing method as previously used. Conventional methods with the levels of cocoa as used herein, such as with the added cocoa powder, result in clumping and unflowable mixtures. In addition, the heat-resistant compositions do not require high levels of added starches or polyols to stabilize them.

The invention provides, in one aspect, a method of improving energy level in a subject by administering a heat-resistant, consumable cocoa anti-oxidant containing composition having about 8 grams or more of cocoa powder per dose, or the equivalent in cocoa solids, and given approximately one hour before and/or during physical activity. The amount of cocoa powder or equivalent can vary, as noted above, but a preferred range is about 8 to about 12 grams per serving or dose, or about 10 grams per serving or dose. In other embodiments, especially those involving methods to deliver certain amounts or high levels of cocoa or cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols per day, for example above 20 grams cocoa, or about 36 grams cocoa powder or its equivalent per day, and optionally over a sustain period of daily or multiple times per day treatment. Available or suggested regimens for a variety of health benefits or prophylactic treatments have been reported in the field, and the products, ingredients and methods of the invention can be useful in delivering, for example, about 20 to about 30 grams of cocoa powder or its equivalent per day, or about 30 to about 40 grams, or about 40 to about 50 grams, of even more than 50 grams of cocoa powder or its equivalent per day. The amount of cocoa present in a serving size or per gram can also be very high by the use of the invention, such as about 15 to about 20 or about 30 grams per serving size. Accordingly, multiple bars can be taken per day to deliver a desired amount of cocoa powder, its equivalent, or a desired amount of cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols per day, such as about 24 grams per day or about 75 grams per day of cocoa powder. Such administration regimens can have benefits in addition to the improved mental and physical energy effects noted here, such as improved cardiovascular condition or an improvement in the risk factors associated with cardiovascular or atherosclerotic conditions. The beneficial effects of cocoa antioxidants and polyphenols are known in the art, and the invention specifically includes the use of the products, bars, and ingredients to administer desired doses of cocoa or cocoa antioxidants or polyphenols, or any other specific compound naturally found in cocoa beans or nibs, to a person or animal. The amount of other foods consumed just before and during physical activity can be limited in order to maximize the energy-delivering effect, or minimize interference with the effect. When administered prior to or during physical activity, the effect on reported energy levels can be measured during and after the physical activity through standard means available in the art. In particular, questionnaires or other sampling of subjects to record physical energy levels, mental energy levels, ability to focus or concentrate on activity, or exhaustion or fatigue can be collected, and this data can be compared to controls where no cocoa solids or lower levels of cocoa solids are administered.

In another aspect, the invention provides a convenient health bar matrix capable of containing high levels of cocoa powder or cocoa solids, and which is specifically designed for use consistent with outdoor or physical activity. Thus, in one aspect, the health bar matrix is heat-resistant and shelf stable for at least about one month, or at least about 3 months, or at least about 6 months, or at least about 9 months, or about 12 months.

In yet another aspect, the invention provides a consumable composition, such as a chocolate bar, an energy bar, or food ingredient, that comprises about 20% or more cocoa solids and about 20% fat or less. Preferred ranges include about 20% to about 28% cocoa solids, and about 10% to about 20% fat. The cocoa solids can be provided in one or more available cocoa products produced from the cacao bean, such as cocoa powder or cocoa liquor. Various sources of cacao bean products are available and any one or any combination can be selected. In particular, the cacao bean source for a cocoa powder can be selected from one or more of unroasted cacao beans, unfermented cacao beans, medium roasted cacao beans, highly roasted cacao beans, blanched cacao beans, washed cacao beans, cacao beans selected for enhanced levels of polyphenols or particular polyphenol compounds, and extracts or any of these. Low fat or defatted cocoa products, such as defatted cocoa powder or low fat cocoa powder, enzyme treated cocoa powders (soluble cocoa) can also be used, and any of the above cacao beans can be prepared as a low fat or defatted cocoa product for use. In addition, any combination of these cacao bean products can be used. A preferred source of cocoa solids for taste is natural cocoa powder, meaning fermented, medium to high roast cocoa that is not dutched or alkaline processed. In addition, natural cocoa powder can be supplemented with cocoa extract, powder, or other products produced from an unfermented source of beans or other beans produced to have higher levels of cocoa flavanols, as well as other similar polyphenol-containing products available in the art. Natural cocoa powder supplemented with about 2%, or about 5%, or about 7%, or about 10% by weight cocoa powder or cocoa extract having these high levels of cocoa flavanols.

In a more particular aspect, the invention provides an energy bar or food ingredient for consumption during physical activity, or compatible with packaging and storage and use conditions for outdoor or physical activity, comprising an amount of cocoa product equivalent to about 23% or more cocoa solids in the final product, about 20% total fat or less, about 0.5% or less of a carrageenan or mixture of carrageenans, and sugar or mixture of sugars. The energy bar or food ingredient can preferably contains about 180 total calories or less, and more preferably about 140 total calories or less. The energy bar or food ingredient can also contain one or more vitamin, mineral, food supplement, botanical, or plant or herb extracts or ingredients known in the art or used in health bars or food supplements. The bar matrix is particularly suited to handling food supplement ingredients with particle sizes less than 50 microns at levels that can be significantly meaningful with regard to established dietary values. For instance, products with 50% (500 mg) or even 100% (1000 mg) of calcium (recommended daily amount or RDI) have been prepared with very acceptable organoleptic properties. In particular embodiments, the energy bar or food ingredient of the invention can comprise a fruit juice or extract, an herb or herb flavor, natural or artificial flavors, vitamins, minerals, anti-oxidant containing extracts, coenzyme Q, omega-3 fatty acids, guarana, caffeine, theobromine, epicatechin, EGCG (epigallocatechin gallate), maltodextrin, polyphenols, protein, and plant phytosterols. In another preferred embodiments, the energy bar or food ingredient can have total available energy levels of carbohydrates/protein/fat of 40/30/30 respectively. In another aspect, the energy bar or food ingredient can have a water activity level of about 0.5 or lower, or about 0.6 or lower.

In yet another general aspect, the invention comprises methods of producing an energy bar or food ingredient as described above or herein. In particular, the methods are an improvement or adaptation of the methods described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,773,744, which is specifically incorporated herein by reference. In one embodiment of the method to produce, or method to produce on a commercial scale or in a continuous production process, an energy bar or food ingredient having cocoa product equivalent to about 23% or more cocoa solids and about 20% total fat or less, the method comprising heating a bob syrup comprising water and sugar to a desired solids content of between about 70-85%. Alternatively, or in addition, the bob syrup component can be prepared without a heating or cooking to reduce the solids content through the use of specific ingredients. A component containing fat is added to the bob syrup or heated bob syrup and a cocoa product to a level equivalent to 20% cocoa solids or more is added. The mixture is extruded or slabbed and dried to a desired water activity level, such as below 0.6 or below 0.5. The method can further include adding a hydrocolloid to the bob syrup or heated bob syrup, such as a carrageenan or mixture of carrageenans. The sugar content is preferably limited to produce about 180 total calories or less, or 200 calories or less, per serving size.

As noted above and described in detail below, the products, bars, ingredients and/or compositions prepared as described in this disclosure and having elevated cacao product or cocoa powder levels can be used as, but are not limited to, supplements for athletic performance enhancement, mental energy or cognitive focus enhancement, and/or nutritional benefit.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an oral care instrument with at least one oral care agent that can be delivered within the mouth of a user to provide the user with enhanced oral heath. The present invention also pertains to such an oral care instrument including a wear indicator that informs the user when the oral care agent has been depleted.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

People exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. As a result, decreasing the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth has long been the target of persons working in the oral health care field.

The most common way of minimizing the harmful bacteria within the mouth is brushing with a dentifrice that delivers at least one oral care agent into the mouth. Orally introduced liquids, including oral rinses, are also utilized to provide additional oral care beyond that achieved while brushing. Mouthwashes may also be used to deliver breath freshening agents within the mouth in an attempt to eliminate bad breath.

Unfortunately, people do not always have the time to provide themselves with adequate oral care. For example, a busy person may not have the time or patience to brush thoroughly, floss and/or use an oral rinse. Alternatively, certain people may consider anything more than brushing their teeth to be unnecessary. For either reason, these people may leave a significant amount of harmful bacteria within their mouths after completing their oral care routines, which can begin to attack the teeth and gums.

Additionally, even when all available and recommended products are used, they may not be as effective as they could be if delivered simultaneously. For example, using a dentifrice and an oral rinse at different times may diminish any synergistic effect that they could provide to the user when used simultaneously.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An aspect of the present invention pertains to an oral care instrument that includes and delivers an oral care agent within the mouth of a user. The oral care instrument includes a head having at least a portion formed of a material that defines cavities. At least one oral care agent is provided in a plurality of the cavities and dispensed within the mouth of a user when the oral care agent(s) contact a fluid or chemical within the oral cavity. In another aspect of the present invention, the oral care instrument includes a wear indicator for indicating the amount of oral care agent.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to an oral care device formed of a polymer that receives at least one oral care agent. The oral care agent(s) can be included in or on one or more surfaces of the oral care instrument for delivery into the oral cavity. The oral care agent(s) can be contained within cavities in one or more surfaces of a head. Alternatively, the oral care agent(s) can be formed into, or carried by, a thin slab subsequently bonded onto the toothbrush head; or applied onto the toothbrush head as a stable coating. The oral care agents can be released during one use, during multiple uses, or throughout the life of the instrument. Water, oral secretions and/or chemicals within the mouth can activate the oral care agents.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached. The cleaning elements of these toothbrushes are configured for cleaning and/or for polishing a user's teeth, but are not configured for effective cleaning of soft tissue in a user's mouth, such as the user's tongue.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a flexible support on the head and are outwardly movable from the head. The cleaning elements may include a column-shaped central bristle at the central portion of the flexible support, and may further include a row of first cleaning elements traversing a central region of the flexible support. The oral care implement may further include a soft tissue cleanser on the head, which may be disposed on an opposite face from the cleaning elements. The soft tissue cleanser may include a ring of projections.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleanser in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof. These and other aspects are discussed in relation to the following figures.

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements including bristles and wall-like elements and being movable in the outward direction from the head; wherein the cleaning elements comprise a row of first cleaning elements substantially aligned along a longitudinal axis of the head and traversing a central region of the flexible support; and wherein some of the wall-like cleaning elements laterally radiate from the central region of the flexible support.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements comprising: a plurality of central cleaning elements disposed substantially along a longitudinal axis of the head; and for each central cleaning element, a plurality of wall-like cleaning elements that radiate from the central cleaning element to form a star configuration.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements comprising: a plurality of central cleaning elements disposed in a first row substantially along a longitudinal axis of the head; a plurality of transverse cleaning element disposed in a second row along a transverse axis that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis; and wherein the central cleaning elements and the transverse cleaning elements intersect in a central region of the flexible support to form a cross-shape.

"BACKGROUND

Perfume is an important component of modern fabric softeners, particularly those delivered through the rinse cycle of a washing machine and those present in dryer sheets and other forms. It is estimated that the cost of perfume may represent about 50% of the overall formula cost of a typical rinse cycle fabric softener. However, there is often a high volume of wasted perfume in the laundry process; instrumental measurements have indicated that about 50 to 70% of the perfume ingredients in a commercial liquid fabric softener typically remain in the washing liquor, and thus are never deposited on the fabrics being treated.

Consequently, increasing perfume deposition efficiency onto fabrics is desirable because it may allow for a significant decrease in waste and cost of a commercial fabric softening product. Furthermore, by improving the deposition efficiency of the volatile ingredients in a perfume, new perfume notes can be introduced into fabric softening compositions and more effectively deposited onto treated fabrics.

In laundry products such as fabric softeners, the presence of a perfume is intended to make the compositions more aesthetically pleasing to consumers. Apart from the point of purchase perception, the perfume additives may impart a pleasant and longer lasting fragrance to fabrics that are treated therewith. However, as noted above, with regard to liquid fabric softening compositions that are added during the laundry process, the major portion of the perfume is often lost in the wash solution during the wash and therefore wasted.

Attempts have been made in the art to increase the efficiency and deposition of perfumes on fabrics. For example, the use of cross-linked cationic vinyl polymers has been discussed and explored in conjunction with fabric conditioning formulations and personal care compositions as a thickening agent, for example in International Patent Publication No. WO 90/12862 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,345. Various methods for achieving controlled active release have been developed. One of the simplest of such embodiments is described in Canadian Patent No. 1,111,616 to Young, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,792 to Shefer et al., which describe incorporation of perfumes into wax. U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,271 describes encapsulation technology for entrapping softener compositions and fragrance oils in solid particles. An example of such microencapsulation technology is embodied in capsules with perfume, which are broken under friction to provide an instant “burst” of fragrance when the capsules are ruptured.

These types of capsules may behave differently depending on the compositions with which they are used. In particular, they may be disadvantageous in that they can often leak in aqueous compositions containing high levels of surfactants and lower alcohols. As it is desirable to provide perfumed articles that are stable in fluid compositions but still liberate perfume during use, different approaches have been used; for example, building a coating around the particles as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,646, or encapsulating perfume materials together with high C log P solvents to enable the fragrances to remain in the capsules for extended times without leaching from the capsules, as described in European Patent Publication No. 1 533 364 A3. However, there is an ongoing need for the improvement of perfume efficiency and deposition on fabrics and the capture of the more volatile ingredients of a perfume for fabric deposition.

The present invention is directed, in certain embodiments, to a cross-linked polymeric material designed as a perfume “sponge” to retain volatile perfume ingredients. In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a polymeric material capable of increasing the efficiency of perfume deposition on fabrics such as cotton when used in conjunction with a rinse cycle fabric softening composition.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

One of the complaints that consumers have regarding the brushing of teeth is the difficulty in washing away the residue of toothpaste and water left from a brushing and over time the ability to maintain a clean toothbrush. Part of the problem in washing away this residue is that the bristle carrier has been either a solid piece of plastic with blind holes or a solid piece of plastic in which bristles have either been embedded through a fusion process or through a molding process. In any case, it is quite likely that some of this residue will continue to reside on the bristle carrier around the bristles or bristle tufts as surface tension between the residue, and the material of the bristle carrier will cause residue to linger on the surface despite the user's best efforts.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,836,036 discloses a self-cleaning toothbrush wherein the head is provided with a series of intersecting support rails defining a grid pattern having the same thickness as the peripheral portion of the head. Open areas are created in the grid pattern which are overall greater than the corresponding bristle bunches to enhance the cleaning action when the head is placed under running tap water. The head including the grid pattern is of uniform thickness.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,088,870 shows a toothbrush with flexibly mounted bristles in a lattice or open network disposed against an otherwise imperforate base portion of the head. Thus, the head does not have through holes.

It would be desirable to provide a toothbrush which overcomes the problems relating to being able to maintain the toothbrush clean.

It would also be desirable if techniques could be used for effectively mounting the bristles to the carrier or head.

Various techniques have been disclosed in the prior art utilizing laser radiation and other techniques in the manufacture of toothbrushes. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,592,594 and 4,762,373, for example, disclose rounding the bristle tips by the action of laser radiation. U.S. Pat. No. 5,306,143 discloses incorporating a laser device in the handle and a lens in the head as part of an optical system. Other patents disclosing various heat application techniques and related technology are U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,132,449, 4,390,384, 4,869,277, 4,979,782, 5,052,419, 5,390,984, 5,044,041, 5,143,425, 5,407,254, 5,472,263 and 5,673,454. In addition, reference is made to PCT/EP97/00825 (WO 97/30611), EP0124937 and EP0150785.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a toothbrush which minimizes problems relating to maintaining the toothbrush clean.

A further object of this invention is to provide techniques for mounting the bristles or other cleaning elements to the carrier or head of the toothbrush.

In accordance with this invention the head of the toothbrush includes a cleaning element carrier which is in the form of a peripheral frame having an open central area. The cleaning elements are secured to and extend outwardly from support members which are mounted to the frame at joints, such as slots or other openings in the frame. The support members extend across the open area of the frame in an open lattice type pattern having through holes over the open area to facilitate the cleaning of the toothbrush head.

The support members may be in the form of thin thermoplastic plates made from the same or similar material as the bristles. The bristles are secured to the plates by laser welding. This is accomplished by having a portion of the plate/bristle unit transparent to laser light wavelength while another portion is laser beam absorbing. The plates may then be secured at the joints on the frame in any suitable manner such as through a mechanical fit or through the use of various adhesives. A further manner of securement could be through welding including laser welding where the plates and frame are made of materials having similar melting temperatures.

In an alternative embodiment the support members could be base members made of the same material as the bristles such as a nylon material and could seat in arcuate openings at the joints on the frame when being stretched across the bristle carrier frame and thereby being attached on two sides.

In a preferred practice of this invention the cleaning elements are bristles which have their cleaning ends rounded.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The process of tooth decay has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Tooth decay is typically caused by a process that begins with formation of plaque, which contains acid-secreting bacteria that etch and erode the tooth surface and otherwise irritate or attack the gingival and soft dental tissue surfaces. Plaque formation begins minutes after tooth brushing or professional tooth cleaning, with bacterial attachment taking place within a few hours thereafter.

Regular, repeated plaque removal is the main route by which tooth decay is kept in abeyance, although professionally-applied, solid polymeric sealants have been utilized as replaceable protective coatings to prevent direct contact of plaque bacteria and their acids with the tooth surface. Anti-bacterial agents have also been included in dental treatment compositions both to kill oral bacteria and, in some cases, to provide a temporary residual effect against bacterial propagation in the plaque layer formed after toothbrushing with the composition.

However, it would be desirable to provide an efficient strategy to prevent or inhibit bacterial attachment to tooth and oral soft tissue surfaces, without the need to seal the tooth in a contiguous polymer layer, and without the need to involve intervention of a dental professional.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides particles that disrupt and/or impede the attachment of bacteria to an oral surface and compositions containing the particle. The particle includes (i) a core that has an oxide compound or salt and (ii) a bioadhesive polymer. The bioadhesive polymer is attached to the oxide compound or salt. Also provided are processes for preparing the particle, methods for inhibiting or reducing the formation of plaque on an oral surface using the particle, and other related methods.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders that are the result of complex interactions between periodontopathogens and the host's immune response. It is believed that there are two interrelated aspects to the progression of periodontal disease, the first is the activation of the immune system of the host and the second is the production of oxygen radicals and their related metabolites. Increased production of oxygen radicals may contribute to oxidative stress, which is believed to be involved in periodontal disease.

Gingivitis is the inflammation or infection of the gums and the alveolar bones that support the teeth. Gingivitis is generally believed to be caused by bacteria in the mouth (particularly the bacteria instigated in plaque formation) and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. The plaque and bacterial toxins are believed to instigate oral tissue inflammation within the mouth. Periodontitis is a progressively worsened state of disease as compared to gingivitis, where the gums are inflamed and begin to recede from the teeth and pockets form in the recession, which ultimately may result in destruction of the bone and periodontal ligament. Thus, chronic infection and inflammation potentially results in the subsequent loss of teeth. Further, oral tissue inflammation can be caused by surgery, localized injury, trauma, or necrosis, or various systemic origins.

It is generally believed that the cellular components implicated by these diseases and conditions include epithelial tissue, gingival fibroblasts, and circulating leukocytes, all of which contribute to the host response to pathogenic factors generated by the bacteria. Thus, bacterial infection of the oral tissue ramps up the host's immune response and diminishes the healing process by generating free radical species (reactive oxygen species) and up-regulating inflammatory mediators that cause significant tissue damage.

Free radicals are atoms, ions, or molecules that contain an unpaired electron, and as such are usually unstable and exhibit short half-lives. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products produced during various biochemical processes, and include superoxide anions (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH−), and non-radical oxidants such as singlet oxygen (1O2). The formation of ROS can occur as part of many cellular processes including mitochondrial respiration, immune cell responses, cell injury, heat, radiation of many origins, from metabolism of drugs and other chemicals. The ROS are highly reactive and modify important cellular macromolecules. ROS initiate or accelerate disease processes.

In one example, ROS are generated during inflammation by phagocytic leukocytes, such as activated neutrophils that produce an “oxidative burst” of superoxide radicals, which are believed to be an essential factor in producing the cytotoxic effect of activated neutrophils. Moreover, superoxide may be produced physiologically by endothelial cells for reaction with nitric oxide, a physiological regulator, forming peroxynitrite, ONOO−which may decay and give rise to hydroxyl radical, OH. Additional sources of oxyradicals are “leakage” of electrons from disrupted mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticular electron transport chains, prostaglandin synthesis, oxidation of catecholamines, and platelet activation.

ROS are thought to be involved in almost all disease processes and the ageing process. Increased ROS formation under pathological conditions is believed to cause cellular damage through the action of these highly reactive molecules by crosslinking proteins, mutagenizing DNA, and peroxidizing lipids.

Another aspect of the immune response is the production of various intra and inter-cellular mediators of inflammation. One class of mediators extensively studied for their effect on the inflammatory response are the arachidonic acid metabolites namely prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that are produced through the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzyme pathways. These metabolites have been implicated as the prime mediators in gingivitis, periodontitis, osteomyelitis and other inflammatory diseases.

It would be desirable to have a method of treating a mammalian subject having infection, inflammation, and potential cellular damage in oral tissue, by killing the etiological pathogens of infection, reducing the production of one or more mediators of inflammation, and reducing free radical reactive oxygen species to reduce cellular damage to the oral tissue to promote healing.

"BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention is directed to a chewing gum which provides instantaneous cooling and immediate intense sweetness and a process of making that composition. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a chewing gum which includes a solid whose surface is sanded with crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution.

2. Background of the Prior Art

One of the sweeteners employed in the manufacture of chewing gums is xylitol. Xylitol, although a non-cariogenic sweetener, leaves little unfavorable aftertaste and simulates the texture and chewing characteristics of conventional cariogenic chewing gums. As taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,899,593 and 3,914,434, xylitol not only possesses non-cariogenic properties but has substantially the same sweetening power as conventional cariogenic-producing sugars. Moreover, xylitol is highly soluble in water and possesses a relatively large negative heat of solution and is thus capable of producing significant cooling effects in the mouth.

A recent development in the chewing gum arts has been the development of chewing gums which impart intense cooling flavor upon initial contact in the mouth. To effectuate this feeling compounds well known for their physiological cooling effect on the skin and the mucous membranes of the mouth have been employed in such chewing gums. A particularly favored compound in this application is menthol. Menthol and other like materials, although imparting cooling effect to the mouth, also emit very strong undesirable odor and bitter taste. This is caused by the high volatility of menthol and like additives.

The above remarks establish a need in the art for a sweetener which provides the advantages of strong sweetening effects, the absence of exposure to cariogenic agents and, most importantly, high intense cooling effect without attendant undesirable odor and flavor.

Sweetening agents are employed in confectioneries, including chewing gums, as internal components. Sweetening agents, however, have also been employed as surface additives to confectionaries. Molded jellies and pastries are often “sanded” with sugars. Sugar sanding of these confectioneries provide an attractive appearance, keep molded pieces from sticking together during production and enhance initial sweetness.

Sanding of chewing gums, however, has not been practiced in the prior art. This is not to say that sugar coating of chewing gums is unknown in the art. “Dusting” of chewing gum has been practiced in the past. Sanding and dusting are distinguished processes in the confectionary arts. Dusting is defined as the application of a uniform coating of fine powder particles to a surface, such as the surface of a chewing gum stick. Sanding, on the other hand, involves the embedding of solid crystals below the surface of the confectionary, such as a chewing gum solid. Sanding, by definition, consists of making fine sugar crystals which adhere to the surfaces of the products by moistening them beforehand using techniques known in the art, such as by applying dry steam, or a hot solution of gum arabic or maltodextrin to the surface, and then subsequently drying the products.

Whereas dusting provides a uniform height of fine particles, sanding, involving as it does random penetration of the surface, results in contact with solid particles of varying height and thus different concentration of the particles.

Not only has there not been any sanding of chewing gum in the prior art; indeed, there has never been sugar alcohol sanding of any confectionary in the prior art. Although the inventors can only speculate as to the reason for this absence, they believe it is because sugar alcohols have a high degree of hydroscopicity.

Another distinction between dusting and sanding is that dusted particles are far smaller, resulting in higher surface areas per unit volume than the larger particles employed in sanding. This results in shorter duration of the effect of dusted particles than sanded particles.

The above remarks establish the need in the art for a sanded chewing gum, providing intense initial cooling accompanied by corresponding intense flavor provided by intense sweeteners.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A new chewing gum has now been developed which provides immediate and intense cooling and flavor effects. This chewing gum, moreover, overcomes a barrier to its use which has discouraged its earlier development.

In accordance with the present invention a chewing gum is provided. The chewing gum includes a solid which includes a chewing gum composition coated with wetting syrup and sanded with crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution.

In further accordance with the present invention a process is provided for preparing a sanded chewing gum. In this process a solid chewing gum composition is prepared by combining gum base and a sweetening agent. A wetting syrup which includes a tackifying agent, is applied to the solid chewing gum composition. Crystals of a sugar alcohol having a negative heat of solution are applied to the wetting syrup-coated solid chewing gum composition. The surface of the sanded chewing gum solid is dried to produce the final sanded chewing gum.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to an oral care composition which contains a cationic antibacterial compound which composition is effective in retarding bacterial plaque accumulation on teeth and more particularly to a dentifrice composition containing a cationic antibacterial compound and a proteolytic enzyme which achieves plaque reduction with superior breath freshening characteristics.

2. The Prior Art

Halitosis, the technical term for bad breath, or Fetor ex Otis, is an undesirable condition. As a matter of fact, everyone, excluding the very young, occasionally has bad breath, with approximately 25% suffering on a regular basis and the problem tends to get worse and more frequent as one gets older. The problem seems to be evenly split between men and women. Bad breath results when proteins from the food we eat and saliva debris are broken down by bacteria. Even the cleanest mouth hosts millions of bacteria which have the potential to decompose these protein-containing particles left in the mouth. The tongue, with its fissures and large, bumpy surface area, retains considerable quantities of food and debris that support and protect a large bacterial population. Under low oxygen condition, this bacterial population forms foul smelling products, called volatile sulfur compounds (VSC)—such as hydrogen sulfide (“rotten eggs”) and methyl mercaptans (“skunk smell”) and other odorous and bad tasting compounds. Up to 80-90% of bad breath that originates in the mouth is by this mechanism.

Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on teeth and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity, e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like. Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

Bacteria thrive on the tongue. For the most part, the bacteria are a part of a protective bio-film that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.

A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. For example, cationic antibacterial compounds such as cetyl pyridinium chloride are well known to the art for their antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity.

In spite of the extensive prior art relating to antibacterial dentifrice compositions, there is still a need in the art to formulate a dentifrice product capable of delivering an antibacterial agent having enhanced effect in the retardation of bacterial plaque accumulation on teeth, as well as on the tongue, without inhibiting the bioavailability of the antibacterial compound. The delivery of the antibacterial compound to the tongue will allow for effective control of bad breath.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention encompasses a dental composition containing in an orally acceptable vehicle a combination of an antibacterial compound, and a proteolytic enzyme whereby superior reduction of plaque accumulation is accompanied by enhanced malodor reduction.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

In the practice of the present invention the dental composition containing the antibacterial agent and enzyme ingredients is formulated as a paste using a vehicle containing a safe and effective amount of the antibacterial and enzyme compounds.

Cationic antibacterial agents useful in the practice of the present invention are well known in the art and include both nonionic and cationic agents. See, for instance the section on “Quaternary Ammonium and Related Compounds” in the article on “Antiseptics and Disinfectants” in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 2ndedition (vol. 2, pp. 632-635), incorporated herein by reference. Cationic antibacterial compounds which possess antibacterial activity (i.e., are germicides) are used against bacteria and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formation caused by bacteria in the oral cavity.

Among the most common of these cationic antibacterial antiplaque quaternary ammonium compounds is benzethonium chloride, or diisobutylphenoxyethoxyethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride, and cetyl pyridinium chloride. In a dentifrice preparation this material is highly effective in promoting oral hygiene by reducing the formation of dental plaque and calculus, which is generally accompanied by a reduction in periodontal diseases.

Other cationic antibacterial quaternary ammonium compounds useful in the practice of the present invention include those in which one or two of the substituents on the quaternary nitrogen has a carbon chain length (typically alkyl group) of some 8 to 20, typically 10 to 18, carbon atoms while the remaining substituents have a lower number of carbon atoms (typically alkyl or benzyl group), such as 1 to 7 carbon atoms, typically methyl or ethyl groups. Dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide, benzyl dimethyl stearyl ammonium chloride, cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) and quaternized 5-amino-1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-5-methyl hexa hydro-pyrimidine are typical quaternary ammonium antibacterial agents.

The antibacterial agent is included in the dentifrice at a concentration of about 0.10 to about 1.5% by weight and preferably about 0.3 to about 1.2% by weight.

Abrasives

Abrasives preferred for use the practice of the present invention include silica materials and particularly silica gels and precipitated amorphous silica having an oil absorption value of less than 100 cc/100 g silica and preferably in the range of from about 45 cc/100 g to less than about 70 cc/100 g silica. These silicas are colloidal particles having an average particle size ranging from about 3 microns to about 12 microns, and more preferably between about 5 to about 10 microns and a pH range from 4 to 10 preferably 6 to 9 when measured as a 5% by weight slurry.

Oil absorption values are measured using the ASTM Rub-Out Method D281. The low oil absorption silica abrasive is present in the oral are compositions of the present invention at a concentration of about 5 to about 40% by weight and preferably about 10 to about 30% by weight.

Low oil absorption silica abrasives particularly useful in the practice of the present invention are marketed under the trade designation Sylodent XWA by Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace & Co., Baltimore, Md. 21203. Sylodent 650 XWA, a silica hydrogel composed of particles of colloidal silica having a water content of 29% by weight averaging from about 7 to about 10 microns in diameter, and an oil absorption of less than 70 cc/100 g of silica is a preferred example of a low oil absorption silica abrasive useful in the practice of the present invention.

Another low oil absorption silica abrasive particularly useful in the practice of the present invention is marketed under the trade designation DP-105 by J.M. Huber Chemicals Division, Havre de Grace, Md. 21078 is a precipitated amorphous silica having an average particle size distribution from 5 to 12 microns and an oil absorption in the range of 50 to 70 cc/100 g.

Other abrasives which may be used in the practice of the present invention include precipitated silicas having a mean particle size of up to about 20 microns, such as Zeodent 115, marketed by J.M. Huber Chemicals Division, Havre de Grace, Md. 21078, or Sylodent 783 marketed by Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace & Company, sodium metaphosphate, potassium metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dihydrated dicalcium phosphate, aluminum silicate, calcined alumina, bentonite or other siliceous materials, or combinations thereof.

The abrasive materials may be used individually as the sole abrasive in preparing the dental composition of the present invention or in combination with other known dentifrice abrasives. The total quantity of abrasive present in the dentifrice compositions of the present invention is at a level of from about 5% to about 60% by weight, preferably from about 10% to about 55% by weight when the dentifrice composition is a toothpaste.

Enzymes

The enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention include protein substances within the class of proteases, which breakdown or hydrolyze proteins (proteases). These proteolytic enzymes are obtained from natural sources or by the action of microorganisms having a nitrogen source and a carbon source. Examples of proteolylic enzymes useful in the practice of the present invention include papain, bromelain, chymotrypsin, ficin and alcalase.

Papain obtained from the milky latex of the Papaya tree is the proteolytic enzyme preferred for use in the practice of the present invention and is incorporated in the oral care composition of the present invention in an amount of about 0.1 to about 10% by weight and preferably about 0.5 to about 5% by weight, such papain having an activity of 150 to 300 MCU per milligram as determined by the Milk Clot Assay Test of the Biddle Sawyer Group (see J. Biol. Chem., vol. 121, pages 737-745).

An additional enzyme which may be formulated in combination with a protease enzyme such as papain is glucoamylase. Glucoamylase is a saccharifying glucoamylase ofAspergillus nigerorigin cultivated by fermentation. This enzyme can hydrolyze both the alpha-D-1,6 glucosidic branch points and the alpha-1,4 glucosidic bonds of glucosyl oligosaccharides. The product of this invention comprises about 0.001 to 2% of the carbohydrase and preferably about 0.01 to 0.55% by weight. Additional carbohydrases useful in accordance with this invention are glucoamylase, alpha and beta-amylase, dextranase and mutanase.

Other enzymes which may be used in the practice of the present invention include other carbohydrases such as alpha-amylase, beta-amylase, dextranase and mutanase and lipases such as plant lipase, gastric lipase, pancreatic lipase, pectinase, tannase lysozyme and serine proteases.

The lipase enzyme is derived from a select strain ofAspergillus niger, exhibiting random cleaving of the 1,3 positions of fats and oils. The enzyme has maximum lipolytic activity at pH 5.0 to 7.0 when assayed with olive oil. The enzyme has a measured activity of 120,000 lipase units per gram. The lipase may be included in the dentifrice composition at a concentration of about 0.010 to about 5.0% by weight and preferably about 0.02 to about 0.10% by weight.

The presence of tannase enzyme can be further beneficial in facilitating the breakdown of extrinsic stain. Tannase enzymes have been purified fromAspergillus nigerandAspergillus allianceusand are useful in the hydrolysis of tannins, known to discolor the tooth surface.

Other suitable enzymes which can comprise the present invention include lysozyme, derived from egg white, which contains a single polypeptide chain crosslinked by four disulfide bonds having a molecular weight of 14,600 daltons. The enzyme can exhibit antibacterial properties by facilitating the hydrolysis of bacterial cell walls cleaving the glycosidic bond between carbon number 1 of N-acetylmuramic acid and carbon number 4 of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which in vivo, these two carbohydrates are polymerized to form the cell wall polysaccharide. Additionally, pectinase, an enzyme that is present in most plants facilitates the hydrolysis of the polysaccharide pectin into sugars and galacturonic acid.

Dentifrice Vehicle

The orally-acceptable dentifrice vehicle used to prepare the dentifrice composition comprises a water-phase, containing a humectant therein. The humectant is preferably glycerin, sorbitol, xylitol, and/or propylene glycol of molecular weight in the range of 200 to 1,000; but, other humectants and mixtures thereof may also be employed. The humectant concentration typically totals about 5 to about 70% by weight of the oral composition.

Reference hereto to sorbitol refers to the material typically commercially available as a 70% aqueous solution. Water is present typically in amount of at least about 10% by weight, and generally about 15 to 30% by weight of the oral composition. Water employed in the preparation of commercially suitable toothpastes should preferably be deionized and free of organic impurities. These amounts of water include the free water which is added plus that which is introduced with other materials such as with sorbitol.

The dentifrice compositions of the present invention can contain a variety of optional dentifrice ingredients. As described below, such optional ingredients can include, but are not limited to, thickening agents, surfactants, a source of fluoride ions, a synthetic anionic polycarboxylate, a flavoring agent, antitartar and coloring agents.

Thickening Agents

Thickeners used in the compositions of the present invention include natural and synthetic gums and colloids. Not all naturally occurring polymer thickeners (such as cellulose or carrageenans) are compatible with dentifrice ingredients (specifically enzymes) of dentifrice compositions when formulated in the presence of proteolytic enzymes. Thickeners compatible with proteolytic enzymes include xanthan gum, polyglycols of varying molecular weights sold under the tradename Polyox, and polyvinylpyrrolidone. Compatible inorganic thickeners include amorphous silica compounds which function as thickening agents and include colloidal silicas compounds available under the trade designation Cab-o-sil manufactured by Cabot Corporation and distributed by Lenape Chemical, Bound Brook, N.J.; Zeodent 165 from J.M. Huber Chemicals Division, Havre de Grace, Md. 21078; and Sylodent 15, available from Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace Corporation, Baltimore, Md. 21203. Other inorganic thickeners include natural and synthetic clays, lithium magnesium silicate (laponite)and magnesium aluminum silicate (Veegum).

The thickening agent is present in the dentifrice composition in amounts of about 0.1 to about 10% by weight, preferably about 0.5 to about 4.0% by weight.

Surfactants

Surfactants are used in the compositions of the present invention to achieve increased prophylactic action and render the dentifrice compositions more cosmetically acceptable. The surfactant is preferably a detersive material which imparts to the composition detersive and foaming properties.

Anionic surfactants such as higher alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate are not compatible with enzymes. Anionic surfactants facilitate denaturing of the enzyme and loss in activity. As a result, it is important to the practice of the present invention to use a surfactant or combination of surfactants that are compatible with the enzymes present in the toothpaste formulation and provide the requisite foaming characteristics. Examples of enzyme compatible surfactants include nonanionic polyoxyethylene surfactants such as Polyoxamer 407, Steareth 30, Polysorbate 20, and amphoteric surfactants such as cocamidopropyl betaine and cocamidopropyl betaine lauryl glucoside. Preferred surfactants include a combination of Pluronic F127, Polyoxamer 407, Polysorbate 20, and cocamidopropyl betaine at a total surfactant concentration in the dentifrice composition of between about 2 to about 10% by weight and preferably between about 3.5 to about 6.5% by weight at weight ratios of 2.5 Polyaxomer 407, 3.3 Polysorbate-20 and 1.0 cocamidopropyl betaine.

Fluoride

The dentifrice composition of the present invention may also contain a source of fluoride ions or fluorine-providing component, as anticaries agent in amount sufficient to supply about 25 ppm to 5,000 ppm of fluoride ions and include inorganic fluoride salts, such as soluble alkali metal salts. For example, preferred fluoride sources which are compatible with enzymes present in the composition are sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, sodium fluorosilicate, ammonium fluorosilicate, as well as tin fluorides, such as stannous fluoride and stannous chloride. Sodium fluoride is preferred.

Antitartar Agents

In addition to fluoride compounds, there may also be included antitartar agents such as pyrophosphate salts including dialkali or tetraalkali metal pyrophosphate salts such as Na4P2O7, K4P2O7, Na2K2P2O7, Na2H2P2O7and K2H2P2O7long chain polyphosphates such as sodium hexametaphosphate and cyclic phosphates such as sodium trimetaphosphate. These antitartar agents are included in the dentifrice composition at a concentration of about 1 to about 5% by weight.

Enzyme Stabilizing Agents

The dentifrice composition of the present invention may also contain ingredients which stabilize enzymes in a dentifrice environment. These stabilizers protect the enzyme from inactivation by chelating metal impurities present in the dentifrice composition which have the propensity to denature the active site of the enzyme by protecting the enzyme from oxidation. Chelating agents include, ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium gluconate at concentrations between 0.01 and 1%, preferably between 0.1 and 0.5%. Agents stabilizing the enzyme against oxidation include sodium bisulfite, metal gallates, sodium stannate and ascorbic acid at concentrations between about 0.03 and about 2.0%, preferably between about 0.1 and about 0.75%.

Anionic Polycarboxylate

Synthetic anionic polycarboxylates may also be used in the dentifrice compositions of the present invention as an efficacy enhancing agent for any antibacterial, antitartar or other active agent within the dentifrice composition. Such anionic polycarboxylates are generally employed in the form of their free acids or preferably partially or more preferably fully neutralized water soluble alkali metal (e.g. potassium and preferably sodium) or ammonium salts. Preferred are 1:4 to 4:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid with another polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, preferably methylvinylether/maleic anhydride having a molecular weight (M.W.) of about 30,000 to about 1,800,000 most preferably about 30,000 to about 700,000. Examples of these copolymers are available from GAF Corporation under the tradename Gantrez, e.g. AN 139 (M.W. 500,000), AN 119 (M.W. 250,000); S-97 Pharmaceutical Grade (M.W. 700,000), AN 169 (M.W. 1,200,000-1,800,000), and AN 179 (M.W. above 1,800,000); wherein the preferred copolymer is S-97 Pharmaceutical Grade (M.W. 700,000).

When present, the anionic polycarboxylate is employed in amounts effective to achieve the desired enhancement of the efficacy of any antibacterial, antitartar or other active agent within the dentifrice composition. Generally, the anionic polycarboxylates is present within the dentifrice composition from about 0.05% to about 4% by weight, preferably from about 0.5% to about 2.5% by weight.

Flavor

The dentifrice composition of the present invention may also contain a flavoring agent. Flavoring agents which are used in the practice of the present invention include essential oils as well as various flavoring aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and similar materials. Examples of the essential oils include oils of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, sassafras, clove, sage, eucalyptus, majoram, cinnamon, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. Also useful are such chemicals as menthol, carvone, and anethole. Of these, the most commonly employed are the oils of peppermint and spearmint.

The flavoring agent is incorporated in the dentifrice composition at a concentration of about 0.1 to about 5% by weight and preferably about 0.5 to about 1.5% by weight.

Other Ingredients

Various other materials may be incorporated in the dentifrice compositions of this invention, including desensitizers, such as potassium nitrate; whitening agents; preservatives; silicones; and chlorophyll compounds. These additives, when present, are incorporated in the dentifrice composition in amounts which do not substantially adversely affect the properties and characteristics desired.

Preparation of the Dentifrice

The preparation of dentifrices is well known in the art. More specifically, to prepare a dentifrice of the present invention, generally the humectants e.g. glycerin, sorbitol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol; are dispersed in the water in a conventional mixer under agitation. Into the dispersion are added the enzyme or enzymes organic thickeners, such as xanthan gum; any anionic polycarboxylate; any salts, such as sodium fluoride anticaries agents; tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium tripolyphasphate anticalculus salts and any sweeteners; the resultant mixture is agitated until a homogeneous gel phase is formed. Into the gel phase are added a pigment such as TiO2, and any acid or base required to adjust the pH. These ingredients are mixed until a homogenous phase is obtained. The mixture is then transferred to a high speed/vacuum mixer; wherein, the inorganic silica thickener, such as Zeodent 165; and surfactant ingredients are added to the mixture. The low oil absorption silica abrasive is added at this point, along with other abrasives to be used in the composition. The mixture is then mixed at high speed for from 5 to 30 minutes, under vacuum of from about 20 to 50 mm of Hg, preferably about 30 mm Hg. The resultant product is in each case a homogeneous, semi-solid, extrudable paste or gel product.

The following example further describes and demonstrates preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The example is given solely for illustration, and are not to be construed as limitation of this invention as many variations thereof are possible without departing from its spirit and scope.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular to a toothbrush for providing an interactive competition between users of toothbrushes.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, provides an entertaining and/or educational interactive competition for the user to promote oral hygiene.

The entertaining and/or educational environment can be provided by enabling a user/player to brush his teeth and interact with a computer implemented game on a toothbrush. In one embodiment, an oral care implement provides for a synergistic combination of education and entertainment for games pertaining to oral care hygiene. Indeed, an educational game directed to oral care can be more entertaining and more educational than simple instructions. This is because, in one aspect, a player is provided with an interactive reward in which the virtual elements performing the educational functions form the basis of an interactive computer game for the player/user.

According to one aspect, an oral care implement includes a plurality of lighted segments for indicating two or more oral care regions of the mouth. The oral care implement also has a processor for causing the segments to be sequentially lighted for prescribed intervals. The segments can be used to instruct a user to brush in a particular oral care region during the prescribed interval.

In another aspect, an oral care implement has a display for displaying images associated with oral care regions of the mouth, and an input device for interacting with the images. The images can be sequentially displayed to instruct the user to brush in particular oral care regions during sequential intervals. The user can interact with the images by playing a game or the like.

In another aspect, an oral care implement comprises a processor, a display, and a memory for storing instructions. When executed by the processor, the memory causes the oral care implement to sequentially display graphical objects at prescribed intervals, and enable user interaction with the graphical objects. The user can interact with the graphical objects by playing a game or the like.

In yet another aspect, an oral care implement comprises a display for displaying graphical objects associated with oral care. The graphical objects collectively define a computer implemented process for oral care gaming. The oral care implement also has an input device to allow a user to interact with the computer implemented process.

In another aspect, an oral care implement comprises a processor, a display, and a memory for storing instructions. When executed by the processor, the memory causes the oral care implement to sequentially display text at prescribed intervals and display graphical objects. The memory also enables user interaction with the graphical objects.

In accordance with another aspect, an oral care implement includes a body for gripping the implement; and the body includes at least one of a display and an audio speaker. The oral care implement is adapted to communicate with another oral care implement via a data connection for selectively activating the display or speaker.

In another aspect, an oral care implement can be equipped with features to encourage social interaction between two or more individuals that can help promote good oral care habits. By encouraging social interaction between individuals, such as children, the overall oral care experience can be made more positive. For example, two or more oral care implements can be provided with user input devices and light displays and/or audio speakers and adapted to communicate with each other to enable two or more individuals to play a game against each other.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque is a biofilm that adheres to tooth and other oral surfaces, particularly at the gingival margin. Dental plaque is cohesive and highly resistant to removal from teeth and/or oral surfaces. Dental plaque comprises glucans, which are insoluble polysaccharides that provide plaque with its cohesive properties. The bacterial enzyme glucosyltransferase converts dietary sugar into glucans. Plaque mineralizes to form a hard deposit called calculus, which becomes a local irritant for the gums, causing gingivitis.

Current treatments for removing and preventing plaque build-up include brushing the teeth with an abrasive and/or antibacterial toothpaste, flossing, and various other treatments. The effectiveness of such treatments depends on a variety of factors including the amount of plaque present. While current techniques for removing and preventing plaque buildup on the teeth and oral tissues are suitable for their intended uses, they are subject to improvement.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides oral care compositions. Embodiments include oral compositions comprising: aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamelliaand an enhancing agent.

The present invention still further provides for a method of using an oral composition for removing dental plaque and/or inhibiting deposition of dental plaque within an oral cavity. The oral composition comprises aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamelliaand an enhancing agent.

The present invention still further provides for a method for removing dental plaque and/or inhibiting deposition of dental plaque within an oral cavity of a human or other animal subject comprising topically contacting teeth of said subject with an oral composition containing aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamelliaand an enhancing agent.

The present invention also provides for an oral composition for at least one of inhibiting and removing dental plaque comprising aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamellia, an antibacterial agent, and an agent selected from the group consisting of synthetic polymeric polycarboxylate or a synthetic anionic polymeric phosphonate polymer having an average molecular weight of about from about 100 to about 1,000,000; orally acceptable surfactant, flavor oil, non-toxic alcohol, and solubilizing humectant; and mixtures thereof.

It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions known in the art, including one or more of enhancing the inhibition of bacterial film attachment to the teeth; and enhancing the removal of bacterial film from the teeth. Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant salts, such as aluminum chlorohydrex (also called aluminum chlorohydrex polymeric salts and abbreviated here as “ACH”) and aluminum zirconium glycine salts (abbreviated here as “ZAG”. “ZAG complexes” or “AZG”), are known to contain a variety of polymeric and oligomeric species with molecular weights (MW) of 100-500,000. It has been clinically shown that, in general, the smaller the species, the higher the efficacy for reducing sweat.

In an attempt to increase the quality and quantity of smaller aluminum and/or zirconium species, a number of efforts have focused on: (1) how to select the components of ACH and ZAG that affect the performance of these materials as antiperspirants; and (2) how to manipulate these components to obtain and/or maintain the presence of smaller types of these components. These attempts have included the development of analytical techniques to identify the components. Size exclusion chromatography (“SEC”) or gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”) are methods frequently used for obtaining information on polymer distribution in antiperspirant salt solutions. With appropriate chromatographic columns, generally five distinctive groups of polymer species can be detected in commercial ACH and ZAG complexes appearing in a chromatogram as peaks 1, 2, 3, 4 and a peak known as “5,6”. Peak 1 is the larger Zr species (greater than 60 Angstroms). Peaks 2 and 3 are larger aluminum species. Peak 4 is smaller aluminum species (aluminum oligomers, or small aluminum cluster) and has been correlated with enhanced efficacy for both Al and Al/Zr salts. Peak 5, 6 is the smallest aluminum species. Various analytical approaches for characterizing the peaks of ACH and various types of ZAG actives are found in “Antiperspirant Actives—Enhanced Efficacy Aluminum-Zirconium-Glycine (AZG) Salts” by Dr. Allan H. Rosenberg (Cosmetics and Toiletries Worldwide, Fondots. D.C. ed., Hartfordshire, UK: Aston Publishing Group, 1993, pages 252, 254-256).

Previously, the inventor has described an antiperspirant active compositions having SEC chromatogram exhibiting high SEC peak 4 intensity in PCT/US2007/087145 (Published as WO2009/075678) and PCT/US2008/086556 (Published as WO2009/076591), both of which are incorporated herein by reference. Described herein is a method of making the antiperspirant.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and or mechanically driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

FIG. 30schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush19010, which has a head19012and a handle19014. As shown, the head has bristles19016extending from a front face of its head platform19018. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

FIG. 31schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device19030, which is generally the same as toothbrush19010except that it includes a tongue cleaner19020on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 31, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

One embodiment of an oral care implement includes a head platform having a plurality of faces with cleaning elements extending therefrom. The oral care implement can have flexibly mounted cleaning elements extending in opposite directions. The oral care implement can include a handle and a head with tooth cleaning elements extending from fixed pods and one or more central pods suspended between the fixed pods via a bridge. The bridge may be formed from an elastomer and permit the one or more central pods to move from an initial position toward and away from the head platform during use. The one or more central pods can include first cleaning elements extending in a first direction toward the first face and second cleaning elements extending in a second direction opposite the first direction. The second cleaning elements can extend through one or more apertures in the head platform.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a device and method for generating a chemical agent in situ. In particular, the present invention relates to a device, such as a toothbrush, that generates a chemical agent in situ by applying an electrical potential across a pair of conductors in communication with an electrolytic solution.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products include a variety of chemical agents that perform a range of functions. For instance, toothpastes, mouthwashes and whiteners include chemical agents that help to clean teeth, kill bacteria, freshen breath and/or whiten teeth. These products typically cooperate with a device such as a toothbrush, an applicator device, or a tongue scraper, to perform their intended functions. In addition, chemical agents in these products may provide secondary benefits such as providing pleasing flavors or odors.

Many oral care products are configured to be multi-functional. For example, conventional toothpaste is configured to assist with multiple functions, such as cleaning teeth, fighting tartar, providing fluoride protection, freshening breath and whitening teeth. As such, the concentrations and types of chemical agents therein are limited by chemical interaction considerations and by chemical stability considerations thereof during prolonged storage.

Oral care products that are directed to whitening teeth include an oxidizing agent as the primary active ingredient, such as hydrogen peroxide. These products are formulated into liquids, pastes or gels for application to users' teeth. Upon storage, these products lose their whitening efficacy over time. In addition, these products have a brief period of efficacy when applied to the teeth in the oral cavity. For example, saliva contains high concentrations of the enzyme catalase, which on contact rapidly decomposes hydrogen peroxide into gaseous oxygen and water and so that there is only transitory contact of the peroxide whitening agent with the teeth. In addition, the low viscosities of aqueous peroxide solutions do not allow the peroxide whitening agent to remain in contact with the teeth for as long as is necessary to effect substantive whitening, because of the constant flushing effects of salivary secretions. As such, it is desirable to have high concentrations of oxidizing agents or effective oxidizing agents applied directly to teeth.

Toothbrushes are known that generate beneficial agents, including oxidizing agents when needed luring brushing. U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,251 to Joshi discloses a toothbrush that generates beneficial oral care agents within the toothbrush when needed during brushing and that delivers them to the user's teeth once they are generated. The Joshi toothbrush generates within the toothbrush handle a fluid containing an oxidizing agent, which it delivers to the toothbrush bristles. The agent is generated via an electrochemical gas-generating cell within the toothbrush handle or via a photoelectrochemical cell within the handle.

The Joshi toothbrush does not generate its beneficial agents in situ at the application site, but instead generates them internally and subsequently transfers them to the application site. The Joshi toothbrush generates its beneficial agents from an electrolyte stored within the toothbrush handle (using its electrochemical gas generator), or it generates them from a catalyst stored within the handle via the application of light from an internal light source.

Toothbrushes are also known that generate ionized molecules by applying a voltage across electrodes on a toothbrush handle in contact with a dentifrice slurry. U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,998 to Moran; U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0054321 to Moran; and U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0177107 to Moran each discloses a toothbrush that generates weak acids of fluoride via the application of an electric charge to electrodes on the toothbrush handle in contact with an aqueous dentifrice containing sodium fluoride. The Moran toothbrushes generate fluoride ions by applying a three-volt electric charge to the aqueous slurry containing sodium fluoride. It also generates diatomic oxygen and hydrogen ions via the electrolysis of water in the slurry from same electric charge. The hydrogen ions combine with the fluoride ions to produce weak acids of fluoride (HF), which reduce the amount of acid-producing bacteria in plaque. The Moran references do not disclose a toothbrush that generates oxidizing agents other than oxygen itself via the application of an electric charge to an electrolyte. Further, the Moran references disclose generating oxygen and hydrogen ions along the toothbrush handle and do not disclose generating oxidizing agents in situ at the application site within a field of cleaning elements.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a device that generates a chemical agent in situ via the application of an electrical potential across a pair of conductors in communication with an electrolytic solution. In one embodiment, the device is a toothbrush that generates chemical agents in a user's mouth by applying an electrical potential to an aqueous electrolyte, such as a toothpaste slurry, located therein. The chemical agents may include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, or other substances depending on factors such as the composition of the electrolyte and the construction of the toothbrush. The toothbrush includes a voltage source and a first set of electrodes for applying an electrical potential to the aqueous electrolyte.

In a low voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate ions from the aqueous electrolyte, such as calcium ions, hydrogen ions, hydroxide ions and fluoride ions. In a higher voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate hydrogen peroxide and ozone. In another low voltage construction, the toothbrush includes a second set of electrodes disposed about an anode of the first set of electrodes. The first and second sets of anodes cooperate to produce hydrogen, oxygen, ions, peroxides and/or ozone via the application of a low voltage to the aqueous electrolyte and to oxygen generated thereby. In a high voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate hydrogen, oxygen and ozone.

Other aspects of the present invention provide methods for generating chemical agents in situ within a field of cleaning elements of the oral care device. These and other aspects are addressed in relation to the figures and related description.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement having a supplemental feature incorporated within and/or at the back of the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristled section on a front face of the oral care implement followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums.FIG. 1schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush10, which has a head12and a handle14. As shown, the head has bristles16extending from a front face of its head platform18. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

Some toothbrushes have a tongue cleaner on a second face that is opposite to the first face. This configuration permits the user to use a single device for cleaning their teeth, as well as their tongue, by rotating the toothbrush as needed to change the active face.FIG. 2schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device30, which is generally the same as toothbrush10except that it includes a tongue cleaner20on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 2, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements that can provide multiple cleaning functions in a single device. Further, there is a need for alternative oral care implements that can simultaneously perform multiple functions and comfortably fits within a user's mouth.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition for animal dross and its method of use. More particularly, the present invention relates to a litter that agglomerates and displays a color upon being wetted.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

House-broken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added absorbent materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The dross-soiled absorbent must be regularly cleaned to maintain a hygienic environment and to thwart the emission of objectionable odors from the presence of the urine and fecal matter in the litter. Removal of fecal matter from any litter is somewhat easy as they are generally solid objects that can be physically removed from the litter. However, physical removal of the feces does not address the issues of removing liquid dross from the litter nor does it help reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Thus it can be said that the removal of the liquid dross from the litter is harder to execute.

Though the absorbent material aids in absorbing liquid dross, it does nothing to aid in the removal of the liquid dross and to identify the liquid dross in the litter. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. The homeowner then washes the litter box and refills the litter box with fresh litter box absorbent material. These activities are unpleasant, time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome. However, repeated litter box cleanings over a period of time accounts for relatively large expenditures.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost, but each suffers from the disadvantage of merely absorbing a liquid waste product and holding the product within its porous matrices, or, in the case of sand, adsorbing the liquid dross on its surface. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, has to be discarded.

Currently clumping clays and other water absorbent material are used to improve litter compositions. An improved composition for animal litters uses the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral in the montmorillonite clay family. These absorbent materials not only absorb liquid dross, but they aid in the identification of used litter from unused litter portions. These absorbent materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine thus facilitating the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter. The wetted clump has the ability to group into a size substantially larger than the individual particles comprising the litter.

Though these improved compositions have eased the owners' task of removing soiled litter portions, they are still short of addressing problems associated with the burial or splitting of the clumped dross. The buried or split clump, if not timely discovered, will emit offensive odors within a relatively short period of time. Thus when the clumped dross is buried or split the homeowner must still either patiently sift through the litter to remove the used portions or simply discard the partially soiled litter. As a result, the benefits of having a clumped litter are diminished since the removal of the clumped dross once again becomes a time-consuming as well as costly process.

The following prior art references illustrate aspects of the technology of animal litter preparation, and, in particular, disclose the use of clays in such litters.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,420 issued Aug. 11, 1987 to Stuart, discloses an animal litter composition comprising a water-absorbing polymer such as a polyacryate combined with a porous inert solid substrate such as clay.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,115 issued Mar. 19, 1991 to Hughes, discloses the use of a water swellable bentonite clay as an absorbent litter material. The clay absorbs the liquids in animal waste which on contacting the clay agglomerates it into a stable mass easily separated from the unwetted and unsoiled portion of the composition.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,532 issued Dec. 7, 1993 to Franklin, et al., discloses a pH-indicating material maintained on an inert carrier that is separate from the cat litter material. The pH-indicating material has dual indicators that provide one color transition at a low pH and a different color transition at a high pH so that acidic or alkaline animal urine problems can be visibly detected upon contact between the animal urine and the pH-indicating material.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,371,054 issued Dec. 6, 1994 to Pluta, et al., discloses an animal litter composition used to diagnose animal health problems. The composition comprises at least one uncalcined clay substrate having a calcium oxide content of less than about 5% by weight and wherein the clay mineral component of said substrate has an attapulgite content of at least about 35% by weight, in combination with at least one chemical pH indicator.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,619,233 issued Sep. 16, 2003 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,763,783 issued Jul. 20, 2004 both to Mochizuki, disclose a granulated-type, urine-discharge processing material for animals that discriminates between before-use and after-use. The material comprises a water absorbent granular body dyed with water soluble dyes or a water absorbent granular body containing powder of water soluble dyes, and a water absorbent surface layer covering a surface of the water absorbent granular body. The water absorbent surface layer and the water absorbent granular body are bonded to each other through a non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer formed of a plurality of adhesive non-coated parts and a plurality of adhesive coated parts which is coated on the surface of the water absorbent granular body. Discharged animal urine is permeated into the water absorbent granular body through the water absorbent surface layer and the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer, or by dissolving the adhesive coated parts. Thereby, the water soluble dyes are eluted into the discharged urine so that the water absorbent surface layer is dyed through the non-continuous water soluble adhesive layer. The water absorbent granular body is chiefly composed of vegetable fiber or vegetable powder and contains inorganic fillers. The water absorbent granular body further contains powder of a water absorbent polymer so that the granular body can have rich water absorbing and retaining properties. No mention is made to clays in the patent.

A need exists for a clumping litter that clumps in response to wetness and can be readily discovered and removed from the remaining dry litter when clumped and wet.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A clump recognition animal litter is disclosed that enables a user to visually identify and dispose of all used litter portions from unused litter portions regardless of clump size and clump location. The clump recognition animal litter comprises a clumping component and a color indicating material. A wetted litter clumps and displays a color in response to wetness.

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2008/065700, filed Jun. 4, 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with a customizable element. Individuals exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth or perform interdental cleaning of their teeth. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a customizable element.

In one aspect, an oral care implement, with an oral care region having cleaning elements for engaging oral tissue and a body for gripping the implement including a handle with a front and a removable faceplate is described. The removable faceplate may be transparent or translucent and may also include design features. The faceplate may provide protection to a user inscription surface on one of the surfaces of the handle which may be configured to receive user indicia that may later be removed and further indicia provide.

In another aspect, a motorized electric oral care implement, with an oral care region having cleaning elements for engaging oral tissue, a body for gripping the implement including a handle having a removable faceplate, and an electric power source, such that the faceplate is electrically coupled to the electrical power source when the faceplate is in an attached state is described. The power source powers visual and/or audio features of the faceplate providing entertainment and interest to the user.

In another aspect, a method of marketing an oral care implement and a face plate is described. For example, this method may be implemented by exposing a primary oral care implement for sale, exposing a plurality of distinct faceplates each removably attachable to the oral care implement, permitting a user to select at least one of the removable faceplates and providing the oral care implement and the selected faceplate to the user. A variety of variations are possible.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Polymeric microcapsules can be produced by one of several methods readily known in the art. Such methods include single and double emulsion solvent evaporation techniques.

Polymeric microcapsules have a wide variety of uses, such as use in drug delivery systems and personal care products, including dentifrices (i.e., a substance, such as a paste or powder, for cleaning the teeth). However, polymeric microcapsules generally do not provide good protection of an active ingredient encapsulated by the microcapsule from its external environment, such as one composed of a dentifrice formulation, while providing extended release of the active ingredient.

Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) is a cationic, surfactant-like, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that can be used for oral-care applications. However, due to its positive charge, CPC forms stable complexes with various common ingredients often used in, for example, dentifrices, such as sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), an anionic surfactant. These types of reactions preclude the use of CPC in for example, common dentifrice formulations to deliver effective antimicrobial benefits.

In dentifrice applications, in order for microcapsules to stay intact during the toothpaste making and storage process, the microcapsules should possess the following properties: 1) good mechanical properties to sustain shear forces up to about 1000/s during mixing and high speed filling; 2) good temperature stability that allow the capsules to stay intact at temperatures up to about 71° C.; 3) good chemical stability that allows the capsules to be stable in the presence of sodium lauryl sulfate having a concentration of up to about 2% and a pH of about 5-8, and various water and humectants ratios. In addition, upon brushing, the microcapsules should break and release CPC to the oral cavity directly without formation of inactive complexes.

There are a number of triggers that allow the breakage of microcapsules during brushing, such as: 1) a mechanical trigger due to the grinding and shearing of toothbrush bristles; 2) a pH trigger due to the change in pH from a dentifrice base to an oral cavity environment; 3) an osmotic trigger due to the dilution of a dentifrice by saliva in the mouth during teeth brushing; and 4) an enzymatic trigger due to the breakage of polymer bonds by enzymes in the mouth.

It has also recently been recently reported in the literature that polymer microcapsules having mucoadhesive polymers has been formed via a water-in-oil emulsion method.

Accordingly, there is still a need for polymeric microcapsules that provide good protection of the active ingredient from its external environment while providing extended release profiles of the active ingredient over a significant period of time, such as a 24 hour time period. In addition, such polymeric microcapsules used in dentifrices, should have mucoadhesive properties that allow for extended release profiles of the active ingredient over a significant time period. In particular, there is still a need for an encapsulation technology to shield active ingredients, such as CPC, from incompatible ingredients, such as SLS.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention further provides for a process for manufacturing an antimicrobial dentifrice that comprises (a) encapsulating quaternary ammonium salt within a polymeric microcapsule, and (b) admixing a dentifrice with the encapsulated quaternary ammonium salt.

Another aspect of the present invention is a method of producing quaternary ammonium salt encapsulated by a polymeric microcapsule having an average diameter of about 5 microns to about 50 microns, comprising (a) dissolving the quaternary ammonium salt in an aqueous phase, (b) dispersing the aqueous phase within a hydrophobic organic solvent having a dissolved polymer to form a solution, (c) dispersing the solution in an external aqueous phase, and (d) removing the solvent from the external aqueous phase of step (c) to form quaternary ammonium salt encapsulated polymeric microcapsules.

A further aspect of the present invention includes a method of producing quaternary ammonium salt encapsulated by a polymeric microcapsule having an average diameter of about 5 microns to about 50 microns comprising (a) dissolving a polymer and the quaternary ammonium salt in an aqueous phase, (b) dispersing the aqueous phase as water-in-oil emulsion drops, and (c) stirring the emulsion of step (b) at elevated temperatures to evaporate the aqueous phase and form quaternary ammonium salt encapsulated polymeric microcapsules.

"STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT: N/A

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to a method of using a composition and compound with antiprotozoal activity. These methods and materials will potentiate control of protozoal populations under a variety of conditions, particularly in ruminants.

The normal diet of the ruminant animal is forage. Forage includes grasses, legumes and cellulytic byproducts of agricultural production. These are either fed fresh as pasture or green chop; in a dry form as hay; or in a preserved state as silage. The ability to utilize these materials as sources of nutrients is only possible as a result of pregastric bacterial fermentation in the rumen, the nonfundic portion of the animal's stomach. Here, bacterial action reduces the complex structural carbohydrates; cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin and the associated nonstructural carbohydrates; pectin, starches and sugars, to either fatty acids or more chemically simplistic carbohydrate forms, which are then subjected to gastric action in the fundic stomach and small intestine.

The adaptation of ruminants to pregastric digestion has involved a system of retention of digesta, which is an essential part of the mechanism for maximal extraction of energy. This retention requires some sacrifices in food intake, which becomes more limited on forage based diets because the coarser ingests must be retained longer to achieve efficient extraction of energy. This poses a special problem in the modern, domesticated ruminant, in that the nutrient demands created by genetic selection for rapid lean muscle growth or high levels of milk production far exceed the supply generated by rumenal fermentation of forage based diets.

The diets that must be fed require the addition of large amounts of nonstructural carbohydrate (starches and sugars) fed in the form of grain which, unfortunately, often is a source of physiologic and metabolic stress.

These problems are associated with the changes which occur in rumenal fermentation as a result of grain ingestion. As a consequence, feeding strategies must attempt to maximize forage use while not compromising nutrient supply needed for maintenance and production.

A solution to the problem of nutrient supply and demand in the ruminant animal, as imposed by the limitations of bacterial, pregastric digestion, is to enhance the efficiency and rate at which this process occurs. The rumen is a continuous fermentation system that is provided with nutrients (feeds), buffers (salivary and other salts) and fluids (water and saliva) on both a continuous and an intermittent basis. The efficiency of this fermentation is measured through rumen turnover. Turnover is conventionally expressed as the portion of the rumen contents that leaves the rumen per hour. Liquids and solids turn over at different, but usually related, rates. Liquid flow rates, as proportions of the total liquid volume, have been found to turn over at rates that increased from <8 to 13.5%/hr as dry matter intake went from 5 to 21 kg/day (Livestock Prod. Sci.,17:37, 1987). At the same time, solids turnover increased from 3 to 5%/hr due to increased intake. In other studies, values of 17%/hr for liquids (Can. J. Ani. Sci.,64 (Supp.):80, 1984) and as high as 7.0%/hr for concentrates (J. Dairy Sci., 65:1445, 1982) were reported. In a typical ration of a dairy cow consuming >20 kg dry matter/day, representative rumen digesta passage rates would be 15%/hr for liquids, 6%/hr for grains and 4.5%/hr for forages. The rates would all decrease with a lower level of intake.

Another important rumen characteristic associated with turnover rate is microbial yield, where microbial yield is defined as the quantity of microbial mass flowing from the rumen per day. A further, and important refinement of this expression of microbial yield, which is also effected by turnover rate, is the efficiency of microbial yield. This is usually expressed as grams of microbial protein (or nitrogen) produced per kg of organic matter (OM) digested in the rumen. Both aspects of microbial production have applied significance. Microbial yield is important as an index of the amount of microbial protein available to the ruminant animal per day.

Microbial efficiency is important as part of the calculation of microbial yield where: microbial yield (gr of microbial N/day)=microbial efficiency (gr microbial N/kg digested organic matter)×kg OM digested in the rumen per day.

Because of the rapid rumen turnover rates commonly found in cattle with high dry matter intakes, such as dairy cattle, high microbial efficiencies are expected. If, however, an imbalance in the nutrients available to the rumen microbes occurs, the microbial efficiency can be impaired. This is particularly evident if ruminally available nitrogen or carbohydrate sources are inadequate.

Another factor which effects ruminal microbial efficiency and yield is predation by rumen protozoa. The rate of bacterial predation is proportional to the concentration of bacteria available. Coleman (The Roles of Protozoa and Fungi in Ruminant Digestion. Armidale, Penambul Books, 1989, p. 13) reported that when bacterial concentrations were 109/ml, a value representative of that in rumen fluid, the average uptake for 18 protozoal species was 493 bacteria/hr/protozoa; when bacteria were at the maximum density, the average uptake for the 18 species of protozoa was 3,739 bacteria/hr/protozoa. Protozoal predation involves engulfment which usually kills the bacteria. The overall effect of predation on bacterial numbers is considerable.

It has been shown that the removal of protozoa (defaunation) can result in a 2-4 fold increase in numbers of rumen bacteria. The reduction in bacterial numbers is not uniform across all species. Generally, more amylolytic than cellulolytic bacteria are engulfed. It is possible, therefore to conclude that the extent and rate of digestion of various carbohydrates differs between fuanated and defuanated animals. Protozoa also have negative effects on rumen function. Because of their sequestration on large feed particles and on the rumen wall, the flow of protozoa from the rumen is less than would be predicted from their concentration in the rumen and rate of digesta flow.

Therefore, although protozoa can represent 50% of the biomass in the rumen, they contribute 20% or less to the microbial protein flowing to the duodenum. In addition, predation on bacteria causes recycling of bacterial protein in the rumen. Protozoa engulf and kill large quantities of bacteria, assimilating much of the protein from these organisms.

Since most of the protozoa remain in the rumen until they lyse, microbial protein flow from the rumen also is reduced. In vivo measurements summarized by Jounay et al (Anim. Feed Sci. Tech. 21:229, 1988) indicate that defuanation resulted in a 36% increase in grs of microbial nitrogen flowing from the rumen per kg of organic matter fermented.

An additional negative aspect of protozoa on digestive function that is important to ruminants in general, and high producing dairy cows in particular, is their engulfment and digestion of particulate feed protein. This permits protozoa to assimilate proteins of low rumen degradability which have been added to the diet as sources of by-pass protein (Hoover et al. Rumen Digestive Physiology and Microbial Ecology, West Virginia University Bulletin 708T; p 22.).

The overall effects of the presence or absence of protozoa in ruminants are not well characterized because of the difficulty in reducing their numbers in viva. Compounds which have demonstrated defuanating activity have proven too toxic to safely feed to ruminants or ineffective when fed for prolonged periods of time. Thus although the benefits of defuanation have been conclusively demonstrated in vitro, the transferal of this information to field practice has yet to be accomplished.

OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In view of deficiencies in the art as described above and other related goals well known in the art, one object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive method of use which, when used as a component in ruminant diets, will control, reduce and prevent protozoal populations in the ruminant by promoting facultative bacterial growth.

Another object of the present invention is to provide a feed additive and method of use which allows for the control, reduction and prevention of protozoal populations and thereby allow for the maximization of ruminal microbial growth and efficiency, the benefits of which increased flow of microbial protein to the duodenum, increased ruminal fermentation efficiency, and increased dry matter intake.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a feed additive that does not have any negative effects upon the bacterial population of the rumen.

An exemplary embodiment of the invention provides a method for controlling, reducing or preventing the growth of protozoa in the rumen of a ruminant, comprising feeding an antiprotozoal amount of a composition comprising cell bodies of a facultative anaerobeCorynebacterium, orBrevibacteriumhaving antiprotozoal activity, glutamic acid fermentation solubles, or corn fermentation solubles to a ruminant, and thereby promoting facultative anaerobe growth to increase the amount of said cell bodies and the fermentation solubles including such cell bodies.

The composition and compound, when used as a feed supplement in a diet formulated for ruminant animals, will significantly reduce ruminal protozoal populations, although the use of the invention to control protozoal populations is not restricted to ruminal control alone.

The method of the present invention of ruminal protozoal control has been shown to significantly enhance feed intake and increase ruminal digestive efficiency. Simply stated, the compound of the present invention includes a combination of bacterial cell bodies, nonprotein nitrogen and amino acids dried on a carrier. In a preferred embodiment of the invention the source of the antiprotozoal compound is derived from the cell bodies of facultative bacterial species, preferably˜Corynebacterium. Another source isBrevibacterium. Preferred species arelactofermentumandglutamicum. Antiprotozoal activity is found in the isolated cell bodies themselves or in the byproduct materials derived from the fermentations driven by these bacteria in which the cell bodies may be present (fermentation solubles). Examples are glutamic acid fermentation solubles and corn fermentation solubles. In ruminant animals, the cell bodies and/or the fermentation byproducts may be fed unprocessed (undried), although maximum response is achieved when the cell bodies and/or the byproducts are dried at temperatures that do not denature the organic nitrogen components present therein. This temperature varies with the drying method used and generally ranges from not less than about 80 to not more than about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention generally relates to a control release formulation that is supplemented with a rumen-bypass protected biologically active content. More specifically, in preferred embodiments this invention relates to ruminant feedstocks for domesticated ruminants which are capable of delivering undegraded essential aminoacids such as lysine and methionine to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants such as dairy cattle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Publications cited in the present specification are incorporated by reference.

When a feedstock for ruminants has a content of biologically active constituent, a substantial amount of the said constituent (e.g., protein, aminoacids, and the like) is degraded to ammonia or carbon dioxide gas by microorganisms in the rumen. This prevents effective utilization of the administered biologically active constituent in the feedstock.

When special nutrients or medicaments are administered to ruminants, it is essential to protect these ingredients from decomposition in the rumen. The objective is to pass the said ingredients through the rumen to the omasum, and subsequently to the abomasum and absorption by the small intestine.

There are ongoing research and development activities which are seeking to achieve ruminant feedstock supplements which have the desired rumen-bypass properties. Rumen-bypass formulations are reported in numerous publications such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,842,863; 4,948,589; 5,023,091; 5,064,665; 5,093,128; 5,571,527; 5,633,004; 5,635,198; 6,203,829 and 6,306,427. There is further disclosure in WO2004/080197-A2 (PCT) and references cited therein.

Special effort has been directed to achieving rumen-bypass protection for essential aminoacids which supplement feedstocks for milk-producing ruminants.

It is known that lysine and methionine are important for milk production in dairy cattle. Journal of Dairy Science, 70, 789 (1987) reports that rumen-protected lysine increased feed intake, milk yield and 4% fat-corrected milk production in dairy cows; rumen-protected methionine and lysine increased production of milk protein in dairy cows.

Similar results are reported in Journal of Dairy Science, 72, 1484 (1989); 72, 1800 (1989); 73, 135 (1990); and 74, 2997 (1991). Data also indicated that added fat increased the percentage and yield of long-chain fatty acids in cow milk. Adding ruminally-protected aminoacids to fat-supplemented diets appeared to alleviate the milk protein depression observed with added lipids in feedstock.

Because of the significant economic consequences of rumen-bypass undegraded dietary nutrient transport, there is continuing interest in the development of superior rumen-bypass feedstock supplements to promote these prospective advantages.

Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide ruminant feedstocks which are supplemented with a rumen-protected biologically active content for advancing ruminant husbandry and for providing value added meat and dairy products for human consumption.

It is another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements to stabilize and maintain the health of ruminants, and to improve the lactational performances of dairy ruminants.

It is yet another object of this invention to provide rumen-bypass dietary supplements which deliver post-rumen undegraded aminoacids in milk-producing dairy cattle for increased milk yield and increased production of milk protein.

It is a further object of this invention to provide an efficient process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement in compacted particulate form, which supplement has the capability of passing between about 20-99 percent of its rumen-protected biologically active content to the post-rumen digestive system of ruminants.

Other objects and advantages of the present invention shall become apparent from the accompanying description and example data.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention discloses a control release formulation (e.g., a rumen-bypass dietary supplement) in compacted form. In one embodiment, the control release formulation (or supplement) has the capability to transport a fatty acid salt (e.g., a fatty acid calcium salt) and one or more rumen-protected undegraded biologically active agents (e.g., an aminoacid) to the post-ruminal digestive system of a ruminant. In accordance with the present invention, the rumen-bypass dietary supplement comprises: (a) a fatty acid salt; (b) one or more biologically active agents; (c) a free alkali metal salt and/or a free alkaline earth metal salt; and (d) a binder. In one embodiment, under ruminant feeding conditions the dietary supplement has the capability to transport between about 20-99 percent of one or more rumen-protected undegraded biologically active agents (e.g., an aminoacid) to the post-rumen digestive system of a ruminant.

In another embodiment, the present invention provides a process for producing a rumen-bypass dietary supplement comprising: (1) blending a fatty acid salt (e.g., an alkaline earth metal salt) and one or more biologically active agents to form solid central core particles; (2) compacting the core particles to form pellets; (3) optionally coating the pellets with a liquid carboxylate salt-forming fatty acid constituent and/or a liquid carboxylate salt; and (4) optionally applying one or more additional coatings to the pellets with a constituent comprising a basic inorganic alkaline earth metal compound to create an in situ reactive carboxylate salt-forming matrix.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, with an enhanced tissue cleaner. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, they have generally not been effective or easy to use. Further, many of these scrapers cannot easily be used to cleanse other tissue within the mouth. Notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by cleaning the tissue in the mouth, many users avoid the use of such cleansers due to a lack of comfort and/or ease of use. The present description seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and to provide new features heretofore not available.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a configuration of tissue cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of the tongue and other mouth tissue.

In one aspect of the invention, an oral care implement has a head connected to a handle. The head includes a tooth cleaning element region and a tissue cleaning element region. The tooth cleaning element region may include various bristle or other tooth cleaning element arrangements. The tissue cleaning element region includes a plurality of angled tissue cleaning projections. The tissue cleaning projections can be movable between a plurality of positions to provide directional cleaning.

In another aspect of the invention, the angled tissue cleaning projections can be configured on a portion of the head and another portion of the head can include a plurality of substantially rigid projections formed of a more rigid material than the angled tissue cleaning projections.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to molded polymeric containers, and more particularly to methods for making overmolded containers, which may enhance certain functionalities of the container, such as surface texture and hand feeling, coloration and other visual design variables, thermal insulation, and other functions.

Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) based polyesters have been widely used as container materials because of their good mechanical properties and barrier properties. Containers made from PET, however, typically have hard and smooth surfaces. These surfaces are difficult to grip, and containers can slip from a consumer's hand, causing the container contents to spill. This loss of grip is often exacerbated when a filled container product (e.g., a bottle containing a beverage) that has been stored at low temperature (e.g., in a refrigerator) is taken out for use at room temperature such that water condenses onto the outside of the container. It therefore would be highly desirable to improve the grippability of PET containers, as well as other thermoplastic polymeric containers, especially for product containers that frequently find use in conditions under which condensation forms on the outside of the containers. As used herein, the terms “grippable” and “grippability” refer to the characteristic of a surface of a container that one is able to hold firmly, without slipping from one's grasp.

As PET has found increasingly more applications in the beverage and consumer goods industry, brand owners are pressed to identify ways to differentiate their products, particularly through packaging innovation. Examples of innovative design features include the use of different textures on the containers and colored containers. While many of these marketing innovations may be conceptually appealing, their implementation may not be practical from a manufacturing, cost or environmental perspective, or the container may possess certain characteristics that would render the design unsuitable in other aspects. For example, colored containers can severely damage the PET recycling stream because they cannot be easily separated from the remaining PET stream. Furthermore, a textured mold is required to make a textured container. Such molds often are very expensive, and it is difficult to change the texture once the mold is created. It therefore would be desirable in the industry to be able to differentiate a PET packaged product without a detrimental impact on the PET recycling stream or an excessive cost increase.

Overmolding or multi-component molding has been widely used in the injection molding industry. Overmolding is essentially defined as a process that produces finished components with two or more thermoplastic based resins by way of injection molding. Overmolding has been used in the cable industry for many years, and has found increasing interest in the industrial and consumer goods industries. In these industries, many applications combine a soft touch material with rigid parts. The soft touch materials provide improved aesthetics, better tactile properties, and improved grippability. The most widely used method of combining a soft and rigid material is by overmolding. Traditionally, overmolding of the soft material directly onto the rigid material creates the finished product part. It would be desirable to provide a way to use soft touch materials with rigid containers, such as beverage containers.

A need therefore exists in the packaging industry to create a container that is easily colored, with controllable gripping functions, insulation functions, and/or other functions, and to achieve these design features without negatively impacting the PET or other thermoplastic recycling stream. Furthermore, there exists a need in the packaging industry to create such a container with a cost-effective process.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Methods for making an overmolded container and overmolded containers are provided. The overmolded containers advantageously may provide enhanced visual and tactile characteristics, enabling innovative packaging designs, improved grippability and thermal insulation. The methods of manufacture accomplish these container advantages in a cost effective manner, with no or minimal impacting on materials recycling streams.

In one aspect, the method of making the container includes the steps of providing preform for a container, the preform comprising a thermoplastic polymer; overmolding an elastomeric overmold material over at least a portion of the preform to form an overmolded preform; and blow-molding the overmolded preform to form an overmolded container. In a preferred embodiment, the overmolding container is a beverage container.

The preform can be made from a variety of thermoplastic polymers. In one embodiment, the thermoplastic polymer includes one or more polyesters. In a preferred embodiment, the thermoplastic polymer is or includes a polyethylene terephthalate copolymer.

The overmold material is selected to be processible at temperatures and pressures compatible with the blow molding process, so that the overmold material is able to conformingly stretch, with the preform, and take the shape of the resulting blow molded container. In one embodiment, the overmolded material comprises a thermoplastic elastomer.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides an entertaining and/or educational interactive competition using a vibratory or motion inducing device.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

A toothbrush that shows an example of brushing behavior reinforcement is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,389,633 to Rosen. A motion sensing means is used to monitor the brushing action of the user. When the logic requirements of motion sensing are complete, the logic means directs a digital output display means to output to a small LCD screen or speaker a visual and/or an audible indication to the user, such as in the form of a rudimentary game or congratulatory message.

Powered toothbrushes generally have a movable head that is motor-driven from a handle. While such toothbrushes usually achieve a more intensive cleaning action than manual toothbrushes, they may be uncomfortable for users due to transmission of motor vibrations to the hand of the user.

These problems are magnified in that adult powered toothbrushes may be uncomfortable for some users, such as children. Further, the differences in the oral cavity size and tooth configurations between children and adults make it difficult for children to use adult toothbrushes.

There remains a need for alternative techniques for promoting oral hygiene, and particularly for providing an incentive to users to brush their teeth for at least a minimum recommended brushing interval. Further, there is a need for an oral care implement ergonomically configured for children.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides an entertaining and/or educational interactive competition using a vibratory or motion inducing device.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a display and/or a plurality of other lighted regions, as well as a motor or other element for inducing motion in a head region of the implement.

In one embodiment, the motion inducing element may induce vibratory or oscillatory motion of tooth-cleaning elements (e.g., bristles) located in the head.

In one embodiment, the display and/or lights are used to provide instructions to the user regarding a periodically-performed oral care regimen.

In one embodiment, the lights and/or display are used to instruct a user to brush one portion of the user's teeth for a certain amount of time, then another portion of the user's teeth.

In one embodiment, the motion-inducing element can be pulsed or otherwise selectively activated to signal different intervals in the regimen.

In one embodiment, upon conclusion of the oral care regimen, the lights and/or display and the motion-inducing element are used to provide a game or other entertainment to the user.

In one embodiment, an ergonomic oral care implement is configured for the anatomical structures of children.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, in particular, to a toothbrush having tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser with a low profile head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. One particular spot on the tongue that harbors significant quantities of odor-causing bacteria is the back of the tongue. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor. There is also evidence supporting the breath freshening benefits of cleansing cheek surfaces to remove dead skin cells, which ultimately will settle on the tongue surface becoming a source of protein for a host of odor causing bacteria.

Consequently, tissue cleansers have been added to a face of the head of a conventional toothbrush opposite the face on which the tooth cleaning elements are positioned. Adding a tissue cleanser increases the head height of the brush. Using a conventional toothbrush having tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser to clean the back of the tongue often results in the gag reflex due to inadvertent contact with the back of the throat, due to the increased head height of the brush. This increase in head height also negatively affects the tooth cleaning efficacy of the brush, making brush head access to hard to reach areas, such as the buccal surfaces of the third molars, difficult due to restricted access between cheeks and teeth. Previous efforts seen in the art to improve oral access have typically focused on the “head size”, as evidenced by the offering of “compact”, and even “ultra-compact”head sizes. These smaller head sizes have in fact only focused on reducing the length and width of the brush head, and have ignored the overall brush head height, the primary restriction in accessing tight buccal spaces, and primary cause of the gag reflex when cleansing the back of the tongue.

It would be desirable to provide a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY

The principles of the invention may be used to advantage to provide a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser with a reduced profile. In accordance with a first aspect, a toothbrush includes a handle, and a head at an end of the handle having a thickness, a first surface, and an opposed second surface. Tooth cleaning elements extend outwardly from the first surface and have a length. A tissue cleanser is positioned on the second surface and has a height. A head height includes the thickness of the head, the length of the tooth cleaning elements, and the height of the tissue cleanser, and is less than 17.7 mm.

In accordance with another aspect, a toothbrush includes a handle and a head at an end of the handle having a thickness of approximately 3.6 mm, a first surface, and an opposed second surface. Tooth cleaning elements extend outwardly from the first surface and have a diameter of less than 7 mil (0.007″). A tissue cleanser on the second surface has a plurality of nubs and a height of approximately 0.5 mm. A head height includes the thickness of the head, the length of the tooth cleaning elements, and the height of the tissue cleanser, and is less than 17.7 mm.

Substantial advantage is achieved by providing a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser with a reduced profile. In particular, certain embodiments of a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements and a tissue cleanser with a reduced profile allow a user to more comfortably clean tissue deep in the mouth, helping to reduce the body's natural gag reflex. A further advantage is gained in tooth cleansing by providing improved access to tight buccal surfaces. A further advantage is offered in cleaning cheek surfaces opposite third molars, as the soft tissue cleanser is able to reach further into the tight pocket space between third molars and cheeks.

These and additional features and advantages disclosed here will be further understood from the following detailed disclosure of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with a liquid collection system. Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects. Dental checkups to a dentist office are typically the only feedback a person receives on their dental cleaning efforts. There is unfortunately plenty of time in between checkups for poor dental habits to cause problems. For example, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and a host of other problems can be magnified if dental cleaning habits are not rectified promptly.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a collection system of oral fluids.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having an oral member having a thickness that is reduced or shortened during use; a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; a receiver fluidly coupled to the oral member for receiving an oral fluid; and a fluid pathway in communication with the receiver to provide the oral fluid to the reservoir. In one possible embodiment, the oral member may be made of a conventional hydrogel material that may swell during use.

In another aspect, an oral care implement includes a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; and a multilayer collection member including a layer that wears away during use so as to expose an indicium layer that indicates when the reservoir should be provided for analysis of the collected oral fluid.

In yet another aspect, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir for storing an oral fluid. A capillary channel constructed from a fibrous material, ceramic, porous plastic, or combination thereof extends through at least a portion of the implement to receive the oral fluid from one or more inlets.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to a device for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid using a lateral flow test cell that exhibits improved detection.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid. Preferably, the gold colloid has a mean particle size of about 60 nm to about 80 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention preferably comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate. In specific embodiments, the biphasic substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material.

In a preferred embodiment, the release medium comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a label and a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte. The release medium further comprises a capturable conjugate comprising a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte and a capturable component, such as biotin. Accordingly, in diagnostic tests wherein a liquid sample for testing includes the analyte to be detected, the analyte produces a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

The capture medium preferentially comprises a capture site that includes a capture component for capturing the complex described above. In a specific embodiment, the capture site has immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

The invention is particularly characterized in that multiple aspects of the invention can be combined to provide a diagnostic device including multiple elements useful for providing improved test results, particularly improved accuracy, improved ability to detect low levels of test analyte, and overall improved test results. Preferentially, the invention combines an enhanced label component with an enhanced capture component to improve the overall efficiency of the inventive diagnostic device, particularly in relation to the sensitivity of the diagnostic device.

In one embodiment, the invention comprises a device for detecting an analyte, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate, which comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material. The release medium preferably comprises both a labeled conjugate and a capturable conjugate. The labeled conjugate comprises a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid having a mean particle size of about 50 nm to about 100 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The capturable conjugate comprises a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, the analyte produces a complex comprising the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate. The capture medium preferably comprises a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

In another aspect, the present invention provides various methods for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample. In one embodiment, the method comprises providing a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device. Preferably the device comprises a biphasic substrate comprising a release medium and a capture medium. The release medium is generally formed of a first material and comprises a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising colloidal gold particles having a mean particle size of at least about 50 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The release medium further comprises a capturable conjugate comprising a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a complex is formed comprising the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate. The capture medium is in fluid communication with the release medium and is typically formed of a second, different material, the capture medium comprising a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin. In preferred embodiments, the method further comprises adding a liquid sample to the first portion of the device and allowing the liquid sample to flow across the release medium and the capture medium. According to the method, the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample is determined by visual inspection of the capture medium, wherein the presence of the analyte is indicated by the presence of color development at the capture site caused by the binding of the streptavidin capture component with the complex formed of the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

In another embodiment, the method of the invention comprises providing an analyte detection device comprising a substrate with a first portion comprising colloidal gold having a mean particle size of 50 nm to 100 nm releasably immobilized thereon and a second portion in fluid communication with the first portion and comprising a capture component immobilized thereon. The method further comprises adding a liquid sample to the first portion of the device, allowing the liquid sample to flow across the first portion and the second portion of the substrate, and determining the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample by visual inspection of the second portion of the substrate. Preferably, the presence of the analyte is indicated by the presence of color development in the area wherein the capture component is immobilized caused by accumulation of the colloidal gold.

In further embodiments, the method of the invention is specifically directed to the detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The process of tooth decay has been the subject of intense scrutiny. Tooth decay is typically caused by a process that begins with formation of plaque, which contains acid-secreting bacteria that etch and erode the tooth surface and otherwise irritate or attack the gingival and soft dental tissue surfaces. Plaque formation begins minutes after tooth brushing or professional tooth cleaning, with bacterial attachment taking place within a few hours thereafter.

Regular, repeated plaque removal is the main route by which tooth decay is kept in abeyance, although professionally-applied, solid polymeric sealants have been utilized as replaceable protective coatings to prevent direct contact of plaque bacteria and their acids with the tooth surface. Anti-bacterial agents have also been included in dental treatment compositions both to kill oral bacteria and, in some cases, to provide a temporary residual effect against bacterial propagation in the plaque layer formed after toothbrushing with the composition.

However, it would be desirable to provide an efficient strategy to prevent or inhibit bacterial attachment to tooth and oral soft tissue surfaces, without the need to seal the tooth in a contiguous polymer layer, and without the need to involve intervention of a dental professional.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides particles that disrupt and/or impede the attachment of bacteria to an oral surface and compositions containing the particle. The particle includes (i) a core that has an oxide compound or salt and (ii) a bioadhesive polymer. The bioadhesive polymer is attached to the oxide compound or salt. Also provided are processes for preparing the particle, methods for inhibiting or reducing the formation of plaque on an oral surface using the particle, and other related methods.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Biodegradable softeners are described in the prior art. Compositions containing quaternary ammonium salts having at least one long chain hydrocarbyl group are commonly used to provide fabric softening benefits when used in a laundry rinse operation.

Oligomeric esteramines and oligomeric esterquats are compounds commonly described in the prior art to effect fabric softening. These compounds are sensitive to hydrolysis and can degrade over time. Consequently, softening compositions in which these ingredients are present lose some of their ability to soften fabric over time. Correspondingly, clear softening compositions obtained with oligomeric esterquats become turbid or cloudy due to the increased content of fatty acid generated by hydrolysis.

Accordingly, there is a need in the art for improving the stability of oligomeric-type amines and quats while retaining their softening efficacy and ability to provide clear or transparent or translucent compositions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect of the invention, provided is an oligomeric amidoamine comprising a reaction product of (A), (B), and (C) wherein:

(A) represents an alkylene polyamine having the formula:

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2008/062782, filed 6 May 2008, which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be bad breath or oral malodor.

Certain known oral care implements incorporate elements for cleaning soft tissue within the mouth, such as the tongue. Certain oral care implements include bladed tongue scrapers, scraping strips, and tongue scalers.

It would be desirable to provide an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant and deodorant products can be in the form of gels or lotions. These usually are sold in oval shaped dispensers where the lotion or gel is in the body of the dispenser. The dispenser is comprised of a barrel which is closed by a base on a lower end and has a plurality of dispensing openings on an upper end. The base may support an elevator which assists in dispensing the gel or lotion through the plurality of dispensing apertures. The elevator can be moved manually or through an elevator wheel activation mechanism attached to the base. The plurality of apertures usually is closed with a peelable foil seal. This is removed by the user and discarded. This foil provides a good seal. However, it requires another operation in the manufacturing process to apply the seal to the dispenser. Further, if the foil seal is not properly applied there can be leakage from the dispenser.

A new seal has been developed which gives leak proof seals. This seal is formed just subsequent to the formation of the barrel. The barrel is molded and a thermoplastic seal, preferably a thermoplastic elastomer seal, then is molded onto the barrel. The thermoplastic seal flows into each of the plurality of dispensing apertures of the barrel and separately seals each of these openings. This thermoplastic seal usually will be a one-time use seal. However a reusable seal adopting this concept could be developed for particular products if one is needed.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a thermoplastic seal for a dispenser. More particularly this invention relates to a seal unit where projections on a thermoplastic elastomer seal close dispensing apertures of a dispenser.

The dispenser is comprised of a barrel, a base closing the barrel at one end of the barrel and a plurality of dispensing apertures on a surface at another end of the barrel. A seal unit closes the plurality of openings. The seal unit is a thermoplastic, and preferably a thermoplastic elastomer, having an elongated section with a plurality of projections from one side, each of the plurality of projections aligned to enter and to seal the plurality of dispensing apertures.

The base can support an elevator which assists in the dispensing of the substance in the barrel. The elevator can be adjusted by means of a threaded screw or moved manually in the barrel.

The seal unit in the preferred embodiment is of a single use type where it is removed and discarded. However it could be designed so that it can be replaced on the barrel to reseal the plurality of apertures. Additionally there can be one or more grip tabs on the seal unit to assist in its removal from the barrel. In a further preferred embodiment the projections should have coordinated tapers whereby the tips of projections have cross-sectional dimensions that are less than those of the aperture openings. This will provide for an ease in removing the seal but yet provide for a leakproof seal.

The seal unit is formed subsequent to the molding of the barrel. The thermoplastic of the seal unit is molded into the plurality of openings of the upper aperture surface of the barrel. In a preferred mode the seal unit is molded onto the barrel in the same mold in which the barrel is molded. This is through the use of injection molding and a two shot molding technique.

As used herein the thermoplastic can be any one of a class of thermoplastics, inclusive of the preferred thermoplastic elastomers. Thermoplastic elastomers are multi-phase compositions in which the phases are intimately dispersed or are bonded by block or graft copolymerization. When repeatedly heated they will flow and then reset to a flexible solid. They are comprised of a hard segment and a soft segment. The only restriction is that the thermoplastic elastomer must be substantially inert to the substance contained in the barrel and which is to be dispensed.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures such as for cleaning soft tissue surfaces. Some toothbrushes are equipped with structures designed to clean soft tissue, such as gum tissue. Such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain actives such as dentifrice on the cleaning elements for application onto the teeth and soft tissue. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the elements and away from the contact between the elements and the teeth. In addition, the elements do not sufficiently direct dentifrice and associated fluids more towards the mouth surfaces to be cleaned. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being delivered in a controlled manner to the contact of the elements with the gum tissue and the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced. Hence, there is an unmet need to overcome these limitations and other drawbacks of conventional toothbrushes, and to provide new features not heretofore available to enhance oral hygiene.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to a toothbrush with a configuration of cleaning elements to provide superior cleaning of soft oral tissue and teeth.

The present disclosure provides an oral care implement that includes a head and a plurality of cleaning elements for enhanced cleaning of the teeth and soft tissue. One tooth cleaning element has a plurality of bristles adapted to clean teeth. Another cleaning element is connected to the head and has structure defining one or more channels. The channels are configured to direct fluid in contact with the head toward an edge of the head when the implement is moved.

According to one aspect, the structure defining the channels includes a plurality of members spaced from one another to define the channels within gaps between the members.

According to another aspect, the members defining the channels can include a plurality of protrusions forming a plurality of elongated ridges. These structures define the plurality of channels therebetween such that the channels are recessed relative to the protrusions.

According to another aspect, the ridges and channels can have a variety of shapes, including serpentine shapes, arched shapes, and curved, elongated shapes.

The present disclosure also provides an oral care implement that includes a head and a plurality of cleaning elements for enhanced cleaning of the teeth and soft tissue. One tooth cleaning element has a plurality of bristles adapted to clean teeth. Another cleaning element includes a base connected to the head, and a reservoir defined and configured to receive a dentifrice therein.

According to one aspect, the reservoir is a recess defined on an outer surface of the base.

According to another aspect, the reservoir is a cavity defined between the base and the head.

According to another aspect, the base has an aperture extending therethrough connecting the cavity to an exterior of the base.

According to another aspect, the base of the cleaning element has a plurality of protrusions thereon, and the protrusions define a plurality of elongated channels therebetween. The channels are recessed relative to the protrusions, and the channels are configured to direct the dentifrice toward an edge of the head when the implement is moved.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present application relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush which may have an oral care dispenser, such as a breath freshening, teeth cleaning gel capsule, and an oral care accessory, such as a toothpick.

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274 shows an apparatus for brushing teeth that includes an outer bag, a toothbrush sealed within the outer bag, and a dispenser sealed within the outer bag and containing a mouth care solution. In use, the rupturable dispenser is squeezed or otherwise subjected to pressure while the toothbrush remains sealed within the outer bag. Unfortunately, the apparatus for brushing teeth requires an outer bag, increasing the cost of the apparatus, and fails to provide the rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 discloses a disposable, waterless tooth brushing assembly that includes a toothbrush, a non-foaming, saliva-activated, teeth-cleaning agent pre-applied to the bristles of the toothbrush, a small moistened disposable towel for user after teeth cleaning, and a compact, lightweight, two-layer heat-sealed packaging container for pre-use sanitary storage of the toothbrush and towel. Like U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274, the assembly of U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 requires a packaging container, increasing the cost of the assembly, and fails to provide a rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

Published U.S. application 2002/0106234 discloses a chewable toothbrush made of a flexible shell with bristles coupled to the shell and a chewable centerpiece disposed within the shell interior. A burstable capsule is disposed adjacent to the chewable centerpiece within the shell interior and maintains a digestible fluid.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present application solves one or more of the problems of the related art by providing in one embodiment a waterless toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth, and a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice and being connected in the bristle portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening, to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening, between teeth cleaning, and breath freshening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical disposable or limited use toothbrush.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush may have (1) tooth surface cleaning provided by the toothbrush bristles or other cleaning elements and the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser; (2) between teeth cleaning provided by the toothpick; and (3) breath freshening provided by the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser.

As embodied and broadly described herein, an oral care toothbrush may comprise a handle having an oral care head mounted to one end of the handle with an oral care accessory mounted to an opposite end of the handle. A plurality of oral care elements such as cleaning/massage elements, which could be bristles, extending outwardly from the outer surface of the head. The head may also include one or more structures for dispensing oral care material in the oral care field of the head.

The oral care toothbrush may be characterized by its small size and light weight so that it is readily adaptable for travel use. The oral care toothbrush may be capable of having multiple functions by including an accessory as part of the toothbrush such as a toothpick, dental floss or tongue cleaner.

The oral care toothbrush may include a toothpick formed at one end of the handle; and a head connected at another end of said handle, said head having a bristle block that includes a plurality of bristles and retains a gel capsule therein, the gel capsule containing a mouth care solution. In further embodiments, the gel capsule can be replaced by a quantity of toothpowder, toothpaste or a tooth cleaning gel dentifrice, to provide the cleaning benefits of the dentifrice within the rupturable dispenser.

In some embodiments, a subset of bristles in the toothbrush head may include retaining members that hold the capsule in place. The retaining members may extend out of the head's bristle block, and may be curved inward to hold the capsule. The retaining members may be made of the same material as the other bristles, and may be shorter and wider than the bristles to provide greater support and rigidity.

Further features will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only.

Among the advantages of some embodiments of the toothbrushes disclosed herein are that the size and configuration of the toothbrush allows discreet hygienic use, such as no fingers in the mouth, adapting it to be readily used in public areas. Such uses could be done without the need for a sink or fountain or other source of water.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally relates to a package for displaying a plurality of items.

Display packages of various types and configurations are well known in the art and are employed widely in the merchandising field for the display of a given product. Generally, such display packages are preformed closures such as blister or clamshell packages comprised of a substantially transparent polymeric material which allows the product to be viewed by the prospective consumer, and may take a number of forms or shapes depending upon the product to be sold. The package may be generally sealed to protect the items, maintain sanitary condition of the item and/or prevent damage during shipping and storage.

The prior art discloses various display packages. A package for a plurality of elongated swab type applicators is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,759,375. Each of the swab applicators is held in a separate sealed compartment and can be removed individually for use by removing the seal. However, this is not shown in a labeled form and as a display package. U.S. Pat. No. 5,048,684 discloses a compact package for syringes and catheters. A similar arrangement of packaged items also is shown in U.S. Des. 306,404. Improvements, however, can be made to these packages to increase their sustainability. The U.S. Patent Application 2006/0278561 discloses a display package for a group of coloration sticks for coloring wood and furniture. These are each in separate compartments of a two section display package with the sections connected by a hinge. This display package also has an aperture on an upper end so that it can be suspended from a prong by the merchant. However, it uses excess packaging material and is not shown in a labeled form. An unlabeled display package for a plurality of products, each in a separate compartment, is shown in U.S. Design Pat. 196,988. Two levels of separate product compartments, apparently for batteries, are shown. U.S. Pat. No. 5,018,622 discloses a battery display package for four batteries. This display package can be arranged for sale on a shelf or it can be suspended from a prong. However, it has a relatively large bulbous shape which limits the number of the packages that can be held on a prong at the point of sale. It also has a relatively large billboard type of label area which increases the amount of packaging material.

It would be desirable to provide a novel display package of high sustainability and which also maximizes the number of the display packages that can be held on the prongs of a point of sale rack. This is accomplished in the display package of the present invention

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The package of the present invention has a high degree of sustainability. The amount of packaging material used per packaged item is less than in many other types of packaging. In addition the package can be displayed in various ways by the merchant. The package can be displayed on a shelf and sold in a multi-pack format or can be suspended from a prong of a rack.

The present display package for a plurality of items further enhances the sustainability of such packages by reducing the overall packaging needed for the completed package, including the label. The label requirements are minimized in contrast to other label techniques, such as shrink wrap labeling. Further, the label remains a part of the package throughout its use. In addition, the display package has been developed to have an efficient stackable profile when suspended from the prongs of a rack so that a maximum number of the display packages can be neatly arranged for sale.

The invention is directed to a sustainable package for efficiently displaying a plurality of items where the package has first and second containers connectable between an open position and a closed position, each container having an outer surface having at least one elongated protrusion, the at least one protrusion having a head end and a tail end, the head end extending further outwardly from the package than the tail end, and an inner surface having at least one inner cavity aligned with the at least one protrusion, the cavity having a depth varying along the protrusion and configured to receive one of the plurality of items, wherein the head end of the at least one protrusion of the first container is proximate the tail end of the at least one protrusion of the second container in the closed position. The first and second containers can be connected by a hinge.

The at least one protrusion of the first container can be substantially the same size and shape as the at least one protrusion of the second container. In addition, each container can include two substantially identical protrusions each having substantially identical cavities, the head ends of the protrusions of the first container being proximate the tail ends of the protrusions of the second container in the closed position. The protrusions of each container can be laterally spaced from one another. The package further can have a generally planar front sheet of material affixed to and extending between the protrusions of the first container and optionally a planar rear sheet of material affixed to and extending between the protrusions of the second container. Each of the protrusions of the first container can be generally aligned with one of the protrusions of the second container in the closed position. The package further can include a first removable seal affixed to the inner surface of the first container sealing the cavities of the first container and a second removable seal affixed to the inner surface of the second container sealing the cavities of the second container, the first and second seals being concealed in the closed position and removable from the respective first and second container in the open position. The first and second removable seals can be each separable into at least two segments, each segment configured to individually seal one of the cavities.

The packaged items can be a toothbrush positioned within the at least one cavity and each of the cavities and the corresponding protrusion can generally be the same shape as the toothbrush. The brush head is received in the head end of the protrusion and is configured to face generally outwardly from the package in the closed position.

The package can have a first maximum thickness proximate a top of the package measured through the protrusions in the closed position and a second maximum thickness proximate a bottom of the package measured through the protrusions in the closed position, the first maximum thickness being generally equal to the second maximum thickness. The head and tail ends of each of the at least one protrusions are generally bulbous and are joined together by a generally rectangular portion.

The package can include a first removable seal affixed to the inner surface of the first container sealing the at least one cavity and a second removable seal affixed to the inner surface of the second container sealing the at least one cavity, the first and second seals being concealed in the closed position and removable from the respective first and second container in the open position.

The first container can have a lip proximate an outer periphery of the wall of the first container and the second container has an edge proximate an outer periphery of the wall of the second container, with the lip of the first container releasably engaging with the edge of the second container in the closed position.

There can be at least two elongated items where the package includes a container having an outer surface and an inner surface, the outer surface having at least two elongated protrusions, the at least two protrusions spaced laterally apart from one another, the inner surface having at least two cavities each aligned with one of the protrusions and configured to receive one of the elongated items, and a generally planar sheet of material affixed to and extending between the protrusions. The planar sheet can be opaque to at least semi-transparent and can carry at least one of product information and promotional material. The sheet can be confined between outer lateral edges of the protrusions. The elongated items can be toothbrushes.

In more detail there can be a disposable display package that includes four toothbrushes, first and second containers connectable between an open position and a closed position, each container having an outer surface having two elongated protrusions generally parallel to each other and spaced laterally apart from one another, the protrusions each having a generally bulbous head end and a generally bulbous tail end, the head end extending outwardly further than the tail end, the first and second generally bulbous ends joined together by a generally rectangular portion, an inner surface having two cavities each shaped similar to and aligned with one of the protrusions, each cavity containing one of the toothbrushes, and a removable seal affixed to the inner surface of the container and individually sealing each of the cavities in the closed position, the seal divided into two segments, each segment removable separately from the inner surface in the open position, wherein the first container is attached to the second container by a hinge and the seals are concealed in the closed position and exposed in the open position, the protrusions of the first container are generally aligned with the protrusions of the second container in the closed position, and the head end of the protrusions of the first container are proximate the tail end of the protrusions of the second container in the closed position. There can be first and second generally planar sheets of at least partially semi-transparent material having one of product information and promotional material, each sheet affixed to and extending between two of the elongated protrusions on one of the first and second containers.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Light duty liquid cleaning compositions should be designed with acceptable foaming and cleaning properties. Such cleaning compositions should maintain acceptable cleaning performance, have ease of rinsing, and contain a low level of dye mix that yields a near colorless visual appearance. Light duty liquid cleaning compositions should include an ingredient mix that increases utilization of naturally derived ingredients, results in a cleaned surface with minimal spotting and is both mild and hypoallergenic. Light duty liquid cleaning compositions should also be designed to be biodegrade-able and not to leave any harmful residue on surfaces.

Accordingly, the inventors of the invention have developed light duty liquid cleaning compositions, which are suitable for disinfecting all types of surfaces including animate surfaces (e.g., human skin and/or mouth when used as an oral preparation or toothpaste) and inanimate surfaces. This technology is suitable for use on delicate surfaces including those surfaces in contact with food in a safe manner. Moreover, the light duty liquid cleaning compositions according to the invention reduce the amount of chemical residues left on a surface disinfected therewith. Thus, it may be not necessary to rinse, for example, a surface after the compositions of the invention have been applied thereto in diluted conditions. The inventors have developed compositions and methods that include cleaning compositions with enhanced cleaning possessing antibacterial efficacy and low toxicity.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention encompasses acidic liquid cleaning compositions designed for cleaning surfaces including hard surfaces, which deliver acceptable cleaning and foaming performance and exhibit ease of rinsing while leaving low amounts residue.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to toothbrushes which include rotating sections in the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a powered toothbrush and in particular to a toothbrush head having movably mounted bristles. Various types of powered toothbrushes are generally known in the art. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,915 which relates to an electrically driven toothbrush having a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft is connected to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 shows a further type of powered toothbrush wherein the head includes a pair of concentrically arranged sections, each of which is driven in a rotational oscillating manner in opposite directions. The toothbrush head, however, includes only the two counter-oscillating sections. The head does not include any other sections on which bristles may be mounted.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,313 discloses a household appliance which would be used for cleaning, polishing or massaging. One such appliance is a toothbrush. The head has a plurality of co-axially rotatable or parallel linearly movable sections. No provision is made on the head for other bristle containing sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567 discloses an electrically driven toothbrush which includes a rotatable brush head having bristles thereon. Adjacent to the brush head are a further group of bristles each of which rotates around its own axis.

U.S. Pat. No. 1,796,641 relates to a spotting brush usable for dry-cleaning wherein a pair of side by side heads are rotatably mounted.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a powered toothbrush which includes counter-rotational or oscillating sections and a further section having bristles to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush.

In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head includes a first section or tuft block which is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction parallel to the outer surface of the toothbrush head. A second section or tuft block is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction also parallel to the toothbrush head, but in counteroscillation to the direction of the first tuft block. A third section or tuft block is provided on the toothbrush head and also contains bristles.

In various practices of the invention the third section could be a fixed non-moving section wherein the bristles are also fixed. Alternatively, the bristles or the fixed section could be mounted movably in an elastomer material on the section to permit independent movement of such bristles, although the fixed section remains stationary.

In other practices of the invention the third section could be a movable section which oscillates back and forth in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head or in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. In yet another alternative practice of the invention the third section could oscillate in and out in a direction perpendicular to the outer surface of the toothbrush head to form a vibrating section which vibrating section may or may not simultaneously oscillate back and forth.

In a preferred practice of the invention the second tuft head is mounted within and concentric to the first tuft block. The bristles of the first tuft block may extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head a greater distance than the bristles of the second tuft head so as to create a cup-like shape which would facilitate retaining the toothpaste on the first and second tuft heads.

The third section is preferably mounted longitudinally in line with the first and second sections so that the portion of the head containing the bristles of the first, second and third sections is of an elongated shape which would also facilitate holding an elongated ribbon of toothpaste on the bristles.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant salts, such as aluminum chlorohydrex (also called aluminum chlorohydrex polymeric salts and abbreviated here as “ACH”) and aluminum zirconium glycine salts (abbreviated here as “ZAG”, “ZAG complexes” or “AZG”), are known to contain a variety of polymeric and oligomeric species with molecular weights (MW) of 100-500,000. It has been clinically shown that, in general, the smaller the species, the higher the efficacy for reducing sweat.

In an attempt to increase the quality and quantity of smaller aluminum and/or zirconium species, a number of efforts have focused on: (1) how to select the components of ACH and ZAG that affect the performance of these materials as antiperspirants; and (2) how to manipulate these components to obtain and/or maintain the presence of smaller types of these components. These attempts have included the development of analytical techniques to identify the components. Size exclusion chromatography (“SEC”) or gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”) are methods frequently used for obtaining information on polymer distribution in antiperspirant salt solutions. With appropriate chromatographic columns, generally five distinctive groups of polymer species can be detected in commercial ACH and ZAG complexes appearing in a chromatogram as peaks 1, 2, 3, 4 and a peak known as “5,6”. Peak 1 is the larger Zr species (greater than 60 Angstroms). Peaks 2 and 3 are larger aluminum species. Peak 4 is smaller aluminum species (aluminum oligomers, or small aluminum cluster) and has been correlated with enhanced efficacy for both Al and Al/Zr salts. Peak 5, 6 is the smallest aluminum species. Various analytical approaches for characterizing the peaks of ACH and various types of ZAG actives are found in “Antiperspirant Actives—Enhanced Efficacy Aluminum-Zirconium-Glycine (AZG) Salts” by Dr. Allan H. Rosenberg (Cosmetics and Toiletries Worldwide, Fondots, D. C. Hartfordshire, UK; Aston Publishing Group, 1993, pages 252, 254-256).

Attempts to activate antiperspirant salts to produce materials having improved efficacy have included developing processes for obtaining composition having large amounts of Peak 4 species. None of these efforts, however, have resulted in an antiperspirant composition having a composition with little or no Peak 3 and optionally little or no Peak 5.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides for an antiperspirant active composition comprising an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, exhibiting a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution, and optionally including zirconium.

The present invention also provides for a method of making an antiperspirant active composition that exhibits a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution comprising:I) heating art aqueous solution containing an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, optionally with a buffer agent, at a temperature of about 50° C. to about 95° C. to reflux for a period of time of about 1 hour to about 5 hours to obtain an aluminum salt solution;II) adding an aqueous solution of an inorganic base to obtain an aluminum salt solution having an OH:Al molar ratio of about 2:1 to about 2.6:1 to obtain a pH adjusted aluminum salt solution having a pH of about 2 to about 5; andIII) optionally adding an aqueous solution containing a zirconium compound to the pH adjusted aluminum salt solution to thereby obtain an aluminum-zirconium salt solution having a molar ratio of aluminum to zirconium of about 5:1 to about 10:1.

where R is an organofunctional group, and a is an integer representing the degree of polymerization of the molecule.

Internal organo-silicone compounds have the organofunctional groups on non-terminal ends of the molecule, and are also called “comb” or “multifunctional” organo-silicone compounds because the organofunctionality lies in the molecule like the teeth of a comb. These compounds possess the basic structure:


where R is an organofunctional group.

"FIELD

The present invention relates generally to product packaging that displays the products contained therein, and specifically to product packaging that displays the products contained therein that includes a primary package and a secondary package.

BACKGROUND

Many products are sold in bulk packaging which contain two or more of the subject products. In many instances, it is desirable to display the subject products in an organized and aesthetically pleasing manner to potential consumers, while the products remain in the bulk packaging. Display of the products themselves at the point of sale has proven to be a significant factor that positively influences consumer reaction to and/or evaluation of a product, thus, ultimately leading to increased sales. However, the aforementioned goal of product display (especially in bulk packaging) has been limited by the desire to maintain packaging costs as low as possible. Moreover, the requirements that bulk packaging also be structurally stable and versatile in display have also presented significant hurdles in the field. It is further desirable, especially in display packaging, that the packaging be capable of both resting on a store shelf and being suspended from a peg (or similar member) that extends outwardly from a vertical support with no or minimal alteration. It is also desirable that the display packaging be easily storable by the end consumer, especially in bulk packaging in which the products may be used over an extended period of time. To this extent, it has been desired to utilize packaging that is sleek, small in size, and easily portable and/or stackable. Finally, all product packaging should have sufficient structural stability so as to prevent damage to the products (and the packaging itself) during shipping and/or handling.

SUMMARY

The present invention is directed to a display package that, in one embodiment, comprises a plurality of primary packs that contain one or more products and a sleeve. The primary packs are arranged in a bundle and disposed within the sleeve. Preferably, the display package can be stood upright or hung from a peg or other member extending from a vertical wall.

In certain embodiments, a separator panel may be provided to prevent the primary packs from decoupling from one another and/or sliding out of the sleeve. The separator panel may also add rigidity to the display package. Apertures may be provided in opposing panels of the sleeve for receiving portions of the primary packs of the bundle to further facilitate retention of the bundle within the sleeve.

In one embodiment, the invention can be a display package comprising: a plurality of packs, each pack comprising a front wall, a rear wall, and at least one interior chamber located between the front and rear walls for holding at least one product, the plurality of packs arranged in a bundle; a separator panel having at least one upper aperture and at least one lower aperture positioned between adjacent packs in the bundle, a portion of the front wall of one pack in the bundle protruding through one of the upper or lower apertures in the separator panel and contacting an adjacent pack in the bundle and a portion of the rear wall of the adjacent pack in the bundle protruding through the other one of the upper or lower apertures in the separator panel and contacting the one pack in the bundle; a sleeve comprising a front panel having a front aperture, a rear panel having a rear aperture, and first and second side panels connecting the front and rear panels to form a cavity; and the bundle positioned within the cavity of the sleeve, a portion of the front wall of a front-most pack in the bundle protruding through the front aperture of the front panel of the sleeve and a portion of the rear wall of a rear-most pack in the bundle protruding through the rear aperture of the rear panel of the sleeve.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present application pertains to an oral care implement, in particular to a toothbrush with mechanical energy harvesting device and circuitry. Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with mechanical energy harvesting device and circuitry. In one aspect, the oral care implement can signal to a user when a suitable level of brushing has been accomplished.

A number of mechanical energy harvesting circuits may be used in an oral care implement to capture mechanical energy from brushing, and to convert that mechanical energy into electrical energy that can be used at a later time. For example, an oral care implement may have a handle, head with tooth cleaning elements, a mechanical energy harvesting device or circuit (to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy), an electrical energy storage device (to store the electrical energy) and a switching circuit to close an electrical connection with the storage device when a predetermined voltage has been reached.

In one aspect, the predetermined voltage may be determined by taking into account typical brush stroke length, stroke number and force of brushing.

In one aspect, the mechanical energy harvesting circuit can include one or more piezoelectric devices positioned to generate electricity in response to deflections or bending of the toothbrush head and/or tooth cleaning elements.

In one aspect, the harvesting circuit can include one or more electromagnetic generators, having wire coils and moveable magnets, to induce an electric current as the magnets pass through the coils due to movement of the toothbrush during brushing.

In another aspect, a rectifier circuit may be used to rectify the electricity generated by the harvesting circuit before storage in the storage device, and a voltage regulator may be used to provide a constant level output when the storage device is being discharged.

Other features and embodiments are described in the sections that follow.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to a device for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid using a lateral flow test cell that exhibits improved detection.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

The positive/negative assays must be very sensitive because of the often small concentration of the ligand of interest in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and detection of even lower analyte levels in the sample fluid. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides greater accuracy and better low analyte level detection than previously possible in the art. In particular, the invention provides a diagnostic detection device that is capable of detecting the presence of analytes in bodily fluids, even when the analytes are present in very low levels.

In certain embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a label component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention generally comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device that is in fluid contact with the first portion. In specific embodiments the device comprises, in the first portion thereof, a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid.

The device further comprises, in the second portion thereof, a capture component that is directly or indirectly reactive with a second epitope of the analyte.

In other embodiments, the invention comprises a diagnostic device including a capture component that provides for analyte detection at even low analyte concentrations. The invention preferably comprises a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate.

Accordingly, in diagnostic tests wherein a liquid sample for testing includes the analyte to be detected, the analyte produces a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate.

The capture medium preferentially comprises a capture site that includes a capture component for capturing the complex described above. In a specific embodiment, the capture site has immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

The invention is particularly characterized in that multiple aspects of the invention can be combined to provide a diagnostic device including multiple elements useful for providing improved test results, particularly improved accuracy, improved ability to detect low levels of test analyte, and overall improved test results. Preferentially, the invention combines an enhanced label component with an enhanced capture component to improve the overall efficiency of the inventive diagnostic device, particularly in relation to the sensitivity of the diagnostic device.

In one embodiment, the invention comprises a device for detecting an analyte, wherein the device comprises a biphasic substrate, which comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium and formed of a second, different material. The release medium preferably comprises both a labeled conjugate and a capturable conjugate. The labeled conjugate comprises a binding member reactive with a first epitope of the analyte and a label comprising a gold colloid having a mean particle size of about 50 nm to about 100 nm prior to formation of the labeled conjugate. The capturable conjugate comprises a binding member having a site reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, the analyte produces a complex comprising the gold colloid labeled conjugate, the analyte for detection, and the capturable conjugate. The capture medium preferably comprises a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising polymerized streptavidin.

In another aspect, the present invention provides various methods for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample. In one embodiment, the method comprises providing a device for detecting an analyte in a liquid sample deposited on a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device. Preferably the device comprises a biphasic substrate comprising a release medium and a capture medium.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As is well-known, many species of animals and birds are raised and/or kept by people for various purposes, e.g., as pets; for the production of valuable products such as food or furs; or for experimental purposes. A major problem connected with the raising and/or keeping of animals is the disposition of their waste excretions, mainly urine and feces. Whether the animal or bird is caged, in which case its waste is deposited on the floor of the cage, or allowed to roam free but is trained to deposit its waste in a particular receptacle, a “litter” material is generally employed which is capable of absorbing the liquid portion of waste excretions, primarily urine and the excess liquid of fecal matter.

The most commonly used litter box absorbent materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb relatively substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, cellulose, and water-insoluble inorganic salts, such as calcium sulfate. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost, but each suffers from the disadvantage of merely absorbing a liquid waste product and holding the product within its porous matrices, or, in the case of sand, absorbing the liquid dross on its surface. For each absorbent material, offensive odors are eventually caused by the absorbed urine, and the entire contents of the litter box, including soiled absorbent material and unsoiled absorbent material, has to be discarded.

In order to reduce or eliminate objectionable odors, homeowners periodically remove the fecal matter from the litter absorbent physically. However, physical removal of the feces does not reduce or eliminate odors caused by the urine absorbed into the absorbent. Therefore, when the odors caused by the absorbed urine become intolerable, the homeowner discards the litter box absorbent material entirely. The homeowner then washes the litter box and refills the litter box with fresh litter box absorbent material. These activities are unpleasant, time-consuming and expensive. Consequently, the litter box absorbent material usually is a relatively inexpensive solid absorbent material, such that an individual cleaning of the litter box is not particularly economically burdensome. However, repeated litter box cleanings over a period of time accounts for relatively large expenditures.

Of particular interest as the basic component of animal litters are the clayey soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the bentonites, comprising at least one water-swellable clay mineral, e.g., montmorillonite, since these materials have the ability to clump and harden after contact with an aqueous liquid such as urine. This facilitates the removal of only the soiled portion of the litter in a litter box or cage during cleaning without the necessity of removing all the litter.

Many clumping animal litters are made from clays and other mineral substrates. Such litters typically include particles of a mineral substrate, which substrate functions as an absorbent and/or odor reducer. The particles may be coated with a liquid-activated adhesive material, such as gelatinized starch, on the surfaces of the particles. When wetted, the adhesive material is activated and causes the discrete litter particles to agglomerate into clumps.

Although clay-based litters may be functional as clumping animal litters, such litters suffer from certain drawbacks. For example, one disadvantage of clay litters is the high density of the clay component of the litter. Because of this high density, a heavy mass of litter must be used for a given volume of urine. The resulting clumps of spent litter are somewhat heavy, and thus can fracture in the absence of strong interparticle adhesion. Another disadvantage of clay litters is that, because the clay is not biodegradable, the litter cannot be flushed into some sewerage systems after use. This may be inconvenient for certain animal owners.

Clumping litters made from bentonite were introduced in 1989, providing better and longer lasting odor control than did traditional litters. Bentonite is a swelling mineral of the clay category, with a unique ability to gel and agglomerate when wetted, creating scoopable clumps. However, mineral based clumping litter are heavy and dusty. While their innate absorption, clumping, and odor control attributes are good, further performance improvement by solid and/or liquid additives is limited.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A light density clay granule useful for a litter material is provided by treating the clay with an electrolyte solution and then heating at elevated temperatures sufficient to increase the porosity of the clay granule. Substantial reduction in the bulk density of the clay granules has been achieved.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is related to devices that can selectively detect hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-H) for detecting pregnancy in a woman. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of evaluating the viability of a pregnancy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta soon after fertilization. This hormone has the crucial role of maintaining steroid production by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, and ensures that pregnancy progresses unabated. Thus, the detection of hCG has been utilized as a marker for pregnancy in women. Accordingly, measurement of hCG in blood or urine has been the basis of prior and current pregnancy tests or devices.

hCG

More specifically, the hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit is unique. However, there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity (Pierce and Parsons, 1981; Stenman et al., 2006).

hCG has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa. About one-third of this mass is due to glycosylation consisting of 8 oligosaccharide chains covalently bound to the alpha and beta subunits (Pierce and Parsons, 1981). It is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells following fertilization and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy (Hoshina et al., 1985; Lustbader et al., 1998). During excretion, intact hCG can be partially degraded into its component subunits allowing different variants of hCG to be detected in liquid samples, such as urine.

As is well known, the association of hCG and pregnancy was first reported in 1927. During the 1960's, the advent of immunoassays allowed the direct detection of hCG in pregnancy urine (Wide and Gemzell, 1960; Vaitukaitis et al., 1972). A variety of different hCG isoforms or fragments are present in both serum and urine. Intact hCG has been discovered to be the predominant form of hCG and have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy despite the presence of the other isoforms detected include free hCG alpha subunit, free hCG beta subunit, hCG beta core fragment, nicked hCG, and hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) (O'Connor et al., 1994; McChesney et al., 2005).

hCG-H

Although intact hCG is the most prevalent form of the molecule found throughout pregnancy, other distinct isoforms have emerged with different biological activities. One such form, hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H), differs from regular hCG in the amount of and/or location of oligosaccharide chains present on the beta subunit of hCG. This different glycosylation pattern is believed to alter the function of the molecule such that hCG-H provides a role in promoting implantation of a developing zygote.

Whereas hCG production is typically considered to be limited to pregnancy, it has also been found to be produced in certain types of invasive cancer associated with gestational trophoblastic disease (Cole et al., 2006). These tumors (hytatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumors) are both aggressive and malignant, and a key marker for their presence is the production of hCG (particularly the beta subunit of hCG) in the absence of pregnancy (Cole et al., 2003). Research into hCG produced by choriocarcinoma tumor cells identified that there were significant weight differences in hCG derived from choriocarcinoma when compared to hCG present in pregnancy (˜40 kDa compared to ˜37 kDa) (Hussa, 1977; Mizuochi et al., 1983; Amano et al., 1988). Further studies on the choriocarcinoma derived hCG elucidated that the weight differences were due to excess glycosylation leading to significantly larger oligosaccharides on the beta subunit (Elliott et al., 1997). The term hyperglycosylated hCG, or hCG-H, was coined for this higher molecular weight choriocarcinoma derived hCG containing invasive properties, with regular hCG reserved for the hCG with normal oligosaccharide chains found during pregnancy (Elliott et al., 1997; Cole et al., 1998).

Previously researchers developed an hCG-H monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with hCG-H produced by a single patient with choriocarcinoma. This antibody, B152, specifically recognized choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H in both serum and urine. This allowed researchers to more effectively screen and monitor the presence of hCG-H. Subsequent studies utilizing the B152 antibody found that hCG-H is not only produced by choriocarcinoma, but it is also found in very early pregnancy as well (O'Connor et al., 1998), and that hCG-H is the predominant form of hCG produced by cytotrophoblast cells at the time of trophoblast invasion irrespective if the invasion is associated with choriocarcinoma or pregnancy (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Cytotrophoblast cells differ from those that produce regular hCG (syncytiotrophoblast cells), and they confer a different function to hCG-H that is closely linked with the implantation of the zygote into the uterine lining after conception (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Studies have also shown that hCG-H cannot replace the corpus luteum stimulating activity of regular hCG which suggests a distinct biological activity for hCG-H separate from that of pregnancy promoting function of regular hCG (Cole et al., 1991).

Early pregnancy derived hCG-H has the same molecular weight as choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H (Kovalesyskaya et al., 2002), and the majority of all hCG immunoreactivity in serum and urine samples from early pregnancy is due to the presence of hCG-H (O'Connor et al., 1998; Cole et al., 1999; Butler et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2003; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Further, hCG-H accounts for >90% of all hCG at the time of implantation (Cole et al., 2003). This proportion of hCG-H steadily decreases as pregnancy progresses until it only accounts for about 2% of all hCG by the 2ndand 3rdtrimesters.

Early Pregnancy Loss

There is a correlation between low or absent levels of hCG-H in early pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss. In light of research implicating that hCG-H plays a key role in trophoblast invasion, many have suggested that the high incidence of early pregnancy loss in the absence of hCG-H is due to ineffective implantation of the zygote in the uterine lining Some studies have estimated that only 30% of all fertilized eggs continue to term to result in a live birth (Zinaman et al., 1996; Slama et al., 2002). Over the years a subset of these unsuccessful pregnancies that result from a failed implantation have been given names such as ‘occult pregnancies’, ‘preclinical pregnancies’, ‘biochemical pregnancies’, and ‘early pregnancy loss’ (Macklon et al., 2002). They all serve to describe a phenomenon whereby the conceptus is unable to successfully implant and therefore pregnancy does not progress past the first few weeks after conception. The incidence of early pregnancy loss due to failed implantation has been estimated to be about 30% of all conceptions, making it a significant occurrence in fertile individuals attempting to conceive (Wilcox et al., 1988; Macklon et al., 2002).

Fertilization of the egg typically occurs in the fallopian tube approximately 24-48 hours after ovulation. The fertilized egg (now termed a zygote) continually divides as it travels through the fallopian tube. However, its survival is not ensured until it enters the uterine cavity and implants into the uterine lining. Implantation typically occurs from about 7 to about 10 days after fertilization and is the result of several complex molecular interactions that allow the developing blastocyst to embed in the lining and eventually establish contact with nutrient enriched maternal blood (Carson et al., 2000; Enders, 2000; Norwitz et al., 2001). hCG-H has been identified as a marker whose presence (or absence) can serve to indicate if this successful implantation in the uterine lining has occurred (Cole and Khanlian, 2007).

For instance, many studies have found that an unduly low proportion (or absence) of hCG-H in early pregnancy is associated with early pregnancy losses prior to the 6thweek of gestation (O'Connor et al., 1998; Kovalevskaya et al., 2002; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Sasaki et al. (2007) recently found that in 62 successful conceptions, only those that had an hCG-H proportion greater than 50% in the first week following conception continued to term. As such, low proportions of hCG-H around the time of implantation may destine pregnancy for failure due to an unsuccessful implantation. Such studies, taken together with the abundance of choriocarcinoma data associating hCG-H with trophoblast invasion, suggest that hCG-H has an essential role in promoting the invasive properties of the conceptus resulting in successful implantation (Lei et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2007). In the absence of the implantation promoting ability of hCG-H, the conceptus may not achieve successful implantation and ultimately result in an early pregnancy loss (Kovalevskaya et al., 2007; Cole, 2007).

hCG-H and Pregnancy Testing

Traditional pregnancy tests in both the point of care (POC) and over the counter (OTC) markets are developed to detect regular or total hCG. Although both regular hCG and hCG-H can be used to measure pregnancy, they are not equal in the results that are conveyed to the consumer (Cole et al., 2007). As up to 30% of all conceptions result in early pregnancy loss (Wilcox et al., 1988), by assaying for regular hCG alone, these non-viable pregnancies are being detected and conveyed to the consumer as a successful pregnancy. As such, regular hCG can be considered a poor discriminator of pregnancies that may ultimately result in early pregnancy loss. The overwhelming majority of currently available POC and OTC pregnancy tests poorly detect hCG-H, with only a handful of tests displaying equal sensitivity to both regular hCG and hCG-H (Butler et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2004).

Another shortcoming of traditional pregnancy tests is readily realized upon consideration of women who are attempting to conceive through fertility treatments. Such women are typically administered regular hCG to mimic an LH surge and promote ovulation from mature ovarian follicles. This exogenous hCG is gradually cleared from their system over a period of about 10 days (Stenman et al., 1997), but it precludes these women from taking a traditional pregnancy test as it would result in them achieving a ‘false positive’ due to lingering exogenous hCG in their system. If these individuals were to use a pregnancy test specific for hCG-H, the exogenous regular hCG in their system would likely have no bearing on the results conveyed through the test.

Currently, there is no OTC device available that can specifically detect hCG-H. However, there is an automated chemiluminescent hCG-H assay based on the B152 antibody (Nichols Advantage immunoassay) which has been cleared by the FDA for use in pregnancy related applications (Pandain et al., 2003; Weinans et al., 2005). While it is specific for hCG-H, this test requires a long sample incubation time of about 4 hours. Thus, this test must be run in a laboratory setting in order to achieve results (Cole et al., 2004). As many doctors advise women who achieve a positive pregnancy test result at home to wait for at least 6 weeks prior to scheduling a visit, the use of the laboratory based assay to detect hCG-H is not practical as those with unsuccessful implantation related to a low prevalence of hCG-H may have already suffered an early pregnancy loss prior to the doctor's visit. The development of an at home hCG-H based pregnancy test would rapidly convey to the consumer that not only are they pregnant, but that their odds for early pregnancy loss resulting from failed implantation are significantly reduced.

There remains a need for both POC and OTC pregnancy test devices that can selectively or preferentially detect hCG-H. There also remains a need for a pregnancy test device exhibiting an improved level of accuracy for determining the viability of a pregnancy.

"This invention relates to a wrapped soap bar where the fragrance of the soap can be detected outside of the wrapped soap bar. More particularly this invention relates to wrapping soap bars with a film that contains apertures for the detection of the soap bar fragrance at the point of purchase.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The fragrance is very important to the purchasers of soap bars. The customer wants to know the fragrance of the soap bar prior to purchase. When packaged in paperboard cartons, a paper wrapper or loosely packaged in a plastic wrap some of the fragrance will escape the package. However, in more tightly packaged soap bars in plastic materials very little of the fragrance will escape the package. In order to be detected effectively for a purchase decision, more of the fragrance needs to be available to the purchaser. This has been done by “fragrance releasing” attachments to the exterior of the package. The fragrance releasing attachments are effective but add to the cost of the package. An overall objective is to provide the purchaser with sufficient information about the fragrance of the soap bar without any significant increase in finished product cost.

This has been done through a coordination of the soap bar and the package. The package is designed to emit an amount of fragrance during a given period of time. The soap bar formula is adjusted to contain a sufficient amount of fragrance for this given period of time and to have a sufficient amount of fragrance remaining for satisfaction of the user during use of the soap bar.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to a packaged soap bar where the soap bar will emit some fragrance through the package and the methods of making this package.

The soap bar is wrapped in a film material that has a plurality of apertures in the form of shaped openings or slits. Shaped openings have a geometric shape such as a circular, elliptical, triangular, quadrangular or other polygonal shape as well as the shape of a manufactured or natural article. The soap bar has a specified amount of fragrance. The wrapped soap bar has a top surface, bottom surface, side surfaces and end surfaces. The apertures are on one or more of these surfaces. These are apertures of a calculated overall surface area per soap bar to allow some of the soap bar fragrance to be emitted from the package. The overall surface area of shaped opening apertures is about 50 sq. mm to about 1000 sq. mm, and preferably about 100 sq. mm to about 750 sq. mm. When the apertures are slits these will be of a combined overall length of about 10 mm to about 300 mm, and preferably about 30 mm to about 240 mm. The surface area of apertures and the length of slits will depend to a degree on size of the soap bar and consequently the size of the soap bar. The apertures, both shaped openings and slit openings in the film material, are of an overall surface area or length so that the soap bar retains at least about than about 40% to about 90%, preferably about 50% to about 80%, of the soap bar fragrance over a period of six months.

Optionally, in addition the inner surface of the film material wrapper can have a fragrance coating of the soap bar fragrance, or an additional package structural insert, such as a stiffener, can have a fragrance coating of the soap bar fragrance on a surface to enhance the amount of fragrance that can be emitted. Further, after the manufacture of the soap bar the soap bar can be over-sprayed with some of the fragrance of the soap bar prior to packaging. Using these techniques the amount of fragrance emitted over a period of time is enhanced. When the wrapper film material or a stiffener has a full or partial coating, less of the soap bar fragrance will have to be emitted so that it can be detected by the user at the time of purchase.

The film material can be of any plastic or plastic laminate that is substantially impervious to the fragrance of the soap bar. A plastic laminate may be made with paper and have several layers in the laminate. The plastics include polyethylenes, polypropylenes, vinyl plastics including polyvinyl chlorides, urethane plastics and polyesters. The paper used in a laminate can be coated or uncoated with an adhesive or an additive. A stiffener can be of any of these same materials as well as being solely paperboard.

The soap bars are packaged using a film material that has apertures made off-line at the time that a sheet of film material is to be printed with a decoration and product information, or subsequently in-line when the rolls of film material have been formed and are to be used to package soap bars. In the in-line techniques the film material has been printed with a decoration and product information in a prior operation. In the off-line techniques the apertures are formed during wrapper roll stock production.

In either process a film material with the apertures is fed into the soap bar wrapping section of the wrapping equipment. Typically the soap bar is fed into a packaging machine and the film material is fed down onto the soap bar. The length of film material needed is cut. The leading edge of the film material is tucked under the bar and the trailing edge then tucked under the soap bar overlapping the leading edge. The side film material is then folded in and the sides and lower overlapping edges sealed. When a stiffener sheet is to be included in the package it is fed into the wrapping equipment at the same time as the wrapper film, cut to length, and wrapped around the soap bar with the wrapper film. It is not sealed and is open at the ends. It is held in place by the wrapper film.

In either process the product is a wrapped soap bar with apertures of a predetermined, number, size and placement. When the soap bars are to be sold in multi-packs the film of the multi-pack will have apertures, shaped or slit, to have the fragrance that flows through the package of each soap bar flow to the exterior of the multi-pack.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features, as well as methods for constructing the same.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and or mechanically driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. According to aspects of the invention, an oral care implement can be provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head including cleaning elements attached to a carrier that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements can include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements.

Oral care implement configurations according to the invention can be multi-functional and can include various features in advantageous combinations. Some configurations can include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The configurations can be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

One oral care implement configuration according to aspects of the invention includes a head frame and a cleaning elements assembly attached thereto with tooth cleaning elements extending from carriers of the assembly. One or more central carriers can be suspended via a flexible bridge between a pair of support carriers of the assembly that can be attached to the head frame. The bridge can be formed from an elastomer that permits the one or more central carriers to move from an initial position toward the head frame during use. The carriers and the bridge can be formed as a unitary assembly attached to the head frame, such as via mechanical connections. The mechanical connections could include snap-fit connections.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND

The present application relates generally to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, soft tissue cleaners and combined tooth cleaning/soft tissue cleaning devices, and, more particularly, to an oral care implement having a dispenser, such as a store of releasable dentifrice, and a film matrix containing a rapidly releasable agent.

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that can be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale. Further, these types of toothbrushes attempt to provide basic teeth cleaning without effectively engaging soft oral tissues or providing effective tongue cleaning.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The various features described herein can help improve dental care by providing enhanced dispensing of a dentifrice along with superior cleaning of teeth and/or soft oral tissues.

An oral care implement described herein can include a handle and a head mounted to one end of the handle that includes a first face having a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending therefrom, a second face, a store of dentifrice retained at the head, and a film matrix retained at the head containing at least one rapidly releasable agent. The second face can include a soft tissue cleaner including a plurality of soft tissue cleaning elements extending therefrom.

The at least one rapidly releasable agent can be provided to the first and/or second faces during use from the film matrix. In addition, dentifrice can be provided to the first and/or second faces during use from the store of dentifrice. The at least one rapidly releasable agent can include, for example, a flavor agent or a therapeutic agent. The toothbrush can be small in size and lightweight so as to be readily portable for use away from the home.

Other features and configurations are described in the sections that follow.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The use of solvents and detergent surfactants for soil and grease removal is known. Household cleaning products for hard surfaces such as metal, glass, ceramic, plastic, porcelain and vitreous surfaces are available in powder and liquid form. Such cleaning products typically comprise solvents, surfactants and optional builder and/or abrasive additives. However, such compositions tend to leave films, spots or streaks on cleaned, unrinsed surfaces. This often necessitates a thorough scrubbing, wiping and/or rinsing of the surface and adds a time-consuming and physically laborious step for the user. Furthermore, compositions containing detergent builder salts often use inorganic phosphate builder salts, which are not entirely acceptable from an environmental perspective.

Acidic and alkaline hard surface cleaning compositions are also known in the art. Various formulations of such cleaning compositions have been produced that remove grease and other soil deposits. These commercially available products are generally suited for removal of certain types of deposits but are generally not effective in removal of burnt-on or baked-on soil or grease.

Therefore, there is an ongoing need for effective hard surface cleaning compositions that exhibit superior cleaning performance, particularly with respect to burnt-on and baked-on soil or grease, but that are environmentally friendly and avoid undesirable residues.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A cleaning composition comprising:(i) a buffering system comprising a strong base and an organic acid;(ii) an alkanolamine in an amount of about 0.01 to about 5% by weight of the cleaning composition;(iii) at least one surfactant chosen from a zwitterionic surfactant, a non-ionic surfactant, an ionic surfactant and mixtures thereof; and(iv) an organic solvent chosen from lower alkanols, glycol ethers and diethers, and mixtures thereof;
wherein the pH of the composition is about 9 to about 13.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth, such as the inner surfaces of the cheeks.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue. Due to its papillary nature, the tongue creates a unique ecological site that provides a large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue can lead to the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, bad breath or oral malodor may result.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers have not adequately met the need. Past scrapers have typically been taller than they are wide thus risking injury to the user, insufficiently supported, and/or lacking beneficial shapes. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of bacteria and other debris.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and micro debris disposed on the tongue as well as other oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes at least one ridge that includes a contact region for engaging and cleaning the tongue or other soft tissue in the mouth. The contact region defines a width transverse to the length of the ridge that is at least as large as the height of the ridge from the head. In this way, there is a reduced risk that users may injure themselves.

In one other aspect of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes at least one ridge to engage and cleanse the tongue. Each ridge is at least as wide at its base as it is tall to provide sufficient support for the ridge to be dragged across surfaces within the mouth. With this construction, the ridges are generally maintained in a protruding manner to effectively clean the tongue of bacteria and debris.

In another aspect of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes a plurality of spaced apart ridges shaped to present a concave side facing the handle of the oral care implement. The ridges are also preferably formed with a successively broader curve as the ridges are positioned farther from the handle.

In another aspect of the invention, the tongue cleanser includes a plurality of ridge segments that are aligned from front to back at different angular orientations. This construction enables successive ridges to engage the tongue at different angular orientations as the tongue cleanser is moved across the tongue for effective cleaning of the tongue surface.

In another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided with tooth cleaning elements and a tongue cleanser for a thorough cleaning of the mouth. In a preferred construction, the tooth cleaning elements and tissue cleanser are supported on opposite sides of a head.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque is present to some degree in the form of a film on virtually all dental surfaces. It is a byproduct of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. It is reported that plaque adheres firmly to dental surfaces and is removed only with difficulty even through a rigorous brushing regimen. Moreover, plaque rapidly re-forms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel, and on the surface of dental calculus. The problem associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries, bad breath (halitosis) and dental calculus.

As plaque is formed by oral bacteria, a wide variety of antibacterial agents have been proposed to retard plaque formation and the oral infections associated with plaque formation. For example, halogenated hydroxydiprrehyl ether compounds such as triclosan are well known to the art for their antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity. However, these antibacterial agents which work to reduce plaque formation by temporary reduction in the population of oral bacteria have numerous disadvantages when incorporated into commercial products, including disadvantages stemming from production costs and logistics, regulatory frameworks of various jurisdictions, stability of commercially acceptable formulations, etc.

Thus, there remains a need in the art for oral compositions that reduce or prevent plaque formation.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides oral compositions including a safe and effective amount of a compound represented by the formula (I):


wherein R1and R2are independently selected from a hydrogen atom and an alkyl group and X−is an anion, and n is an integer of 1 to 25; and (b) a surfactant.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A number of disease conditions are associated with the action of bacteria in the oral cavity. Dental plaque is a soft deposit that forms on the surface of the teeth as a by-product of bacterial growth. Gingivitis, an inflammation or infection of the gums and alveolar bones, is generally believed to be caused by plaque causing bacteria and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. In addition, plaque provides a locus for calculus or tartar formation. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar), which affects the periodontal ligaments. As plaque and tartar continue to build up, the gums begin to recede, which can lead to continued infection and potentially the loss of teeth.

To prevent or treat these diseased conditions, antibacterial agents are incorporated into oral care compositions such as toothpaste and mouthwashes or rinses. Application of antibacterial compositions in the oral cavity tends to retard plaque formation and related oral infections.

The antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds in a dentifrice composition depends on a number of factors, including the presence of other ingredients that may interfere with its action. For example, certain cationic antibacterial compounds and certain nonionic antibacterial compounds lose their effectiveness when formulated with certain anionic surfactants or other anionic active ingredients, such as tartar control phosphates. In many instances, it is preferred to use antibacterial compounds that do not show the adverse interactions with such anionic components.

Some substituted phenols and biphenols are known to have antimicrobial properties. Natural products such as eugenol (4-allyl-2-methoxyphenol) have been used in oral care as a pulp capping agent and root canal sealer. It is generally recognized as safe by the FDA. A dimer of eugenol, dehydrodieugenol, is reported to be less cytotoxic and have greater anti-inflammatory activity than eugenol. There is an ongoing need to find biphenol compounds with acceptable combinations of antibacterial activity and safety.

SUBJECT OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a cosmetic depilatory composition, which comprises a hydrocarbon resin and a flexibilizer or plasticizer, that can be used for cold depilation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Presently, in both domestic and professional settings, wax depilation is one of the methods most often used for removing hair from different areas of the body to achieve the desired aesthetic and hygienic objectives.

For this purpose, hot, warm or cold waxes are used, which adhere firmly to the hair and permit it to be pulled out together with the hair follicle (commonly described as “by the root”).

Hot waxes are solid at room temperature, are heated until they reach a sticky liquid state, and are applied using a spatula or special applicator. The applied hot waxes are allowed to cool and are peeled off.

Warm waxes are semisolid at room temperature, are slightly heated until they reach a sticky liquid state, and are applied using a spatula or special applicator. The warm waxes must be removed with the aid of strips of nonwoven cloth, cellophane or other materials.

Cold waxes are semi-solid at room temperature, are sold preapplied to strips of non-woven cloth, cellophane or other materials. These strips with preapplied wax are applied directly without need of heating and are peeled off. At the present time, the composition of these cold waxes is based on colophony (pine resin), colophony derivatives, paraffin, silica, oils, microcrystalline waxes, beeswax or polymers, among other ingredients, which fulfill different functions in the formulation of cold wax. The main components (those responsible for the adhesion) are colophony and its derivatives. Colophony is a solid, dark brown or yellowish resin, obtained as a residue from the distillation of turpentine. Due to the intrinsic nature of pine resin and its derivatives, cold waxes acquire a characteristic odor (typical of colophony and reminiscent of turpentine) and color (dark golden-brown) that make it difficult or impossible to color and perfume as demanded by cosmetic market trends. There also exist on the market some cold waxes based on glucose and other saccharides derived from sugar, which in the manufacturing process acquire a characteristic odor (burnt sugar) and color (dark golden-brown) that also make it difficult or impossible to color and perfume as demanded by cosmetic market trends.

The present invention describes a cosmetic depilatory composition of odorless, colorless, transparent cold wax, which can be easily colored and perfumed, permitting the development of more aesthetic and sophisticated products, in line with the cosmetic trends of the current market.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush that releases a chemical into the mouth during use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can lead to bad breath or oral malodor.

While consumers may seek to clean their tongue or teeth, there has not been a toothbrush which provides a chemical sensory response in a mouth to enhance a user's brushing experience. Further, consumers have not been provided with a visual method to select a toothbrush which provides a sensory response. Hence, there is a need for a toothbrush that provides a biochemical sensory effect when in contact tissues of the mouth and supports a method to visually communicate the sensory effect to a user prior to use.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, including a sensory material that invokes a selective sensory response when in contact with the tissues and surfaces of a mouth of a user.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes a releasable material that causes a trigeminal response during use. In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a tissue cleanser provided with the releasable material.

In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a communicative element, such as a two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape, that is visually representative of the sensory response to the user.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a vibrating toothbrush generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush having vibrations that are isolated in the head and having reduced transmissions to the handle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Power toothbrushes generally comprise a power source, a motor and a powered element that is driven by the motor. In one type of power toothbrush, a power toothbrush head is provided with movable cleaning elements that are usually driven laterally, rotationally or in an oscillating manner by a motor located in the handle. The motor generates a vibration that is absorbed directly by the hands of the user. However, such vibration is effectively a byproduct of the motor operation and is usually not intended to enhance the effectiveness of the movable cleaning elements. Instead, the vibration provides a tactile sensation to the user and generally creates a perceived feeling of increased cleaning effectiveness.

Another type of power toothbrush relies primarily on vibrations to produce a cleaning operation. These are normally referred to as “sonic”-type brushes because the vibrations generated to achieve a high cleaning efficacy are generally of a frequency of 20-20,000 Hz that can be perceived by the human ear as a “buzz.” However, the combination of this sonic noise and the high-frequency vibration felt on one's teeth create a tactile sensation of highly increased effectiveness. To achieve the greatest cleaning, it is preferable to situate the vibration-generation device as close to the toothbrush head as possible so as to focus the vibratory energy near the site of greatest cleaning, and not along the handle.

In some prior art sonic-type brushes, elastomeric regions are provided between the motor and the handle to dampen the vibrations felt in the handle. However, such regions tend to decrease the structural strength of the neck and create localized weaknesses in the neck material that could subject the toothbrush to breakage or cause the toothbrush to fail cyclic fatigue tests. Dampening regions are also noticed in other vibrating-type toothbrushes near the junction of the neck and the handle, usually in the form of an elastomeric section or sections of varying configurations. However, again, such sections create structural weaknesses at a location that usually receives a significant amount of stress during use.

There is a need, therefore, to provide a vibration-powered toothbrush having cleaning vibrations that are directed toward or isolated in the head region and reduced in the handle region, and that do not create weakened areas that subject the toothbrush to breakage and cyclic fatigue.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A vibrating toothbrush is provided with vibration-isolating zones that substantially isolate vibrations in the head and reduce vibrations transmitted to the handle, without sacrificing structural integrity. Such vibration-isolating zones may generally comprise neck material that is reduced in cross-section, thinned, replaced by elastic or dampening material, or removed altogether to create transmission-inhibiting voids. Such zones may be further supported by the housing of the vibratory element to maintain the structural integrity around the zones.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an oral care instrument with at least one oral care agent that can be delivered within the mouth of a user to provide the user with enhanced oral heath. The present invention also pertains to such an oral care instrument including a wear indicator that informs the user when the oral care agent has been depleted.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

People exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. As a result, decreasing the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth has long been the target of persons working in the oral health care field.

The most common way of minimizing the harmful bacteria within the mouth is brushing with a dentifrice that delivers at least one oral care agent into the mouth. Orally introduced liquids, including oral rinses, are also utilized to provide additional oral care beyond that achieved while brushing. Mouthwashes may also be used to deliver breath freshening agents within the mouth in an attempt to eliminate bad breath.

Unfortunately, people do not always have the time to provide themselves with adequate oral care. For example, a busy person may not have the time or patience to brush thoroughly, floss and/or use an oral rinse. Alternatively, certain people may consider anything more than brushing their teeth to be unnecessary. For either reason, these people may leave a significant amount of harmful bacteria within their mouths after completing their oral care routines, which can begin to attack the teeth and gums.

Additionally, even when all available and recommended products are used, they may not be as effective as they could be if delivered simultaneously. For example, using a dentifrice and an oral rinse at different times may diminish any synergistic effect that they could provide to the user when used simultaneously.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An aspect of the present invention pertains to an oral care instrument that includes and delivers an oral care agent within the mouth of a user. The oral care instrument includes a head having at least a portion formed of a material that defines cavities. At least one oral care agent is provided in a plurality of the cavities and dispensed within the mouth of a user when the oral care agent(s) contact a fluid or chemical within the oral cavity. In another aspect of the present invention, the oral care instrument includes a wear indicator for indicating the amount of oral care agent.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to an oral care device formed of a polymer that receives at least one oral care agent. The oral care agent(s) can be included in or on one or more surfaces of the oral care instrument for delivery into the oral cavity. The oral care agent(s) can be contained within cavities in one or more surfaces of a head. Alternatively, the oral care agent(s) can be formed into, or carried by, a thin slab subsequently bonded onto the toothbrush head; or applied onto the toothbrush head as a stable coating. The oral care agents can be released during one use, during multiple uses, or throughout the life of the instrument. Water, oral secretions and/or chemicals within the mouth can activate the oral care agents.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders that are the result of complex interactions between periodontopathogens and the host's immune response. It is believed that there are two interrelated aspects to the progression of periodontal disease, the first is the activation of the immune system of the host and the second is the production of oxygen radicals and their related metabolites. Increased production of oxygen radicals may contribute to oxidative stress, which is believed to be involved in periodontal disease.

Gingivitis is the inflammation or infection of the gums and the alveolar bones that support the teeth. Gingivitis is generally believed to be caused by bacteria in the mouth (particularly the bacteria instigated in plaque formation) and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. The plaque and bacterial toxins are believed to instigate oral tissue inflammation within the mouth. Periodontitis is a progressively worsened state of disease as compared to gingivitis, where the gums are inflamed and begin to recede from the teeth and pockets form in the recession, which ultimately may result in destruction of the bone and periodontal ligament. Thus, chronic infection and inflammation potentially results in the subsequent loss of teeth. Further, oral tissue inflammation can be caused by surgery, localized injury, trauma, or necrosis, or various systemic origins.

It is generally believed that the cellular components implicated by these diseases and conditions include epithelial tissue, gingival fibroblasts, and circulating leukocytes, all of which contribute to the host response to pathogenic factors generated by the bacteria. Thus, bacterial infection of the oral tissue ramps up the host's immune response and diminishes the healing process by generating free radical species (reactive oxygen species) and up-regulating inflammatory mediators that cause significant tissue damage.

Free radicals are atoms, ions, or molecules that contain an unpaired electron, and as such are usually unstable and exhibit short half-lives. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are products produced during various biochemical processes, and include superoxide anions (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals (OH−), and non-radical oxidants such as singlet oxygen (1O2). The formation of ROS can occur as part of many cellular processes including mitochondrial respiration, immune cell responses, cell injury, heat, radiation of many origins, from metabolism of drugs and other chemicals. The ROS are highly reactive and modify important cellular macromolecules. ROS initiate or accelerate disease processes.

In one example, ROS are generated during inflammation by phagocytic leukocytes, such as activated neutrophils that produce an “oxidative burst” of superoxide radicals, which are believed to be an essential factor in producing the cytotoxic effect of activated neutrophils. Moreover, superoxide may be produced physiologically by endothelial cells for reaction with nitric oxide, a physiological regulator, forming peroxynitrite, ONOO−which may decay and give rise to hydroxyl radical, OH. Additional sources of oxyradicals are “leakage” of electrons from disrupted mitochondrial or endoplasmic reticular electron transport chains, prostaglandin synthesis, oxidation of catecholamines, and platelet activation.

ROS are thought to be involved in almost all disease processes and the ageing process. Increased ROS formation under pathological conditions is believed to cause cellular damage through the action of these highly reactive molecules by crosslinking proteins, mutagenizing DNA, and peroxidizing lipids.

Another aspect of the immune response is the production of various intra and inter-cellular mediators of inflammation. One class of mediators extensively studied for their effect on the inflammatory response are the arachidonic acid metabolites namely prostaglandins and leukotrienes, that are produced through the cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzyme pathways. These metabolites have been implicated as the prime mediators in gingivitis, periodontitis, osteomyelitis and other inflammatory diseases.

It would be desirable to have a method of treating a mammalian subject having infection, inflammation, and potential cellular damage in oral tissue, by killing the etiological pathogens of infection, reducing the production of one or more mediators of inflammation, and reducing free radical reactive oxygen species to reduce cellular damage to the oral tissue to promote healing.

"The present invention relates to tube containers having shoulder portions that have a barrier unit that has a low absorption for antibacterial compounds, and in particular for aromatic group containing antibacterial compounds. The barrier unit can be a three dimensional insert, a film attached to the inner surface of the tube shoulder/nozzle portions or an inner layer of a co-injection molded tube shoulder/nozzle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Tube containers are used to hold and to dispense a wide range of products. These include adhesives, lubricants, lotions, medicants, shampoos, hair dressings, and various oral care products. Some of the lotions, medicants and oral care products contain an antibacterial compound. A problem with such products is that the antibacterial compound may be absorbed or otherwise degraded by the tube materials. The result is that the tube structure needs to be modified to reduce or to eliminate the absorption by the tube structure for the antibacterial compound. In many cases, and especially for oral care products, it is desirable also to reduce the absorption of the tube structure for other contained substances such as flavors and fragrances. Some package materials absorb flavor and fragrance components in an inappropriate ratio depending on the flavor and fragrance molecules. Thus the flavor or fragrance is changed. This problem needs to be solved for flavors and fragrances to preserve the taste and olfactory properties of the products.

Traditionally, barrier materials have been used to reduce the loss of flavors or fragrances, and in some instances antibacterial compounds. It is widely believed in the industry that a good barrier to flavors and to fragrances is also a good barrier to antibacterial compounds, and that barrier improvement would be similar for all of these organic compounds.

The barrier layer is normally selected based on the flavor or fragrance barrier properties. As used herein the term shoulder/nozzle refers to the shoulder and nozzle as one part or as two separate parts. The shoulder/nozzle, however, poses most of the problems because the shoulder and nozzle are relatively thick compared to the remainder of a tube. This is needed to maintain the mechanical strength of the tube. Further, in order to have good adhesion of the tube body to the shoulder and for cost considerations, polyolefins are usually used as the material for the shoulder/nozzle. The thicker the polymers the greater the absorption. This thickness leads to an unacceptable level of antibacterial compound adsorption. This problem is thought to be solved for flavors by the use of an insert which is a material that has a very low absorptivity for the flavor components. This insert can be an interference fit into the top part of the tube, a film layer onto the inner surface of the tube or a layer co-injection molded onto the inner surface of the shoulder and nozzle.

Unfortunately, the traditional belief that a good flavor barrier leads to a good barrier for antibacterial compounds is not accurate. Polymers will have different adsorption affinities for flavors and for antibacterial compounds because of the differences in structure and polarity of these compounds. It is an objective of the current invention to provide a barrier for tube shoulders, and preferably also the nozzles, for antibacterial compounds as well as for flavors.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

Tube containers are comprised of a tube body and a tube shoulder/nozzle. The tube body usually is of a laminate structure and the tube shoulder/nozzle of an alkene polymer containing plastic. These usually are polyethylenes and polypropylenes. The tube body will be crimp sealed at the bottom after filling. At the other end the tube shoulder/nozzle will be injection molded and attached to the tube body or compression molded and directly attached to the tube body. While the degree of absorption of an antibacterial can be readily controlled in the body of the tube by an appropriate multi-layer laminate structure this is not the case with regard to the shoulder/nozzle.

It has been found that the aromatic group containing antibacterial compounds such as triclosan [5-chloro-2-(2,4-dichlorophenoxy)phenol] are absorbed at a low level in injection molded shoulder/nozzle parts of a tube container if a barrier unit of a copolymer of acrylonitrile and methylacrylate, a polyethylene naphthalate polymer or a polytrimethylene naphthalate polymer is used. The barrier unit can be a three dimensional insert, a film layer attached to the inner wall of the shoulder/nozzle or a co-injection molded layer on the shoulder/nozzle. In addition the shoulder/nozzle can be solely of these materials. The copolymer of acrylonitrile and methacrylate can have an acrylonitrile content of about 70% to about 80% and a methacrylate content of about 20% to about 30%. Through the use of such a shoulder/nozzle barrier unit the absorption of triclosan by the shoulder/nozzle can be reduced to less than about 10 mg/dm2, preferably less than 5 mg/dm2, and most preferably less than 1 mg/dm2for a dentifrice containing about 0.3% triclosan. The absorption can be more than 20 mg/dm2when a barrier unit made from currently used flavor barrier materials such, as polyethylene terephthalate or polybutylene terephthalate, are used. It can range higher when other polymers with barrier properties are used.

It also has been found that when the barrier unit is a polyethylene naphthalate polymer or a polytrimethylene naphthalate polymer the absorptivity for antibacterial compounds can be considerably reduced if the polymer has been biaxially oriented. Such barrier units will usually be in the form of a film. If films of these polymers are to be used polymers are to be used the biaxially oriented version is preferred.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to an oral care instrument, and, more particularly, to an oral care instrument having an adjustable mass centroid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles, and may also have other types of cleaning structures. While toothbrushes according to the prior art provide a number of advantageous features, they nevertheless have certain limitations. For example, certain toothbrushes often do not prevent a user from applying too much force to their teeth. Thus, a user may be scraping off the enamel of his or her teeth while brushing. This may have adverse effects on the user's dental health. In some instances, the distribution of weight of a toothbrush may actually encourage or aid in the application of excessive force.

SUMMARY

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a method and system for adjusting the mass centroid thereof.

According to one or more aspects, a mass centroid (or center of mass) of an oral care implement may be adjusted to counteract excessive force used in contacting a user's teeth with the head of the oral care implement. Generally, the mass centroid may be positioned past the point at which a user grips the oral care implement and opposite the teeth-contacting end. Providing a method and system for adjusting a mass centroid allows a user to grip the oral care implement at a desired location (i.e., rather than at a predefined location along the implement). The mass centroid may be adjusted to provide a sufficient counterforce based on the grip location. Various adjustment mechanisms and systems may be used including, for example, screw configurations and slider controls.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to ansate oral care implements, and specifically to toothbrushes, either manual or powered, that have a handle and a head having cleaning elements for oral cleaning.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes having a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice is often spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process and to hold the dentifrice in place during brushing, the industry continues to pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the preceding technology.

In early attempts to improve the cleaning elements of toothbrushes, oral care implements were developed having two or three circular brush sections arranged within holders that may be screwed into mating receptacles in the tooth brush handle so that they can be removed and replaced as needed. These brush section contain stiff cleaning elements and are spaced from one another along the longitudinal axis of the handle at a distance less than the thickness of a tooth so that the brush operates on both the lingual (inside) and facial (outside) surfaces of the teeth.

Also in existence are toothbrushes having a head containing a flexible, rubber-like prophylaxis polishing cup or “prophy cup” similar to that used by dental personnel to professionally clean teeth. This prophy cup is loaded with toothpaste by the user and applied to the teeth. The “soft rubber-like prophy cup device follows the contours of teeth more effectively than bristles.” A ring of cleaning elements (“bristle tufts”) are placed about the periphery of this toothbrush head which co-act with the prophy cups to clean the user's teeth and gums.

More recently, the strategic arrangement and combination of cleaning elements in the form of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts has become a more common way of improving cleaning efficiency and maintaining the dentifrice in place during brushing. One example of the combined use and strategic arrangement of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts can be found in an existing toothbrush having a head portion comprising a plurality of inner loops formed by elastomeric walls. The central inner loop is surrounded by an outer loop formed of bristles. Central cleaning elements, formed as bristle tufts, are located within the elastomeric inner loops.

Another example of the combined use and strategic arrangement of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts can be found in an existing toothbrush having a head portion comprising a plurality of soft elastomer prophy cups surrounded by bristle rings. A toothbrush is also in existence wherein the centralized prophy cups are formed by groups of densely packed cleaning elements that are surrounded by bristle rings. The bristle rings in this toothbrush have one or more tufts at an inclination.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

SUMMARY

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

The present application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2008/064630, filed May 23, 2008, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement including a delivery system for a fluid. Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristle section followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums. Some toothbrushes have been equipped with fluid reservoirs and systems for delivering auxiliary active agents, such as whitening agents, breath freshening agents, and the like.

Some efforts have been made to configure toothbrushes to deliver active agents at the time of brushing. Commonly assigned U.S. 2007/0154863 A1, for example, describes an oral care implement having a reservoir containing an active agent and a user-activated pump for delivering the active agent through a channel and out of one or more outlets.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement including a delivery system for a fluid.

In one aspect, the oral care implement may have a displaceable reservoir, which contains a liquid substance.

In one aspect, the oral care implement may have a delivery device actuator, such as a switch, for activating a delivery device, such as a pump disposed in the head or other portion of the implement. The delivery device may deliver a predetermined amount of the substance, to one or more outlets. The outlets may be located in the vicinity of the tooth cleaning elements, e.g., bristles, and/or other portion(s) of the oral care implement.

The oral care implement enables a wide variety of active agents to be administered for therapeutic, hygienic, and/or other benefits, such as fresh breath, tooth whitening, reducing sensitivity of the teeth or producing sensations of heat, cool, or tingling.

The oral care implement advantageously may be manufactured at relatively low cost, is easy to use, and may deliver a medium through one or more outlets upon a user activating a switch. By locating a reservoir in the neck portion, the distance that the medium is dispensed to the head is minimized. With this configuration, the implement also is less prone to clogging, the volume of the reservoir may be reduced, and the reservoir may be more easily replaced for changing or replenishment of the active agent.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to novel methods for production of arginine bicarbonate.

BACKGROUND

Arginine bicarbonate has use in various industrial applications, including use in personal care compositions, e.g., oral care compositions. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,558. As the industrial requirements for arginine bicarbonate increases, so will the need for improved processes and methods to manufacture the same.

Arginine bicarbonate may be produced by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through a saturated arginine aqueous solution. However, the efficiency of the existing process needs to be improved. The existing process is slow, requiring 24 to 48 hours to complete the reaction. Carbon dioxide has very limited solubility in water, and releasing the gas into the solution produces a maximum concentration of about 1.2×10−5M at room temperature and its natural partial pressure (3.5×10−4atmosphere). The solubility of arginine in water is only about 15% weight/weight at room temperature. Producing a concentrated arginine bicarbonate solution (e.g., about 40%) requires the continual addition of arginine to the solution, thereby increasing production time and requires constant monitoring of the reaction. Thus there is a need to improve methods to manufacture arginine bicarbonate.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an improved method for manufacturing arginine bicarbonate. The method represents a significant improvement over existing techniques, as a concentrated solution of arginine and bicarbonate anions may be produced in as little as about 10 minutes (vs. about 24-48 hours using the prior art methods), followed by faster and easier recovery processes of arginine bicarbonate salt from the solution since arginine bicarbonate solution at significantly higher concentration. e.g., 60% w/w can be produced.

The present invention includes Method 1.0, a method for producing arginine bicarbonate comprising (i) reacting an arginine slurry with carbon dioxide under controlled temperature and pressure to form a solution comprising arginine and bicarbonate anion, and (ii) optionally recovering arginine bicarbonate from the solution.

Additional methods of the present invention include Methods:1.1 Method 1.0 wherein the arginine slurry comprises arginine and a solvent;1.2 Method 1.1 wherein the arginine slurry comprises from about 10% to about 90% wt. arginine, e.g., about 50% wt in a solvent.1.3 Method 1.1-1.2 wherein the solvent is water;1.4 Of method 1.0-1.3 wherein the arginine of step (i) comprises arginine free base;1.5 Of method 1.0-1.4 wherein the arginine is L-arginine;1.6 Of method 1.0-1.5 wherein the arginine of step (i) comprises a salt;1.7 Of any of the foregoing methods wherein the arginine of step (i) comprises arginine hydroxide;1.8 Of any of the foregoing methods wherein the arginine of step (i) is comprises arginine hydrochloride;1.9 Of any of the foregoing methods wherein the arginine of step (i) is a mixture comprising arginine in free base form and an arginine salt;1.10 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the carbon dioxide is added to the slurry as a solid, e.g., dry ice;1.11 Of methods 1.0-1.9 wherein the carbon dioxide is added to the slurry as a gas;1.12 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine slurry comprises from about 10% to about 90% arginine in free base or salt form;1.13 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the carbon dioxide partial pressure is maintained at a level of greater than about 1 psi;1.14 Of any of the preceding, methods wherein the carbon dioxide partial pressure is maintained at a level of greater than about 15 psi, e.g., greater than about 30 psi;1.15 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the carbon dioxide partial pressure is about 5 psi to about 250 psi, e.g., about 50 to about 150 psi, e.g., about 60 to about 100 psi;1.16 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine slurry and carbon dioxide are maintained under pressure for a period greater than about 1 minute, e.g., about 1 minute to about 120 minutes, e.g., from about 1 minute to about 30 minutes:1.17 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine slurry is heated to about 30° C. to about 80° C.;1.18 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the introduction of carbon dioxide causes the arginine slurry to be cooled;1.19 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine slurry is cooled to about 0° C. to about 40° C., e.g., about 0° C. to about 20° C.;1.20 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine slurry and carbon dioxide is agitated;1.21 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when dissolved in the arginine slurry;1.22 Of method 1.20 wherein the carbonic acid forms bicarbonate anion in solution;1.23 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the initial arginine slurry has a pH of about 10 to about 14;1.24 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the finished arginine bicarbonate solution has a pH of about 7 to about 10;1.25 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine bicarbonate is recovered from the solution by evaporation;1.26 Of method 1.24 wherein the evaporation is by freeze drying;1.27 Of method 1.24 wherein the evaporation is by spray drying;1.28 Of any of the preceding methods wherein the arginine bicarbonate is recovered from the solution by precipitation;1.29 Of any of the preceding methods further comprising the addition of an alcohol to the solution;1.30 Of any of the preceding methods further comprising adding a bicarbonate salt, e.g., sodium bicarbonate, to the slurry or solution;1.31 Of any of the preceding methods wherein calcium carbonate is added to the slurry or solution;1.32 Of method 1.27 wherein the arginine bicarbonate is co-precipitated with the calcium carbonate.1.33 Any of the foregoing methods wherein the arginine bicarbonate solution is used in formulation of a product, without fully recovering and purifying the arginine bicarbonate;1.34 Any of the foregoing reactions wherein the pH of the solution is adjusted to pH about 8 to about 9;1.35 Any of the foregoing methods wherein the temperature is initially raised to greater than about 50° C., e.g., to about 50 to about 70° C., e.g., about 55° C. (e.g., to enhance the solubility of the arginine), e.g., for about 5 to about 60 minutes, then lowered to from about 0° C. to about 40° C., e.g., about 0° C. to about 20° C. (e.g., to enhance the solubility of the carbon dioxide, drive the reaction to completion, and permit the reaction vessel to be opened without excessive release of carbon dioxide from the solution.).1.36 Any of the foregoing methods wherein the initial pH of the solution is about 12.1.37 Any of the foregoing methods wherein the final pH of the solution is about 8 to about 9.0.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Those who cook or work in the kitchen often comment on the disagreeable odors of food and cooking grease that linger after the preparation and/or consumption of a meal, particular those meals that include fish, onions, garlic, leeks, or shellfish. Prior approaches to addressing this problem have included the use in dishwashing products of fragrances that develop blooming or intense odors. Such odors may serve to overpower the targeted malodor and therefore reduce the perception by the user of the malodor. For example, the prior art describes a number of so-called blooming ingredients and compositions able to provide a pleasant fragrance in an area surrounding the dishwashing machine during and after use.

Often these prior art products have an overpowering fragrance that itself may linger too long, in the kitchen. Therefore it is desirable to provide a more subtlety fragranced dishwashing detergent or liquid while still giving good control of kitchen odors. Preferably, such compositions are adapted for use in all types of cleaning products, including those used for manual dishwashing and those used for machine dishwashing.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention includes a fragrance composition that contains at least four compounds selected from a decyl aldehydes, an allyl amyl glycolate, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, a rose oxide, a terpinolene, and 2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carbaldehyde.

The invention also includes a cleaning product that incorporates a surfactant and a fragrance composition comprising: a decyl aldehydes, allyl amyl glycolate, cis-3-hexenyl acetate, rose oxide, terpinolene, and 2,4-dimethyl-3-cyclohexene-1-carbaldehyde.

Methods of reducing and/or eliminating kitchen malodor using these compositions and products are also provided.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to brushes, especially toothbrushes, and specifically to an improved anchor or staple design for securing tufts of bristles within the head of the brush.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In the conventional manufacturing process for brushes, particularly toothbrushes, the brushes are injection molded with empty tuft holes in the toothbrush head. The tuft holes may also be drilled after the injection molding as well as initially formed in the head concurrently with the injection molding. In a secondary operation, U shaped tufts of bristles are inserted into the holes in the head. Each tuft of bristles is held in place by a plate-like staple that is wider than the tuft hole so that when the staple is used to drive the U-shaped bristle tufts into the tuft hole, the edges of the staple slightly cut and deform the sides of the hole. The pressure and resulting static friction of the surrounding plastic on the staple contributes to forces maintaining the staple in place. However, there are certain problems associated with brushes made in this manner. Specifically, individual bristles, or even entire tufts of bristles, may occasionally come out of the tuft holes during brushing by a consumer. The staple or anchor art has dealt with these problems in a variety of ways. However, adequately securing tufts of bristles within the tuft holes must be balanced against other considerations, such as costs of materials and the ability to mass manufacture product.

Over the years, toothbrush staples of the rectangular type have become available in which at least one of the major surfaces thereof is provided with parallel horizontal grooves (i.e. grooves that extend parallel with a longitudinal axis of the staple), thereby yielding a staple that has been found to be more resistant to becoming separated from its tuft hole than staples with smooth surfaces.

Staples have also been developed having a rounded edges that eliminate and/or minimize the problem of tuft weakening and possible rupture of filaments or bristles at the bight of the U. With such a rounded construction, the zone or area of contact between the lower staple edge and the bristle filament closely matches the U shape at the bight portion of each tuft. In turn, this permits the staples to be driven deeper into the head and thus a larger and more consistent force can be applied to each U shaped tuft without cutting or damaging the filaments.

More recently, staples having specialized groove patterns on the major surfaces of the staples for improved retention, including a slanted configuration of parallel grooves, have been introduced to the art.

Staples constructed of materials having oligodynanic action have also been disclosed in the art. These oligodynamic staples have smooth major surfaces and are constructed of a material having oligodynamic action, such as cadmium, silver, brass, copper, stainless steel, titanium and mercury.

Typically, toothbrush staples are constructed of a nickel-silver alloy. Due to the costs associated with the nickel-silver alloy, it has long been desired to create staples from cheaper metals, such as brass. While the general concept of using a brass staple has been disclosed, testing and experimentation have proven that merely creating and using a flat-faced brass staple cannot be used in the manufacture of toothbrushes to provide effective tuft retention. Moreover, merely applying known groove patterns has also proven to be ineffective.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the present invention is a staple having an optimized pattern of grooves in at least one of its major surfaces. The optimized groove pattern makes it possible to create the staples out of a material that is more cost effective than a nickel-silver alloy, such as brass, while still providing the necessary tuft retention so as to be utilized in a viable toothbrush product.

In one such embodiment, the invention can be a toothbrush comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; and a brass staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the brass staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of substantially parallel grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the brass staple to a top edge of the brass staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

In another aspect, the present invention is a staple having a slanted pattern of grooves formed into both major surfaces of the staple. The slope of tile slanted pattern of grooves for each major surface is selected so that the patterns on both of the surfaces act in a complimentary and concerted manner to improve tuft retention.

In one such embodiment, the invention is a toothbrush comprising a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; a staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis, a first major surface, and a second major surface; a first set of substantially parallel grooves formed into the first major surface of the staple, each of the grooves in the first set extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple to a top edge of the staple and slanting upward from a first lateral edge of the staple to a second lateral edge of the staple, the linear axis of the first set of grooves intersecting the longitudinal axis at a first acute angle; and a second set of substantially parallel grooves formed into the second major surface of the staple, each of the grooves in the second set extending along a linear axis from the bottom edge of the staple to the top edge of the staple and slanting upward from the second lateral edge of the staple to the first lateral edge of the staple, the linear axis of the second set of grooves intersecting the longitudinal axis at a second acute angle.

In yet another aspect, the invention is a toothbrush comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; a staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of substantially parallel grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple to a top edge of the staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle; and each of the grooves having a width and adjacent grooves separated by a distance, wherein the ratio of the distance to the width is between 3.0 and 4.0.

In a still further aspect, the invention can be an ansate implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one cleaning element positioned in the hole; and a staple located in the hole anchoring the cleaning element in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of spaced-apart grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple toward a top edge of the staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

In another aspect, the invention can be a staple for securing cleaning elements within an ansate implement, the staple comprising a flat wire having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of spaced-apart grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the flat wire toward a top edge of the flat wire, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Cleaning compositions for use on hard surfaces are known in the art. Hard surfaces include household surfaces such as those typically found in bathrooms and kitchens, and include a variety of different materials such as enamel, ceramic, porcelain and the like. Such surfaces include fixtures such as countertops, appliances (e.g., refrigerators, stoves) as well as bathtubs, sinks, and toilets.

Acidic cleansers are known that purport to provide activity against mineral deposits, e.g., lime scale or soap scum. Some of these cleaners are marketed as being useful for limescale and rust removal, and are said to be dependent upon a certain pH range to retain the desired activity.

However, an ongoing need exists for improved hard surface cleaners that are effective at removing limescale, soap scum, rust, and other soil deposits from bathroom surfaces. In particular, cleaning compositions that are useful as toilet bowl cleaners (“TBCs”) are desirable. Because consumers are often reluctant to scrub toilet surfaces, cleaning compositions that are effective at removing solid and visible deposits such as soil and limescale from toilet bowls while requiring little or no follow-up scrubbing or wiping are especially desirable.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A cleaning composition comprising:(a) an organic acid;(b) a nonionic surfactant comprising an ethoxylated alcohol; and(c) a hydrophilic polymer that adsorbs to hard surfaces.

A composition useful for cleaning a bathroom or kitchen surface, comprising:(a) lactic acid and phosphoric acid in a weight ratio of about 1:3 to about 3:1;(b) a nonionic surfactant comprising a C9-C11alcohol with a degree of ethoxylation of about 7.5 to about 8.1;(c) about 0.1 to about 1% of an anti-adhesion polymer comprising a polybetaine;(d) optionally a thickener chosen from xanthan gum, gellan gum, carrageenan gum, hydroxyethylcellulose; and(e) about 85 to about 95% water;

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. Nos. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C.];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral carrier strips are commonly used to provide an oral care composition to the teeth or other surface in the oral cavity. These oral compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including the enhancement of hygiene and appearance, and the prevention or treatment of a variety of diseases and other oral cavity conditions in humans and in animals by delivering systemic or localized active agents. The conventional strips typically comprise a plastic film with an oral composition applied to the surface.

The design of such film carriers presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Carrier strips must be sized to accommodate a large variation of the dimensions of the teeth and oral cavity of the human and animal subject populations. Conventional carrier strips have several disadvantages: some may be too loose when applied to the dental surfaces, or may bunch up when folded and applied to the front and back portions of the teeth. Carriers having slits to prevent bunching have been known to rip and tear, which adversely affects the delivery function and usefulness of the strip.

In addition to the functional attributes, most consumers expect that the strips will possess and aesthetic appeal. Although such oral carrier strips have generally met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits. Thus remains a need in the art for improved oral carrier strips, and methods of their use.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides an oral carrier strip including (i) a first portion having a proximal longitudinal perimeter and (ii) a second portion having a distal longitudinal perimeter. The distal longitudinal perimeter defines a rounded notch.

Also included are oral carrier strips including a first portion adapted to contact a front facing side of a plurality of teeth and having a first perimeter patterned to substantially match a shape of an outer gingival tissue; and a second portion adapted to be folded around the teeth so as to contact a back facing side of the teeth, the second portion having a second perimeter opposite the first perimeter and patterned to match a shape of an inner gingival tissue. The second portion has a rounded notch positioned in a center portion of the strip.

In another embodiment, the invention provides an oral carrier strip including a first portion having a proximal longitudinal perimeter, and a second portion having a distal longitudinal perimeter. The distal longitudinal perimeter contains a notch that is adapted to inhibit tearing of the strip upon application.

Related kits and methods are also provided.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care instrument, such as a motorized toothbrush, which activates upon exposure to the oral environment of the user.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Powered oral care instruments such as electric, motorized toothbrushes used to clean teeth are well known. Typically these toothbrushes employ vibrating or rotating motion, or a combination of motions, to effectuate tooth cleaning, whitening, and/or repair. Toothbrushes may also include a motorized activator, such as a pump, for dispensing active agents to one or more outlets.

A feature commonly found on electric toothbrushes and other oral care instruments is an on/off switch or button which may be shifted or depressed to electrically activate or deactivate the instrument.

In the case of an electric toothbrush, for example, activation establishes an electrical circuit which causes movement of the bristles for contacting tooth and soft tissue surfaces, or dispensing of an active agent. The switch is typically located on or near the handle portion of the toothbrush. The primary feature of such a switch is that it remains either in the “on” position or the “off” position until the user manually changes it. The toothbrush motor can be engaged or activated prior to the brush head being placed in the mouth, or the user can wait until the brush head is placed within the mouth before activating the motor.

It would be desirable to provide a toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known toothbrushes. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY

Aspects of the present invention advantageously exploit particular conditions which are present in the mouth, either continually or at discreet instances during oral care or treatment. The electrical conductivity of saliva, optionally mixed with toothpaste and water, may be utilized to activate or complete an electrical circuit that powers the instrument. The existence of one or more such conditions provides a basis for automatic functioning of the oral care instrument when a portion (e.g., the head, or the head and neck) is placed into the mouth and the condition, or a combination of conditions, is/are detected.

In accordance with one aspect, a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements and a handle configured to connect to a power source. A motorized device is activated upon exposure of the toothbrush to an electrolyte solution.

In accordance with another aspect, a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements, a handle including a cavity, and a power source received in the cavity of the handle. A motorized device is operably connected to the power source and operably connected to the head. Electrical conducting elements are operably connected to the power source and the motorized device. The motorized device is activated upon exposure of the electrical conducting elements to an electrolyte solution.

In accordance with a further aspect, a motorized toothbrush includes a head carrying cleaning elements, a handle, and a power source contained within the handle. A motorized device is operably connected to the power source and operably connected to the head. Electrical conducting elements are operably connected to the power source and the motorized device. A switch is operably connected to at least one of the electrical conducting elements and the power source. The motorized device is activated upon exposure of the electrical conducting elements to an electrolyte solution having a threshold conductivity.

These and other aspects of the invention are apparent from the following detailed description of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present application pertains to an oral care implement, in particular to a toothbrush with mechanical energy harvesting device and circuitry. Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with mechanical energy harvesting device and circuitry. In one aspect, the oral care implement can signal to a user when a suitable level of brushing has been accomplished.

A number of mechanical energy harvesting circuits may be used in an oral care implement to capture mechanical energy from brushing, and to convert that mechanical energy into electrical energy that can be used at a later time. For example, an oral care implement may have a handle, head with tooth cleaning elements, a mechanical energy harvesting device or circuit (to convert mechanical energy into electrical energy), an electrical energy storage device (to store the electrical energy) and a switching circuit to close an electrical connection with the storage device when a predetermined voltage has been reached.

In one aspect, the predetermined voltage may be determined by taking into account typical brush stroke length, stroke number and force of brushing.

In one aspect, the mechanical energy harvesting circuit can include one or more piezoelectric devices positioned to generate electricity in response to deflections or bending of the toothbrush head and/or tooth cleaning elements.

In one aspect, the harvesting circuit can include one or more electromagnetic generators, having wire coils and moveable magnets, to induce an electric current as the magnets pass through the coils due to movement of the toothbrush during brushing.

In another aspect, a rectifier circuit may be used to rectify the electricity generated by the harvesting circuit before storage in the storage device, and a voltage regulator may be used to provide a constant level output when the storage device is being discharged.

Other features and embodiments are described in the sections that follow.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A number of disease conditions are associated with the action of bacteria in the oral cavity. Dental plaque is a soft deposit that forms on the surface of the teeth as a by-product of bacterial growth. Gingivitis, an inflammation or infection of the gums and alveolar bones, is generally believed to be caused by plaque causing bacteria and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. In addition, plaque provides a locus for calculus or tartar formation. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar), which effects the periodontal ligaments. As plaque and tartar continue to build up, the gums begin to recede, which can lead to continued infection and potentially the loss of teeth.

To prevent or treat these diseased conditions, antibacterial agents are incorporated into oral care compositions such as toothpaste and mouthwashes or rinses. Application of antibacterial compositions in the oral cavity tends to retard plaque formation and related oral infections.

The antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds in a dentifrice composition depends on a number of factors, including the presence of other ingredients that may interfere with its action. For example, certain cationic antibacterial compounds and certain nonionic antibacterial compounds lose their effectiveness when formulated with certain anionic surfactants or other anionic active ingredients, such as tartar control phosphates. In many instances, it is preferred to use antibacterial compounds that do not show the adverse interactions with such anionic components.

Extracts fromMagnolia officinalis(hereinafter “magnolia”), and especially from the bark, contain biphenol antibacterial compounds that include honokiol and tetrahydrohonokiol. The extracts have been found to have antibacterial effectiveness when formulated into, for example, toothpaste formulations.

Extracts prepared from natural sources such asmagnoliaare variable in composition and contain many compounds other than the particular actives for which the extract is prepared. The mode of activity of the extract compounds is not well characterized, so that it is unpredictable how alterations in structure of any of the extract compounds would affect its antibacterial effectiveness. In addition, the composition of the extracts can vary from season to season and between different geographical regions. As a result, the antibacterial activity of the extracts in vivo is far from optimal.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to oral care implements in general, and more particularly to a method of forming a light-emitting toothbrush.

BACKGROUND

Toothbrushes are generally made in a method in which nylon bristled stock is anchored to a plastic toothbrush head via a metal staple. This requires a minimum head thickness of around 5 millimeters in order to reduce the possibility of plastic breakage during the stapling process given the tuft densities of most standard brushes. Furthermore, the toothbrush head and handle is generally molded in one step and it is a solid plastic part. This does not lend itself to placement of a light source in the toothbrush head.

In another well known process called in-mold tufting (IMT), nylon bristles are gathered and placed in an injection mold. Plastic is then injected around the bristles forming the toothbrush head and handle. The head must be large enough that plastic can flow over and around the “fused balls of nylon” commonly seen in these type of processes. The plastic over the fused balls retains the tuft in the brush during normal use. Once again there are generally no allowances made for insertion of a light source.

In each of these methods, incorporating a light source requires a post-processing step, such that the head must be made to accommodate a light source or the transmission of light from a source outside of the head. This post-processing requires time and resources, and often increases the cost to an unacceptable level. Or as an alternative, it requires making the head at a greater thickness (allowing for creation of a hollow section) increasing discomfort for the user while decreasing the user's ease of maneuverability. Accordingly, there is a need, therefore, for a practical, cost-efficient method of forming a light-emitting oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, that has an acceptable thickness and that is comfortable to the user.

Such need is met using a method of making an oral care implement or toothbrush where, for example, a head plate and handle are molded separately. The head plate is filled with cleaning elements such as nylon and the nylon is melted to an extremely thin “mat”. Afterwards, this relatively thin head plate is ultrasonically welded to the handle. In this method there is an open cavity in the toothbrush head, or the toothbrush head is effectively hollow, allowing the opportunity to place light emitting elements or other items in the toothbrush head that may provide a therapeutic or cosmetic benefit. Included could be alarms or some other device that signal proper or improper brushing techniques, proper amount of brushing time, etc.

SUMMARY

An oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, comprises a head, a plurality of cleaning elements defined thereon, and a light source incorporated into or adjacent the head. The light source is incorporated into the implement prior to the incorporation of the cleaning elements for ease of manufacturing and a cost-effective, user-friendly assembly. The cleaning elements are preferably pre-formed and attached to the head after the light source so that the provision of the light source does not require any post-processing that might impair the integrity of the head or cleaning elements or unduly enlarge the head so that it is uncomfortable to the user.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is related to devices that can selectively detect hyperglycosylated human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG-H) for detecting pregnancy in a woman. Another aspect of the present invention relates to a method of evaluating the viability of a pregnancy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein produced by the placenta soon after fertilization. This hormone has the crucial role of maintaining steroid production by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, and ensures that pregnancy progresses unabated. Thus, the detection of hCG has been utilized as a marker for pregnancy in women. Accordingly, measurement of hCG in blood or urine has been the basis of prior and current pregnancy tests or devices.

hCG

More specifically, the hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit is unique. However, there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity (Pierce and Parsons, 1981; Stenman et al., 2006).

hCG has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa. About one-third of this mass is due to glycosylation consisting of 8 oligosaccharide chains covalently bound to the alpha and beta subunits (Pierce and Parsons, 1981). It is produced by the syncytiotrophoblast cells following fertilization and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy (Hoshina et al., 1985; Lustbader et al., 1998). During excretion, intact hCG can be partially degraded into its component subunits allowing different variants of hCG to be detected in liquid samples, such as urine.

As is well known, the association of hCG and pregnancy was first reported in 1927. During the 1960's, the advent of immunoassays allowed the direct detection of hCG in pregnancy urine (Wide and Gemzell, 1960; Vaitukaitis et al., 1972). A variety of different hCG isoforms or fragments are present in both serum and urine. Intact hCG has been discovered to be the predominant form of hCG and have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy despite the presence of the other isoforms detected include free hCG alpha subunit, free hCG beta subunit, hCG beta core fragment, nicked hCG, and hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) (O'Connor et al., 1994; McChesney et al., 2005).

hCG-H

Although intact hCG is the most prevalent form of the molecule found throughout pregnancy, other distinct isoforms have emerged with different biological activities. One such form, hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H), differs from regular hCG in the amount of and/or location of oligosaccharide chains present on the beta subunit of hCG. This different glycosylation pattern is believed to alter the function of the molecule such that hCG-H provides a role in promoting implantation of a developing zygote.

Whereas hCG production is typically considered to be limited to pregnancy, it has also been found to be produced in certain types of invasive cancer associated with gestational trophoblastic disease (Cole et al., 2006). These tumors (hytatidiform mole, choriocarcinoma, and placental site trophoblastic tumors) are both aggressive and malignant, and a key marker for their presence is the production of hCG (particularly the beta subunit of hCG) in the absence of pregnancy (Cole et al., 2003). Research into hCG produced by choriocarcinoma tumor cells identified that there were significant weight differences in hCG derived from choriocarcinoma when compared to hCG present in pregnancy (˜40 kDa compared to ˜37 kDa) (Hussa, 1977; Mizuochi et al., 1983; Amano et al., 1988). Further studies on the choriocarcinoma derived hCG elucidated that the weight differences were due to excess glycosylation leading to significantly larger oligosaccharides on the beta subunit (Elliott et al., 1997). The term hyperglycosylated hCG, or hCG-H, was coined for this higher molecular weight choriocarcinoma derived hCG containing invasive properties, with regular hCG reserved for the hCG with normal oligosaccharide chains found during pregnancy (Elliott et al., 1997; Cole et al., 1998).

Previously researchers developed an hCG-H monoclonal antibody by immunizing mice with hCG-H produced by a single patient with choriocarcinoma. This antibody, B152, specifically recognized choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H in both serum and urine. This allowed researchers to more effectively screen and monitor the presence of hCG-H. Subsequent studies utilizing the B152 antibody found that hCG-H is not only produced by choriocarcinoma, but it is also found in very early pregnancy as well (O'Connor et al., 1998), and that hCG-H is the predominant form of hCG produced by cytotrophoblast cells at the time of trophoblast invasion irrespective if the invasion is associated with choriocarcinoma or pregnancy (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Cytotrophoblast cells differ from those that produce regular hCG (syncytiotrophoblast cells), and they confer a different function to hCG-H that is closely linked with the implantation of the zygote into the uterine lining after conception (Kovalevskaya et al., 2002). Studies have also shown that hCG-H cannot replace the corpus luteum stimulating activity of regular hCG which suggests a distinct biological activity for hCG-H separate from that of pregnancy promoting function of regular hCG (Cole et al., 1991).

Early pregnancy derived hCG-H has the same molecular weight as choriocarcinoma derived hCG-H (Kovalesyskaya et al., 2002), and the majority of all hCG immunoreactivity in serum and urine samples from early pregnancy is due to the presence of hCG-H (O'Connor et al., 1998; Cole et al., 1999; Butler et al., 2002; Cole et al., 2003; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Further, hCG-H accounts for >90% of all hCG at the time of implantation (Cole et al., 2003). This proportion of hCG-H steadily decreases as pregnancy progresses until it only accounts for about 2% of all hCG by the 2ndand 3rdtrimesters.

Early Pregnancy Loss

There is a correlation between low or absent levels of hCG-H in early pregnancy, and early pregnancy loss. In light of research implicating that hCG-H plays a key role in trophoblast invasion, many have suggested that the high incidence of early pregnancy loss in the absence of hCG-H is due to ineffective implantation of the zygote in the uterine lining. Some studies have estimated that only 30% of all fertilized eggs continue to term to result in a live birth (Zinaman et al., 1996; Slama et al., 2002). Over the years a subset of these unsuccessful pregnancies that result from a failed implantation have been given names such as ‘occult pregnancies’, ‘preclinical pregnancies’, ‘biochemical pregnancies’, and ‘early pregnancy loss’ (Macklon et al., 2002). They all serve to describe a phenomenon whereby the conceptus is unable to successfully implant and therefore pregnancy does not progress past the first few weeks after conception. The incidence of early pregnancy loss due to failed implantation has been estimated to be about 30% of all conceptions, making it a significant occurrence in fertile individuals attempting to conceive (Wilcox et al., 1988; Macklon et al., 2002).

Fertilization of the egg typically occurs in the fallopian tube approximately 24-48 hours after ovulation. The fertilized egg (now termed a zygote) continually divides as it travels through the fallopian tube. However, its survival is not ensured until it enters the uterine cavity and implants into the uterine lining. Implantation typically occurs from about 7 to about 10 days after fertilization and is the result of several complex molecular interactions that allow the developing blastocyst to embed in the lining and eventually establish contact with nutrient enriched maternal blood (Carson et al., 2000; Enders, 2000; Norwitz et al., 2001). hCG-H has been identified as a marker whose presence (or absence) can serve to indicate if this successful implantation in the uterine lining has occurred (Cole and Khanlian, 2007).

For instance, many studies have found that an unduly low proportion (or absence) of hCG-H in early pregnancy is associated with early pregnancy losses prior to the 6thweek of gestation (O'Connor et al., 1998; Kovalevskaya et al., 2002; Sutton-Riley et al., 2006). Sasaki et al. (2007) recently found that in 62 successful conceptions, only those that had an hCG-H proportion greater than 50% in the first week following conception continued to term. As such, low proportions of hCG-H around the time of implantation may destine pregnancy for failure due to an unsuccessful implantation. Such studies, taken together with the abundance of choriocarcinoma data associating hCG-H with trophoblast invasion, suggest that hCG-H has an essential role in promoting the invasive properties of the conceptus resulting in successful implantation (Lei et al., 1999; Cole et al., 2007). In the absence of the implantation promoting ability of hCG-H, the conceptus may not achieve successful implantation and ultimately result in an early pregnancy loss (Kovalevskaya et al., 2007; Cole, 2007).

hCG-H and Pregnancy Testing

Traditional pregnancy tests in both the point of care (POC) and over the counter (OTC) markets are developed to detect regular or total hCG. Although both regular hCG and hCG-H can be used to measure pregnancy, they are not equal in the results that are conveyed to the consumer (Cole et al., 2007). As up to 30% of all conceptions result in early pregnancy loss (Wilcox et al., 1988), by assaying for regular hCG alone, these non-viable pregnancies are being detected and conveyed to the consumer as a successful pregnancy. As such, regular hCG can be considered a poor discriminator of pregnancies that may ultimately result in early pregnancy loss. The overwhelming majority of currently available POC and OTC pregnancy tests poorly detect hCG-H, with only a handful of tests displaying equal sensitivity to both regular hCG and hCG-H (Butler et al., 2001; Cole et al., 2003; Cole et al., 2004).

Another shortcoming of traditional pregnancy tests is readily realized upon consideration of women who are attempting to conceive through fertility treatments. Such women are typically administered regular hCG to mimic an LH surge and promote ovulation from mature ovarian follicles. This exogenous hCG is gradually cleared from their system over a period of about 10 days (Stenman et al., 1997), but it precludes these women from taking a traditional pregnancy test as it would result in them achieving a ‘false positive’ due to lingering exogenous hCG in their system. If these individuals were to use a pregnancy test specific for hCG-H, the exogenous regular hCG in their system would likely have no bearing on the results conveyed through the test.

Currently, there is no OTC device available that can specifically detect hCG-H. However, there is an automated chemiluminescent hCG-H assay based on the B152 antibody (Nichols Advantage immunoassay) which has been cleared by the FDA for use in pregnancy related applications (Pandain et al., 2003; Weinans et al., 2005). While it is specific for hCG-H, this test requires a long sample incubation time of about 4 hours. Thus, this test must be run in a laboratory setting in order to achieve results (Cole et al., 2004). As many doctors advise women who achieve a positive pregnancy test result at home to wait for at least 6 weeks prior to scheduling a visit, the use of the laboratory based assay to detect hCG-H is not practical as those with unsuccessful implantation related to a low prevalence of hCG-H may have already suffered an early pregnancy loss prior to the doctor's visit. The development of an at home hCG-H based pregnancy test would rapidly convey to the consumer that not only are they pregnant, but that their odds for early pregnancy loss resulting from failed implantation are significantly reduced.

There remains a need for both POC and OTC pregnancy test devices that can selectively or preferentially detect hCG-H. There also remains a need for a pregnancy test device exhibiting an improved level of accuracy for determining the viability of a pregnancy.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to a method of manufacturing a condom whereby the condom possesses one or more textured rings, spirals, dots, images, or raised surfaces with the intention of providing a “pleasure bump” or visual cue for increasing stimulation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There has developed around rubber latex a substantial industry for producing such articles as condoms, rubber gloves, surgical supplies, balloons, bathing caps and countless other articles. The articles are generally produced by dipping glass, porcelain or metal mandrels into natural rubber latex baths and subsequently coagulating and curing the thin film of latex, which adheres to the mandrel. Thicker films are obtained by repeating the dipping, coagulating and curing operations as desired. The films are stripped from the mandrels and may optionally be further cured at elevated temperatures.

Normally a condom is made of strong, fine rubber, fine animal membrane or a synthetic polymer such as polyurethane. Of necessity, in order to provide an acceptable level of tactile stimulation to the wearer, the condom must be quite thin. In general, it is elastically fitted to the male organ and during coitus remains stretch and taut.

The traditional methods of manufacturing a contraceptive, prophylactic or condom involve the so-called straight dipping or dip and dry techniques wherein a phallic shaped mandrel of predetermined size is, optionally coated with a coagulating agent, and dipped into a bath containing natural rubber latex or a solution of synthetic polymer such as polyurethane. The mandrel when dipped may be stationary or rotating about its longitudinal axis. The mandrel is then removed from the bath, dried and cured. This process can be repeated several times until a condom of the desired thickness properties are achieved. During dipping, the mandrel is immersed to a depth sufficient to yield the finished condom of desired length plus an additional distance to allow for rolling the sheath on itself for several turns in order to form a ring at the open end of the condom. Following a final cure, the formed condom may be coated with an anti-tack material such as talc, micro-porous solid particles, lubricants, slip agents, spermicides, deodorants, etc., prior to removal from the mandrel.

After completion of the dipping, ring-forming, curing and optional coating steps, the condom is removed from the mandrel, and optionally subjected to additional drying, further curing, and quality testing. Prior to packaging, the condoms are quality tested and rolled to form a cup-shaped elastic ring of predetermined size and circumference. At this point, additional lubricants, spermicides, bactericides, etc., may also be added to the condom. In this form, the condom is easily mountable for use during sexual intercourse by unrolling onto the penis.

Currently, condoms are manufactured under the Trojan Brand™ name, as well as other names with ribbed features. These ribbed features are typically made by dipping a mandrel with an etched surface into a latex bath. Latex deposits on the surface of the dipped mandrel to form the basic condom shape, while the latex that deposits in the etchings leaves behind a ribbed feature on the finished condom exterior.

However through trial and error, it has been determined that for a condom having a typical mid-point thickness of 0.075 mm, the maximum height that can be accomplished by the above mentioned technique is only about 0.1 mm or less. Such height usually does not provide much sensation to the condom user or partner. Attempting to make features with a greater height, through deeper etching of the condom mandrel, results in the formation of unacceptable weak spots on the condom. Broader (wider) raised patterns are also problematic. Latex tends to form a uniform coating in a broadly etched section of the mandrel rather than filling the void. This results in the pattern being lost once the condom is removed from the mandrel.

By using a grooved mandrel on which condoms are manufactured by a dip molding process, it is possible to produce condoms with ribs that are claimed to heighten stimulation during coitus. However, the ribs on such condoms produced by the known method are not effectively positioned or lack sufficient structural rigidity to produce effective clitoral and labial stimulation, and the production of pronounced ribbing by shaping of the mandrel weakens the structural integrity of the condom which is plainly unacceptable.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,661 to Solanki et al discloses a method for producing condom having monolithic projections to promote stimulation of clitoris. Specifically, Solanki et al. apply the projections between dips to a pre-deposited latex sheath. However such method substantially slows down the production speed, and the ability to manufacture a wider array of projections onto condoms is limited. Therefore, there remains a need for an efficient method of producing such condoms having projections greater than 0.1 mm in height to produce stimulation,

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A method of manufacturing a condom comprising: 1) applying latex (as is or thickened with some agent) or another latex compatible vehicle directly to the surface of the condom mandrel to produce a raised pattern akin to bas relief; 2), drying the applied pattern, dipping the patterned mandrel in latex one or more times (over dip) to form a condom containing the raised pattern.

"BACKGROUND

This invention relates to a substantially blow-molded dispensing container with a fitment where the dispensing pump can be reused with additional refill dispensing containers, but the dispensing container and the fitment are of a structure to preclude the reuse of the dispensing container. This structure prevents the use of the dispensing container with counterfeit products.

Containers with dispensing pumps are used for a number of different products. In many uses the products are related to the health and safety of the user. For this reason the containers should not be reused for a counterfeit product or for a different product. In use for a counterfeit product the consumer will purchase the counterfeit product in the belief that it is the original product. In this regard the consumer would not be receiving the benefits of the original product. The consumer could also be receiving a product that could be harmful to his/her health. For the manufacturer of the original product this will lead to a loss of sales and if the counterfeit product is defective it can cause injury. Tamper-proof structures are developed to prevent the reuse of dispensing containers for counterfeit products. The present invention is directed to a solution to prevent the reuse of dispensing containers for counterfeit products. There is provided security, lower cost and a structure that precludes the overflow of liquid from the container when a dispensing pump is inserted into the dispensing container.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush which may have an oral care dispenser, such as a breath freshening, teeth cleaning gel capsule, and an oral care accessory, such as a toothpick.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274 shows an apparatus for brushing teeth that includes an outer bag, a toothbrush sealed within the outer bag, and a dispenser sealed within the outer bag and containing a mouth care solution. In use, the rupturable dispenser is squeezed or otherwise subjected to pressure while the toothbrush remains sealed within the outer bag. Unfortunately, the apparatus for brushing teeth requires an outer bag, increasing the cost of the apparatus, and fails to provide the rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 discloses a disposable, waterless tooth brushing assembly that includes a toothbrush, a non-foaming, saliva-activated, teeth-cleaning agent pre-applied to the bristles of the toothbrush, a small moistened disposable towel for user after teeth cleaning, and a compact, lightweight, two-layer heat-sealed packaging container for pre-use sanitary storage of the toothbrush and towel. Like U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274, the assembly of U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 requires a packaging container, increasing the cost of the assembly, and fails to provide a rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

Published U.S. application 2002/0106234 discloses a chewable toothbrush made of a flexible shell with bristles coupled to the shell and a chewable centerpiece disposed within the shell interior. A burstable capsule is disposed adjacent to the chewable centerpiece within the shell interior and maintains a digestible fluid.

None of the toothbrush assemblies of the related art includes a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice, a toothpick, and a toothbrush as one complete, connected unit or the various other combinations of oral care members and materials, later described. Thus, there is a need in the art for a waterless, toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth or other accessory, and a dispenser containing a dentifrice or other oral care material and being connected in the bristle or cleaning element portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening or other oral care benefits.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves the problems of the related art by providing in one embodiment a waterless toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth, and a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice and being connected in the bristle portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening, all of which deliver a cleaning, polishing whitening between teeth cleaning, and breath freshening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical disposable or limited use toothbrush. The toothbrush of the present invention in this embodiment combines three benefits into one toothbrush: (1) tooth surface cleaning provided by the toothbrush bristles or other cleaning elements and the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser; (2) between teeth cleaning provided by the toothpick; and (3) breath freshening provided by the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser.

As embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention is broadly drawn to an oral care toothbrush, preferably comprising: a handle having an oral care head mounted to one end of the handle with an oral care accessory mounted to an opposite end of the handle. A plurality of oral care elements such as cleaning/massage elements, which could be bristles, extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head. The head also includes structure for dispensing oral care material in the oral care field of the head.

In a preferred practice of the invention the oral care toothbrush is characterized by its small size and light weight so that it is readily adaptable for travel use. The oral care toothbrush is preferably capable of having multiple functions by including an accessory as part of the toothbrush such as a toothpick, dental floss or tongue cleaner.

In one practice of this invention the oral care toothbrush includes a toothpick formed at one end of the handle; and a head connected at another end of said handle, said head having a bristle block that includes a plurality of bristles and retains a gel capsule therein, the gel capsule containing a mouth care solution. In further embodiments, the gel capsule can be replaced by a quantity of toothpowder, toothpaste or a tooth cleaning gel dentifrice, to provide the cleaning benefits of the dentifrice within the rupturable dispenser.

Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

Among the advantages of various practices of the invention are that the size and configuration of the toothbrush allows discreet hygienic use, such as no fingers in the mouth, adapting it to be readily used in public areas. Such uses could be done without the need for a sink or fountain or other source of water.

"BACKGROUND

The present application relates generally to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, soft tissue cleaners and combined tooth cleaning/soft tissue cleaning devices, and, more particularly, to an oral care implement having an enhanced oral care dispenser mechanism, such as a store of releasable dentifrice and an enhanced mechanism for dispensing the dentifrice during use.

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that can be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply.

This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale. Further, these types of toothbrushes attempt to provide basic teeth cleaning without effectively engaging soft oral tissues or providing effective tongue cleaning.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The various features described herein can help improve dental care by providing enhanced dispensing of a oral care material along with superior cleaning of teeth and/or soft oral tissues.

An oral care implement described herein can include a handle and a head mounted to one end of the handle that includes a first face having a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending therefrom, a second face, and a store of oral care material such as dentifrice. Oral care material can be provided to the first and second faces during use from the store of oral care material. The second face can include a plurality of soft tissue cleaning elements extending therefrom.

The oral care implement can include a plurality of stores of oral care material, which can be different oral care materials. Further, a store of oral care material can be located within an arrangement of the tooth cleaning elements to provide oral care material thereto, and can be accessible through the head to an arrangement of the soft tissue cleaning elements to further provide dentifrice thereto. The store or stores of oral care material can include a rupturable or dissolvable store of oral care material, which can simultaneously dispense oral care material to the teeth and to soft tissues, such as the inside of cheeks or the surface of the tongue, to provide cleaning and other benefits, such as breath freshening.

Other features and configurations are described in the sections that follow.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to systems and processes suitable for measuring process parameters of process systems, primarily systems for processing food products, making use of application specific integrated circuits identifiable by radio frequency signals.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Most commercially produced, packaged foods (including beverages) go through a thermal process to render that particular food safe for consumption. The intensity of this thermal process varies depending on the physical characteristics and chemical composition of the food, the type of packaging, and the shelf life desired. Thermal treatment can be achieved either prior to or after filling the product into the package. For example, low acid foods where product is thermally processed prior to filling into the package can employ vastly different processing systems as compared to product that is thermally processed in-package.

To render a thermally processed food product safe for consumption, the manufacturer needs to know how much heat is applied to the product. This heat treatment can be observed as a function of temperature and time. Product temperature is heated to a certain degree and held at-least this temperature for a prescribed amount of time, thus corresponding to a “lethality” value which is conventionally used in the food industry to standardize and quantify the intensity of a thermal process. With pure liquid foods, such as beverages and broths, the temperature of the product can be measured easily by temperature probes at prescribed locations in a process system. The use of conventional temperature probes, however, is not preferred and is in practice almost impossible when temperature is desired to be measured within particulate foods (i.e., liquid foods with native constituent particles) such as soups. In these circumstances, only the liquid fraction of the particulate food can be monitored for temperature by the use of conventional temperature probes. A distinct challenge arises when temperature measurements of the different native constituent particles in the foods are desired.

In any sterilization process, the goal is to ensure commercial sterility in the product as a whole. When the product is comprised of a homogeneous liquid fraction, measurement can be facilitated by use of conventional temperature probes. On the contrary, when the product is comprised of several different particles suspended in a liquid fraction, such as in a garnished soup, it can be extremely difficult to predict sterility in the product as a whole based on the process data that is readily available in a conventional continuous flow sterilization system. The difficulty arises from the fact that different particle types in the product may heat up differently from the liquid stream, thus abrogating the utility and veracity of temperature probe measurements of the liquid faction as an indicator of particle temperature. Particle residence time distribution in the process system adds to the complexity of ensuring commercial sterility of all components.

Batch blending of products in a kettle or ribbon blender, for example, for soup products containing large particulates, can result in particle distribution issues for several reasons, including insufficient blending time, inappropriate agitator design, inappropriate agitator speed or direction, kettle size and shape, garnish level and size, overall liquid amount, particle density, and liquid viscosity. It can, therefore, be difficult to measure a variety of process conditions of interest such as, for example, the direction, orientation, speed, or temperature of a particle in a mixing vessel. Indeed, direct particle temperature measurement using conventional techniques, such as temperature probes, would be significantly challenged, if at all possible, by the movement of particles during such unit operation. It is, therefore, desirable to further optimize such batch process conditions.

Generally speaking, the temperature of a single particle may not be uniform throughout the whole volume of that particle. For example, the outer surface of the particle can heat faster than the core of the particle because the outer surface of the particle is in direct contact with the liquid fraction. Although this is the case for some conventional operations, where either hot water or steam is used as the heating medium, it may not be the case for thermal operations where the food is heated by other means such as infra-red, microwave, direct solar heating, radiation heating, inductive heating, or resistive heating. In addition to temperature variation within the volume of a single particle, different types of particles will flow at different speeds within the liquid fraction as the entire food volume is being pumped through the process system. The particles that flow faster through the system will be subject to the heat treatment for less time.

Aseptic thermal processing generally involves continuous sterilization of the food material using a suitable heat exchanger. The type of heat exchanger used is dictated by properties of the food material such as, for example, viscosity, particle size, and homogeneity. Some food products, such as juice, milk, and broth are homogeneous products and can be processed in plate heat exchangers. Other food products, such as soups having solid particles, can be processed in heat exchangers that can handle particles, such as tubular heat exchangers. To be able to quantify the thermal process for an aseptic operation, one would need to be able to identify the slowest heating particle at its core by assessing known characteristics of the particles, such as size, thermal conductivity, or density. Once the slowest heating particle has been identified, the temperature of this particle (at its coldest spot) can be known at the entrance and exit of the holding tubes associated with the heating system being used, to ensure proper thermal treatment as measured by a variety of decisional factors such as cook-value, lethality, etc. Currently, the art lacks a system that can monitor process conditions, such as direct temperature of the particles, in at least near real time during a continuous flow thermal treatment.

Food scientists and engineers have been experimenting with various technologies to quantify and validate food manufacturing processes. These conventional attempts can generally be classified in two categories, residence time distribution of different particle components and temperature data of the particle components at critical locations in the system.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,282 to Grabowski et al., for example, discloses the use of implanted radio frequency transponders (in the form of RFID chips) to identify the residence times of simulated particles passing through a continuous processing system. U.S. Pat. No. 5,741,979 to Arndt et al. discloses the use of dipole antenna marker implants in the particles and microwave transducer detectors to measure particle residence times. Systems such as these, however, do not provide information pertaining to the temperature of the particles of interest, and cannot provide pertinent temperature process information relating to the slowest heating, fastest moving particle(s) of a system.

Further conventional attempts have been made to either measure only temperature or both temperature and residence time of food particles in a continuous processing system. Magnetic resonance imaging thermometry, such as that disclosed by Kantt et al., “Temperature Mapping of Particles During Aseptic Processing with Magnetic Resonance Imaging”, Journal of Food Science, Volume 63, No. 2 (1998), is a non-obstructing and non-contact method, but is not sufficiently rapid enough to provide in-line real time measurement. Eight seconds were taken to image a single 64×64 cross-sectional temperature map. During this time, however, a considerable quantity of product can pass the detector unmonitored. Thus, the number of cross sections that can be observed is very limited, i.e., the detection of the initial location where the lethal thermal treatment is achieved may not be determined for all possible cases.

Other conventional methodologies, with associated shortcomings, include those implementing thermoresistive implants. One such example of this is the local magnetic temperature measurement approach disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,317 to Ghiron et al., which is directed to the use of spherical paramagnetic particles for implants and detector coils around the pipes for sensors. This approach then implements a correlation between falling magnetic field strength and temperature increase to calculate the implant temperature from the signals of three sensor coils. However, the negative correlation between the measured magnetic field and the increasing temperature employed by this approach can cause a non-conservative temperature estimation, i.e., the resulting calculation can indicate a higher temperature than is actually present in the implant. This is due to the fact that magnetic field reduction can be caused by a variety of factors other than temperature increase in the implant, such as obstruction of detection by other materials (e.g., other food particles that are present). Still further, the magnetic thermometry approach can be highly susceptible to electro-magnetic interference, thereby greatly increasing the complexity of data collection or veracity of the collected data.

Another methodology is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,112,954 to Palazoglu et al., which makes use of the change in the magnetic field strength of two or more magnets attached to each other along the same pole and which are secured in a carrier particle which emulates the properties of a real food particle. The magnets are placed in simple, forced attachment using an adhesive having a specific release temperature. When the adhesive melts, at a prescribed threshold temperature, at least one of the magnets rotates to the opposite pole, thereby creating a detectable change in the magnetic field. The location in the processing system where this change in the magnetic field is detected, for a given magnet pair, is assumed to be the location where the simulated particle temperature reaches the threshold temperature. The shortcoming of this methodology is that similar to the method disclosed by Ghiron et al., a direct temperature measurement is not provided. Rather, only an indirect indication of temperature is provided. Further, the resulting indication of temperature is simply one of being above the predetermined threshold temperature of the adhesive, rather than a direct numerical temperature value. Further, there is not a way of uniquely identifying a magnet pair when multiple magnet pairs are introduced into the system at the same time.

Therefore, there is a need in the art for systems and methods for directly monitoring the particulate temperature of thermally treated heterogeneous fluids having a plurality of constituent food particles.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, methods and apparatuses are disclosed which use application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) to provide process-related data for batch or continuous thermal treatments, such as particulate food sterilization, pasteurization, and/or preservation processes. The circuits are preferably embedded in a particle subjected to such treatment, and methods are described for providing at least near real-time process control derived from process data provided by the circuits while subjected to such treatment.

A preferred system for monitoring process conditions of a batch or continuous thermal treatment uses at least one application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) identifiable by radio frequency signal, coupled with at least one sensor capable of measuring at least one process condition. The system further has at least one transceiver capable of communication with the circuit and at least one particle embedded with the circuit. The particle passes within a heterogeneous fluid having a plurality of constituent food particles subjected to direct thermal treatment, indirect thermal treatment, or other food processing treatments. Aseptic processes or non-aseptic processes can be employed, where appropriate. The circuit-embedded particle can be an actual constituent particle or a particle that simulates any number of constituent particle properties.

Some currently preferred systems utilize a circuit placed within a native constituent particle. Other currently preferred systems utilize a circuit placed within a simulated particle for passing through the continuous processing system. Such circuits can be exposed at the surface of the particle, or can be positioned within the particle, preferably at least near the center of the particle, so that the particle emulates at least one physical, thermal, or dielectric characteristic of a native constituent particle.

Physical characteristics of interest can include, without limitation, moisture content, salt content, shape, and/or density. Dielectric properties can include, by way of example only, electric conductivity, magnetic permeability, relative dielectric constant, relative dielectric loss factor, and/or dielectric loss angle.

Other preferred methods further include a data logging system for measuring and storing information pertaining to at least one process condition, as measured by at least one circuit-embedded particle. Such data logging can be along at least a portion of the process path, at-least one discrete location along the process path, or both. Accordingly, such data logging can be continuous, intermittent or combinations of both.

Process conditions which can be measured using such a system can include, by way of example but without limitation, liquid pH, particulate temperature, liquid temperature, particulate speed, particulate location, particulate rotation, liquid speed, liquid nutrient characteristics, chemical characteristics, system pressure, particulate orientation, particulate position, and/or liquid salinity. Nutrient measurement can, for example, identify the amounts, concentrations, or ratios of sugar, protein, starch, and/or various vitamins or minerals that may be present in the liquid fraction of the heterogeneous fluid. Nutrient measurement can further include identifying the amounts, concentrations or ratios of various phytochemicals such as, but not limited to, phytosterols, carotenoids, tocotrienols, isoflavones, omega-3 fatty acids, phospholipids, nucleosides, nucleotides, glucosamine, ferulic acid, and/or coumaric acid.

Particulate or liquid temperature measurements can be made from about −40° C. to about 200° C., preferably between 100° C. to 140° C. Preferred systems can measure temperature with an accuracy of 1° C. System pressure measurements can be made up to 1 kpsi, preferably up to 150 kpsi.

Yet another preferred method of measuring process conditions uses at least one application specific integrated circuit identifiable by radio frequency signal having at least one sensor capable of measuring at least one process condition, providing the application specific integrated circuit in a heterogeneous fluid, and measuring at least one process condition as determined by the circuit at-least one location within the process system. The location lies along at least a portion of the length of the process path, at a discrete cross-section of the process path which is subject to a transceiver, or both. In this way, for example, particulate orientation, particulate position, or both, can be measured relative to the process space.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to devices for treating a surface, and more particularly a surface treating device adapted for treating stains from articles composed of fabrics and textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs, and upholstery.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Household furnishings and textile-based materials such as, for example, carpets, rugs, and upholstery, can last for many years, when properly treated. Routine vacuuming and regular cleaning helps to maintain the appearance and useful life of such materials. Occasional spills and stains do occur even in the most carefully maintained homes. Such stains are typically the result of a chemical reaction between the staining agent and the fibers and finishes of a fabric or textile-based material. Many stains can be treated with the proper method or technique.

Generally, the stain treatment process must be implemented immediately to prevent the stain from setting permanently in the material. The treatment process for the stains involves applying a stain-treating agent or a solvent for the stain, blotting the affected area with a cloth or sponge and/or tamping the stain with a spoon until the stain is treated. It is generally suggested that vigorous scrubbing and rubbing be avoided. Such action can irreparably damage or prematurely wear the material or spread the stain to a larger area or even push the stain deeper into the material. Unfortunately, consumers often fail to follow the suggestion against scrubbing or rubbing the stained material.

There are several motorized cleaning devices available marketed for removing stains entrenched in fabric and textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs and upholstery. Such devices typically include a drive train including a shaft. The shaft coupled to a bristle holder, may rotate, oscillate or reciprocate, and imparting a scrubbing or rubbing action. Accordingly, such prior art devices are not suitable for treating strains without causing some degree of damage or wear.

A number of compositions are formulated for treating stains. Consumers generally prefer stain treating compositions which contain or generate gas bubbles. One such composition is formulated from solutions of baking soda (i.e., sodium bicarbonate) and a peroxide compound (e.g., hydrogen peroxide). The peroxide component and the baking soda component chemically react to produce an effervescent action effective for treating stains. The composition does not produce potentially odorous and/or irritating chemicals that may leave a residue or rings after use. The major drawback to using peroxide/baking soda compositions is the inconvenience associated with handling multiple components. Because the two components are reactive on contact, they must be kept separate from one another during storage, and mixed in appropriate proportions immediately before application to the stain.

Accordingly, there is a need for a surface treating device that is designed to treat stains from fabric or textile-based materials such as carpets, rugs and upholstery, while avoiding the problems described above. There is a need for a surface treating device that operates in a manner consistent with accepted stain treating practices, and substantially minimizes damage or wear to the treated area of the material. There is a further need for a surface treating device capable of conveniently preparing and delivering a stain treating fluid formulated in proper amounts from one or more components to the surface of the material.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a surface treating device for treating stains from fabric and textile-based materials including carpets, rugs and upholstery. The surface treating device of the present invention is specifically designed to provide enhanced handling with minimal operational difficulties, while avoiding or at least substantially minimizing damage and wear to the material. The surface treating device includes a member adapted for engaging a surface to be treated in a manner, which enhances treatment without damage or excessive wear. A driver is operatively associated with the member, and is adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the member engages the surface in a substantially perpendicular manner (i.e., a tamping motion). The member may be in the form of a brush having a plurality of bristles. The surface treating device of the present invention is portable, hand-holdable, and simple and convenient to use. Furthermore, the surface treating device of the present invention is compact in size for easy storage and handling, and is especially suitable for consumer use.

The surface treating device of the present invention may further include a single fluid source for storing a fluid or multiple separate discrete fluid sources for storing a plurality of fluids and for combining the fluids in a convenient manner. The single or combination of fluids is delivered to the treatable material in proximity of the cleaning member. Preferably, in one embodiment of the present invention, the multiple discrete fluid sources comprise a peroxide fluid such as an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution in one, and a bicarbonate fluid such as an aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution in another. These fluid sources are maintained out of contact with one another (storage phase) until the combined fluid is used to clean a selected material. The discrete fluid sources may each be in the form of a pouch for facilitating easy replacement. The surface treating device of the present invention facilitates treatment of stains through both chemical and mechanical action. Accordingly, the surface treating device of the present invention offers a convenient self-contained comprehensive system for treating stains.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surface treating device, comprising:

a member adapted for engaging a surface to be treated;

a driver operatively associated with the member, the driver being adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the member engages the surface to be treated in a manner substantially perpendicular to the surface to be treated; and

a dispenser for delivering a fluid, drawn directly from a discrete fluid source, to the surface being treated.

In a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surface treating device, comprising:

a member having a plurality of bristles adapted for engaging a surface to be treated; and

a driver operatively associated with the member, the driver being adapted for imparting a linear reciprocating motion to the member, wherein the bristles engage the surface to be treated in a manner substantially perpendicular to the surface to be treated.

In a still further aspect of the invention, there is provided a fitment for a pouch for storing one of the fluids, comprising:

a valve portion for permitting passage of a fluid therethrough;

a fitment body housing the valve portion, the fitment body being adapted for attachment to a pouch; and

a throughhole extending laterally through the fitment body in communication with the interior of the pouch for permitting any gas present in the pouch to pass out of the pouch while at least substantially preventing passage of a liquid therethrough.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a pouch comprising:

a flexible wall defining a fluid cavity for accommodating a fluid; and

a fitment comprising:a) a valve portion for permitting passage of a fluid therethrough from the fluid cavity;b) a fitment body housing the valve portion, the fitment body being adapted for attachment through the flexible wall of the pouch; andc) a throughhole extending laterally through the fitment body in communication with the fluid cavity for permitting any gas present in the pouch to pass out of the pouch while at least substantially preventing passage of a liquid therethrough.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a plug comprising:

a tubular body having first and second ends, the first end configured for engaging a throughhole extending laterally through a fitment;

a laterally inclined opening located at the second end of the tubular body; and

a gas permeable membrane sealing the laterally inclined opening.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Perfume is an important component of modern fabric softeners, particularly those delivered through the rinse cycle of a washing machine and those present in dryer sheets and other forms. It is estimated that the cost of perfume may represent about 50% of the overall formula cost of a typical rinse cycle fabric softener. However, there is often a high volume of wasted perfume in the laundry process; instrumental measurements have indicated that about 50 to 70% of the perfume ingredients in a commercial liquid fabric softener typically remain in the washing liquor, and thus are never deposited on the fabrics being treated.

Consequently, increasing perfume deposition efficiency onto fabrics is desirable because it may allow for a significant decrease in waste and cost of a commercial fabric softening product. Furthermore, by improving the deposition efficiency of the volatile ingredients in a perfume, new perfume notes can be introduced into fabric softening compositions and more effectively deposited onto treated fabrics.

In laundry products such as fabric softeners, the presence of a perfume is intended to make the compositions more aesthetically pleasing to consumers. Apart from the point of purchase perception, the perfume additives may impart a pleasant and longer lasting fragrance to fabrics that are treated therewith. However, as noted above, with regard to liquid fabric softening compositions that are added during the laundry process, the major portion of the perfume is often lost in the wash solution during the wash and therefore wasted.

Attempts have been made in the art to increase the efficiency and deposition of perfumes on fabrics. For example, the use of cross-linked cationic vinyl polymers has been discussed and explored in conjunction with fabric conditioning formulations and personal care compositions as a thickening agent, for example in International Patent Publication No. WO 90/12862 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,345. Various methods for achieving controlled active release have been developed. One of the simplest of such embodiments is described in Canadian Patent No. 1,111,616 to Young, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,042,792 to Shefer et al., which describe incorporation of perfumes into wax. U.S. Pat. No. 4,464,271 describes encapsulation technology for entrapping softener compositions and fragrance oils in solid particles. An example of such microencapsulation technology is embodied in capsules with perfume, which are broken under friction to provide an instant “burst” of fragrance when the capsules are ruptured.

These types of capsules may behave differently depending on the compositions with which they are used. In particular, they may be disadvantageous in that they can often leak in aqueous compositions containing high levels of surfactants and lower alcohols. As it is desirable to provide perfumed articles that are stable in fluid compositions but still liberate perfume during use, different approaches have been used; for example, building a coating around the particles as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,137,646, or encapsulating perfume materials together with high C log P solvents to enable the fragrances to remain in the capsules for extended times without leaching from the capsules, as described in European Patent Publication No. 1 533 364 A3. However, there is an ongoing need for the improvement of perfume efficiency and deposition on fabrics and the capture of the more volatile ingredients of a perfume for fabric deposition.

The present invention is directed, in certain embodiments, to a cross-linked polymeric material designed as a perfume “sponge” to retain volatile perfume ingredients. In certain embodiments, the invention is directed to a polymeric material capable of increasing the efficiency of perfume deposition on fabrics such as cotton when used in conjunction with a rinse cycle fabric softening composition.

"This invention relates to a dentifrice and more particularly to a dentifrice containing rapidly water hydratable film flakes suspended in the dentifrice composition which impart to the dentifrice decorative, cosmetic and therapeutic benefits.

Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. In many cases ornamental effects have been used to distinguish particular products in the marketplace and identify products having particular distinct properties. In the dentifrice field, substantially clear dentifrice products such as toothpastes and gels which have incorporated therein contrasting colored flakes are known. Such flakes provide an aesthetic effect which the consumer finds pleasing and promotes the use of the dentifrice, particularly by children. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products so as to encourage the use of dentifrices in practicing oral hygiene.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dentifrice having suspended therein flakes of a water hydratable film (hereinafter film flakes) comprised of a homogeneous mixture of a water soluble hydroxyalkyl cellulose polymer and starch, the film matrix having entrained therein an agent selected from therapeutic, cosmetic and decorative agents.

In one embodiment of the invention there is provided an aesthetically decorative dentifrice having distributed throughout film flakes in which a decorative colorant is entrained in the film matrix, the dentifrice vehicle being substantially clear so that the aesthetically decorative effect can be viewed by the user.

In a second embodiment, therapeutic agents such as antibacterial agents and fluoride anticaries salts, are entrained in the film flake matrix.

In a third embodiment cosmetic agents such as sweetening agents, breath freshening agents, are entrained in the film flake matrix which flavorants are rapidly released as the flakes disintegrate during toothbrushing, delivering a pleasing burst of sweetness or breath freshening flavor into the oral cavity.

The entrainment of the therapeutic and cosmetic agents in the film flake matrix suspended in the dentifrice isolates these agents from interaction with reactive ingredients present in the dentifrice so that the agents are maintained substantially separate from the reactive dentifrice ingredients during manufacture and storage while subsequently being released from the film matrix when the dentifrice containing the film flakes is topically applied to the tooth surface as by tooth brushing.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, in particular, to a toothbrush with a powered head having fixed and movable tuft blocks.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which tooth cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the tooth cleaning elements are attached.

Conventional toothbrushes have tooth cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the tooth cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the tooth cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

It would be desirable to provide a powered toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The principles of the invention may be used to provide a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In accordance with a first aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. At least one fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to each fixed tuft block and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block with respect to each fixed tuft block

In accordance with another aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and is spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first fixed tuft block and the second fixed tuft block by an elastomeric member. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner with respect to the first and second fixed tuft blocks.

In accordance with a further aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to a distal end of the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to a proximate end of the head in a fixed orientation and spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first tuft block and the second tuft block by an elastomeric membrane and has a base portion including a slot. A battery is mounted inside the handle, and a motor is operably connected to the battery. A drive shaft is rotatably driven by the motor and has an offset portion that engages the slot in the movable tuft block to drive the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner.

Substantial advantage is achieved by providing a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In particular, certain embodiments improve cleaning of teeth and gums, and provide improved access to and contact with areas of the teeth located at a distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between the teeth.

These and additional features and advantages disclosed here will be further understood from the following detailed disclosure of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Stannous salts such as stannous fluoride are used in dentifrices as agents for preventing plaque. However, some disadvantages of stannous salts include instability, tendency to stain teeth, astringency and unpleasant taste for users. For that reason, oral care compositions containing stannous salts such as stannous fluoride are often presented as dual phase compositions, in which the stannous salt is kept separate from the other components in order to reduce its negative effects on the oral cavity, such as astringency and unpleasant taste. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,216 and U.S. Pat. No. 7,063,833, both to Glandorf et al.

Sodium tripolyphosphate is an effective anticalculus (anti-tartar) agent, but the compound is not generally compatible with stannous salts in long term storage (such as that normally sustained in the lifetime of a tube of toothpaste between time of packaging and time of discard after use). In particular, the combination of sodium tripolyphosphate with stannous salts such as stannous fluoride can lead to undesirable stannous tripolyphosphate intermediates.

Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for oral care compositions that have improved efficacy in combating plaque and tooth discoloration and are still able to retain long-term stability.

"This invention relates to a dental tray and formulation for tooth whitening. More particularly this invention relates to a substantially non-water soluble tooth whitening formulation in a dental try and its use for tooth whitening.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There is a general desire for people to have white teeth. Such white teeth are an indication of good health and in particular good oral care health. A problem is that various foods and the use of tobacco will discolor teeth. Beverages such as coffee, tea and cola beverages can discolor teeth.

As a result various products and procedures have been developed to whiten teeth. These products and procedures are either purchased and/or used directly by the consumer or are applied by a dentist or other professional. The more effective products and procedures are those that are performed by a dental professional.

Typically this consists of the dental professional forming a dental tray from an impression of a person's teeth. The dental tray is formed by any of the well known and well used procedures. After the dental tray is formed to the structure of the teeth a whitening formulation is placed in the tray and the tray placed into the mouth and against the teeth to be treated. The tray with the whitening composition in home use typically is left in the mouth for from about 10 minutes to several hours; i.e. up to 12 or more hours. If the treatment is only in the dental office the time of the treatment typically will be from about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours.

The products used solely by consumers primarily comprise whitening strips and brush-on products. Whitening strips are plastic strips with the whitening formulation on one surface. The surface with the whitening formulation is pressed against one's teeth and left in contact with the teeth for about 30 minutes. The plastic strip then is removed. The brush-on products are painted onto teeth and the user keeps his/her mouth at least partially open for up to about a minute until the formulation dries onto the teeth. In both cases saliva will dilute and flush the tooth whitening composition from the user's teeth. This is more so with strips since foreign materials, such as a plastic strip, will enhance saliva flow in the mouth. These are useful products to remove some tooth staining. However, they are not as effective as the use of dental trays, and in particular the use of dental trays by dental professionals.

A problem with the various whitening compositions that are used in dental trays is that they are substantially soluble in water and saliva. This results in a dilution of the whitening formulation during use. In order to overcome this problem producers of these whitening formulations have increased the concentration of the whitening actives. However, this causes a problem of increased tooth sensitivity, gum irritation and the potential long term for lesions. Another solution disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,058 has been to use higher viscosity tooth whitening compositions. This increases dilution time and flush time but is not a full solution to the problem. A better solution to this problem is to use a carrier and actives that are substantially insoluble in water and saliva, the carrier being about fully insoluble in water and saliva. The active must have some solubility in order to attack and remove tooth stains. However this should be at a low level. In this way tooth whitening compositions with a lower concentration of active can be used to enhance whitening through a longer contact time at a more sustained active concentration.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The dental tray can be formed from essentially any thermoplastic or thermoset polymer. The only requirement is that preferably it should be at least partially flexible to better fit into the mouth and against the teeth to be treated with the tooth whitening composition. The tooth whitening composition to be placed into the dental tray will be a substantially non-water and non-saliva soluble composition. The major components of this tooth whitening composition will comprise a non-aqueous hydrophobic polymer and a peroxide whitening agent; and optionally components such as an adhesive enhancing agent, surfactant, flavor and peroxide activator. Other optional materials such as substances with antiseptic and medicinal properties also can be a part of the tooth whitening composition. This tooth whitening composition will have a viscosity of about 50,000 cps to about 900,000 cps, and preferably about 200,000 cps to about 600,000 cps.

This tooth whitening composition is placed in the dental tray and the dental tray applied to the teeth to be treated. The tray is left in place for about 0.25 hour to about 4 hours and preferably from about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours. After removal the person may rinse his/her mouth.

After the treatment with the tooth whitening composition the teeth can be treated with a tooth desensitizing formulation. This can be via use of the tray for more severe conditions to the use of a desensitizing toothpaste for several days. Such formulations will contain potassium nitrate, citric acid, citric acid salts, strontium chloride and the like. A process of a first step tooth whitening procedure followed by a tooth desensitizing procedure is preferred for persons who are susceptible to tooth sensitivity problems.

Oral care materials are applied in different ways. A common technique is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add an oral care material to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. When the oral care material is a whitening agent, the teeth gradually whiten after a few treatments. Another technique is to use an oral care strip that has an oral care material on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. When the oral care material is a whitening agent, the teeth are gradually whitened after several applications. Yet another technique is to apply oral care materials to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container or bottle during the application of the oral care material to ones teeth. When the oral care material is a whitening agent, the teeth gradually whiten after a few treatments.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalyze the decomposition of certain oral care materials, such as peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of the oral care material and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the oral care material, such as peroxide, in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with certain oral care materials, such as anhydrous whitening compositions. In such situations, the brush may transport moisture in saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative affect on the oral care material, such as whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the oral care system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

These problems require a better way to deliver an oral care material to the oral surface and a more convenient oral care system for transport and/or travel.

SUMMARY

The present invention is directed to an oral care system that utilizes an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, having a dispenser containing an oral care material that is mounted to the handle of the toothbrush. In one preferred embodiment, the dispenser is pivotably mounted to the handle of the oral care implement and can be pivoted between: (i) a storage state wherein an applicator or dispensing end of the dispenser is nested within the handle; and (ii) an application state wherein the applicator or dispensing end is exposed for oral care use. The dispenser is preferably designed so as to blend into the handle and form a portion of the handle, thereby forming a handle that is shaped like a typical handle for an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush handle.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque is a biofilm that adheres to tooth and other oral surfaces, particularly at the gingival margin. Dental plaque is cohesive and highly resistant to removal from teeth and/or oral surfaces. Dental plaque comprises glucans, which are insoluble polysaccharides that provide plaque with its cohesive properties. The bacterial enzyme glucosyltransferase converts dietary sugar into glucans. Plaque mineralizes to form a hard deposit called calculus, which becomes a local irritant for the gums, causing gingivitis.

Current treatments for removing and preventing plaque build-up include brushing the teeth with an abrasive and/or antibacterial toothpaste, flossing, and various other treatments. The effectiveness of such treatments depends on a variety of factors including the amount of plaque present. While current techniques for removing and preventing plaque buildup on the teeth and oral tissues are suitable for their intended uses, they are subject to improvement.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides oral care compositions. Embodiments include oral compositions comprising: aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamelliaand an enhancing agent.

The present invention still further provides for a method of using an oral composition for removing dental plaque and/or inhibiting deposition of dental plaque within an oral cavity. The oral composition comprises aCamelliaextract of semi-oxidized tissue from a member of the genusCamelliaand an enhancing agent.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to ansate oral care implements, and specifically to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, with multiple cleaners for treating soft oral tissues.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be bad breath or oral malodor.

While bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers are inadequate in respect to their effectiveness on the soft tissue surface of the tongue. Broad flat scraping blades are limited in their ability to reach between the papillae where the bacteria and microdebris have collected. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Recently, substantial efforts have been expended to develop oral care implements having improved soft tissue cleaners. An example of such an oral care implement has a tissue cleaner in the form of a pad composed of an elastomeric material. The pad is disposed on the head on a surface opposite the tooth cleaning elements. The pad includes a plurality of conically shaped nubs extending therefrom for cleaning between the papillae of the tongue. While this oral care implement provides a substantial improvement over the then existing tongue cleaners, it is somewhat limited in that the pad of elastomeric material is provided on only one major surface of the head. Therefore, the soft tissue pad cannot reach into tight spaces and recesses within the oral cavity.

A further improvement of oral care implements incorporating soft tissue cleansing technology has a head having a single elastomeric soft tissue cleaner applied to the major rear surface of the head that also extends along the side walls of the head. This arrangement allows the soft tissue cleaners to act on the user's gums during brushing.

A limiting factor in versatility of the soft tissue cleaner on the head of oral care implements, thus far, has been the inability to cost-effectively manufacture isolated multiple components on the head. This is in part due to the parametric requirements of existing injection molding equipment and processes.

Despite the aforementioned and other improvements, a need still exists for an oral care implement with a soft tissue cleaner that can provide effective removal of bacteria from the tongue and other oral soft tissue regions while maintaining comfort to the user.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleaner that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on oral tissue surfaces. The invention is an oral care implement comprising multiple types of soft tissue cleaners that offer expanded cleaning and/or in-mouth sensations during an oral care session.

In one particular aspect, the invention may be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle, the head having a first surface, an opposite second surface, and a peripheral surface extending between the first and second surfaces; a first cleaner for cleansing soft oral tissue, the first cleaner formed of a resilient material and fixed to the head; and a second cleaner for cleansing soft oral tissue, the second cleaner formed of a resilient material and fixed to the head. In one embodiment, a third cleaner can be included that is formed of a resilient material and fixed to the head

The first and second (and possibly third) cleaners are constructed of resilient material having different densities, hardness, colors and/or materials that cause different trigeminal sensory responses in the user, by incorporating, for example, different flavoring agents and/or sensates. In still another preferred embodiment, the first and second (and possibly third) cleaners are fixed to and cover different zones of the head. In this embodiment, it is further preferred that the first and second (and possibly third) cleaners comprise different topographies. The first and second (and possibly third) cleaners may be molded to the head separately. One or more of the aforementioned preferred characteristics may be combined in certain embodiments of the invention.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle, the head having a structural body having a front surface and a rear surface opposite the front surface; a basin formed into the rear surface of the structural body, the structural body comprising a protuberance extending upward from a recessed floor of the annular basin, the basin surrounding the protuberance; a first cleaner formed of a resilient material for cleansing soft oral tissue located within the basin, the protuberance of the structural body extending through a central hole of the first cleaner; and a second cleaner formed of a resilient material for cleansing soft oral tissue, the second cleaner located on the protuberance of the structural body.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle, the head having a first surface, an opposite second surface, and a peripheral surface extending between the first and second surfaces; a first cleaner formed of a resilient material for cleansing soft oral tissue, the first cleaner being a pad having a hole that is fixed to the first surface of the head; a second cleaner formed of a resilient material for cleansing soft oral tissue, the second cleaner being an elongated strip fixed to the head along the peripheral surface of the head; and a third cleaner formed of a resilient material for cleansing soft oral tissue, the third cleaner being a structure that is fixed to a portion of the first surface of the head that is exposed through the central hole of the first cleaner.

In still another aspect, the invention can be an apparatus for cleansing soft oral tissue comprising: a plurality of elastomeric rings arranged in an aligned and separated manner along an axis; and for each pair of adjacent elastomeric rings, an elastomeric wall extending along the axis and connecting the adjacent elastomeric rings. In a further aspect, the invention can be a method of manufacturing a head of an oral care implement comprising: a) forming a structural body of the head out of a hard plastic, the main structural body having a front surface, a rear surface, a basin formed into the rear surface, and a protuberance extending upward from a recessed floor of the basin, the basin surrounding the protuberance; b) injecting a first shot of thermoplastic elastomer via a first port into the basin of the structural body of the head to form a first cleaner for cleansing soft oral tissue; and c) injecting a second shot of a thermoplastic elastomer via a second port onto the protuberance of the structural body of the head to form a second cleaner for cleansing soft oral tissue.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Consumers report perceptions of refreshment, contentment, cleanliness, and general well-being similar to those experienced post-spa or beauty treatment after a professional teeth cleaning carried out by a dentist or hygienist. Thus, there is a need in the art for an at-home oral care regiment that permits consumers to re-create the “extra clean” mouth feel and associated sense of well-being experienced after a professional teeth cleaning.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention includes methods of cleaning an oral surface, maintaining oral health and/or increasing oral health. Such methods encompass contacting an oral surface with a primary oral care composition at least once daily, and contacting the oral surface with a periodic oral care composition at least once within a period of about 42 days. The periodic oral care compositions suitable for use in the method comprise a first abrasive having an Einlehner hardness of greater than about 5 mg loss per 100,000 revolutions and a second abrasive having an Einlehner hardness of less than about 5 mg loss per 100,000 revolutions. In the periodic oral care compositions, the ratio of the first abrasive to the second abrasive is about 1:1.6 to about 1.6:1. The periodic oral care compositions are characterized by a pellicle cleaning ratio of greater than about 100 and a radioactive dentin abrasion of less than about 200. Additionally or alternatively, the methods may include those where the second abrasive comprises silica and has an oil of absorption of greater than about 90 cm3/100 g and/or an Einlehner hardness of less than about 5 mg loss per 100,000 revolutions. The ratio of the first abrasive to the second abrasive may be about 1:1.6 to about 1.6:1. The total amount of the first and second abrasives present in the oral composition may be greater than about 25% by weight of the composition and/or the oral composition has a pellicle cleaning ratio of greater than about 100 and a radioactive dentin abrasion of less than about 200.

"BACKGROUND

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with a customizable element. Individuals exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth or perform interdental cleaning of their teeth. Such habits may be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a customizable element.

In one aspect, an oral care implement, with an oral care region having cleaning elements for engaging oral tissue and a body for gripping the implement including a handle with a front and a removable faceplate is described. The removable faceplate may be transparent or translucent and may also include design features. The faceplate may provide protection to a user inscription surface on one of the surfaces of the handle which may be configured to receive user indicia that may later be removed and further indicia provide.

In another aspect, a motorized electric oral care implement, with an oral care region having cleaning elements for engaging oral tissue, a body for gripping the implement including a handle having a removable faceplate, and an electric power source, such that the faceplate is electrically coupled to the electrical power source when the faceplate is in an attached state is described.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries is a major dental disease that affects the majority of the population. In the early part of the 20th century, investigators discovered that fluoride was effective in reducing the incidence of caries. Since that time, fluoride research has developed, and it is now well accepted that fluoride treatments benefit dental health.

Fluoride compositions are routinely applied to teeth by any number of methods and compositions, the most common methods by utilizing fluoride containing dentifrice compositions, such as toothpastes and mouthwashes. However, there are certain situations where it is desirable to have prolonged contact of the fluoride compositions with teeth, and to use amounts of fluoride that exceed fluoride amounts present in dentifrice compositions. For example, it may be desirable to treat xerostomia (dry mouth), tooth hypersensitivity, dental caries with high levels of fluoride for prolonged periods of time. This may be accomplished by the use of a dental tray, wherein a composition is applied to the dental tray, and then the composition and tray are applied to the teeth to be treated; however, this method is inconvenient, as the user is forced to retain the tray in their mouth during use, and thus the treatment time is limited by how long the user may retain the tray in their mouth. Thus, tooth varnish compositions have been developed to be applied directly to the tooth with a brush. The use of tooth varnish compositions are well known in the art, and the varnish compositions allow for a longer exposure time (e.g., about or greater than 2 hours) before the composition is worn away.

Existing tooth varnish compositions generally contain an active component, e.g., to treat caries, provide fluoride therapy, treat xerostomia, tooth sensitivity, and/or whiten or bleach teeth, and an adhesive film forming component to cause the active material to adhere to the tooth. However, due to the colour of the adhesive film forming component, the varnish may cause a temporary change in the surface colour of teeth, e.g., creating a yellow color. A color difference may be desirable in that it aids the user in identifying tooth surfaces on which the varnish has been applied; however, excessive color is undesirable, as yellow teeth suggest an unhygienic oral cavity, regardless of how temporary the varnish is. Additionally, the discoloration may cause embarrassment to the user, as others may realize that the user is utilizing a tooth varnish. Thus, there is a need to develop tooth varnish compositions which do not adversely affect the colour of a tooth.

Another disadvantage with tooth varnishes is that the varnishes tend to be multiphase, e.g., as the active component is insoluble in the adhesive film forming phase, and the varnish may separate out into distinct phases. Additionally, components of the adhesive film forming phase, may also separate into distinct phases over time. Users typically need to stir the varnish in order to mix the phases, which is time consuming and wasteful, as the varnish adheres to the mixing apparatus and is then discarded. Thus, there exists a need to develop tooth varnish compositions with greater stability, wherein the phases do not readily separate.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, it has been surprisingly discovered that a tooth varnish comprising an active component, and an adhesive film forming component comprising shellac wax and a bleached shellac imparts less color when applied to a tooth, and has greater stability, e.g., the phases tend not to separate; moreover, the use of such compositions does not cause a reduction of activity of the active component. The varnish may be easily applied by brush, e.g., dipping a brush into the composition, and then applying it to a tooth surface, preferably a dry tooth surface. The varnish is temporary, and wears off of the tooth surface after a period of time, e.g., within 48 hours of application, within 24 hours of application, within 12 hours of application, within 6 hours of application, or within 2 hours of application.

Thus, the present invention is directed to composition 1.0, an oral composition comprising an active component, and adhesive film forming component comprising a bleached shellac and shellac wax.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

This application is a National Stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Application No. PCT/US2007/087351, filed Dec. 13, 2007, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

This invention relates to a pump head for a dispensing pump where the pump head contains a fragrance. More particularly the invention relates to the structure for a fragrance dispensing pump head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are many devices for delivering a fragrance to a room or other space. Many of these are designed solely to deliver a fragrance. These range from potpourri, scented candles and units that utilize an electrical source. There also are fragrance units that are a part of another article. These other articles can be bottles and other containers such as are set out in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,165,603 and 6,769,631. Each of these patents discloses having a fragrance dispensing unit attached to the upper or the lower part of a container. U.S. Pat. No. 4,341,348 discloses an aerosol container with a fragrance dispensing unit attached to the top part of the aerosol container. U.S. Pat. No. 3,955,706 discloses a fragrance unit that can be adhesively attached to the inside of a waste container. A fragrance unit can also be a part of the closure for a container. Such closures are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,131,975; 4,858,758 and 6,394,264. However, there is no disclosure of a structure whereby the fragrance is incorporated into a dispensing pump unit, such as a palm top pump unit. Containers that utilize palm top pumps are used mainly in the bathroom and in the kitchen. These are two areas where fragrances are useful in maintaining a fresh scent environment. Further since the fragrance unit would be a part of the dispenser pump that is in motion during use, there is an induced flow of air through the dispensing pump head during each dispensing which aids in the flow of the fragrance into the room.

Except for units that are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,769,631, the prior art units where the fragrance is a part of the container are of the passive type. The fragrance is dispensed into a room solely by the convection of the air in the room. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,769,631 there is disclosed a base unit which is actuated during a dispensing to assist in the flow of the fragrance from the base unit. However, this requires a costly unit to be added to the container. The dispensing unit of this application has a dynamic flow of air through the fragrance unit when a part of the contents of the container are dispensed, but requires no additional physical structure to the container or to the pump for the dynamic flow. The pump actuator functions to dispense product from the container and in addition as the holder and the dynamic dispenser for a fragrance. Optionally the dispenser pump also can have a passive fragrance delivery section. This present dispensing pump is a cost effective way to deliver a fragrance to a kitchen or a bathroom.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a dispensing pump that functions to dispense a first product from a container and which also emits a volatile substance such as a fragrance as a second product. In addition, the invention is directed to such a dispensing pump in combination with a container. The dispensing pump is comprised of a pump head, a pump mechanism, a dip tube and a closure which attaches the dispensing pump to the container. The pump head is on one end of the pump mechanism and the dip tube on the other end of the pump mechanism. The container closure usually is associated with the pump head and attaches and seals the assembly of the pump head, dip tube and pump mechanism to the container.

The pump head is comprised of an upper portion and a lower portion. The upper portion has an actuator top surface to be contacted by a person's hand to actuate the pump mechanism and dispense a first product from the container. The lower portion usually includes the pump mechanism and the container closure. Either the upper portion or the lower portion, or both, have an internal area for containing the second product, which preferably is a fragrance. There is a first product dispensing channel extending through the internal area of the pump head to the pump mechanism and dip tube at one end and to an exit to the exterior at a second end. This dispensing channel flows the first product from the container through the pump mechanism and pump head to the exterior. The pump mechanism receives the first product from the container through the dip tube. The upper portion internal area has a top wall actuator surface, and an upper portion peripheral sidewall depending downwardly from the top wall. The lower portion internal area has a lower portion bottom wall and a lower portion peripheral sidewall extending upwardly from the bottom wall. The upper portion internal area and the lower portion internal area combine to form an enclosed space. The upper portion peripheral sidewall and the lower portion peripheral sidewall can overlap, but with a space between the peripheral sidewalls. Upon depressing the upper portion actuator surface the first product is dispensed from the container and the second product from the upper portion internal area and/or the lower portion internal area through the space between the peripheral sidewalls, and optionally through apertures that may be provided in the peripheral sidewalls. After an initial use, and when not dispensing the first product, some second product will flow to the exterior through the space between the upper portion peripheral sidewall and the lower portion peripheral sidewall and through any optional peripheral sidewall apertures that may be provided. The lower portion also may have one or more auxiliary areas for containing additional second product. These auxiliary areas can have apertures through which the second product is released to the exterior and/or it can be released to the lower portion internal area and from the lower portion internal area.

In the embodiment where either, or both, the upper portion peripheral sidewall and the lower peripheral sidewall have one or more apertures the dispensing of the second product will be accelerated when the first product is being dispensed from the container by the flow of the second product also through the apertures. After a dispensing of the first product there will be a flow of the second product through the space between the sidewalls and through the apertures for a passive delivery of the second product.

The pump head upper portion internal area and lower portion internal area will be of a size and shape to accommodate the second product, which preferably is a fragrance. These internal areas preferably will be cylindrical, in a generally circular, oval or multi-sided shape. The auxiliary areas will be areas available in the structure of the lower portion. The second product preferably will be a solid or a semi-solid fragrance or a fragrance adsorbed or absorbed onto or into a solid material which can be an organic or an inorganic material. It also can comprise bead-like particles. The second product can be located above and/or below the dispenser spout channel that delivers the first product to the exterior for use.

"FIELD

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement including a capillary delivery system for a flowable substance, such as an oral care fluid.

BACKGROUND

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristle section followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums. Some toothbrushes have been equipped with fluid reservoirs and systems for delivering oral care agents, such as whitening agents, breath freshening agents, and the like. There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements for delivering auxiliary oral care fluids.

BRIEF SUMMARY

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a capillary delivery system. Optionally, the oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements on a first surface thereof.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a reservoir containing at least one flowable substance. A variety of flowable substances can be administered for therapeutic, hygienic, and/or other oral care benefits, such as fresh breath, tooth whitening, or producing sensations of heat, cool, or tingling.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement includes a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the flowable substance to one or more outlets. In one embodiment, an outlet is located on a second surface of the head generally opposite the first surface that contains the tooth cleaning elements.

In yet another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir for storing a flowable substance, and an overflow chamber. The reservoir and overflow chamber may be separated by a partition. A capillary channel constructed from a fibrous material, ceramic, porous plastic, or combination thereof extends through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the flowable substance to one or more outlets.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir containing at least one flowable substance, a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the flowable substance to one or more outlets, and a motion-producing device. When activated, the motion-producing device vibrates the implement or a portion thereof, such as the head portion. The vibration enhances the function of the tooth cleaning elements and also promotes delivery of the flowable substance through the capillary channel, which together provides an enhanced cleaning action.

According to another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided including a handle for grasping, a head including at least one tooth cleaning element, a reservoir for storing a flowable substance, at least one outlet disposed on the head, and a capillary channel fluidly coupling the reservoir to the outlet. In some embodiments, the capillary channel further includes a first wicking member formed of a wicking material and defining a first flow section, a second wicking member formed of a wicking material and defining a second flow section. The second wicking member is fluidly coupled to the first wicking member and the flowable substance flows via capillary action through the first wicking member at a flow rate that is different than in the second wicking member. In some embodiments, the first and second wicking members are made of different materials having different capillarities.

According to another aspect of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that includes a handle for grasping, a head including at least one tooth cleaning element, a reservoir for storing a flowable substance, at least one outlet disposed on the head, and a capillary channel fluidly coupling the reservoir to the outlet. The capillary channel further includes a first wicking member formed of a wicking material and defining a first flow section, a second wicking member formed of a wicking material and defining a second flow section. The second wicking member is fluidly coupled to the first wicking member and the flowable substance flows via capillary action from the first wicking member to the second wicking members through a flow restrictor at a reduced rate of flow that is smaller than a rate of flow through the first or second wicking members. In one embodiment, the flow restrictor is a reduced cross-sectional flow area disposed between the first and second wicking members that is operative to reduce the flow therebetween. In some embodiments, the flow restrictor may be a notched area formed between the first and second wicking members. The first and second wicking members may be a unitary member or separate members fluid coupled together.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to multi-component toothbrushes having enhanced visual and/or scenting effects resulting from the properties (e.g., transparency) and structural configuration (e.g., use of a base component having projections) of the toothbrush components.

Toothbrushes are often constructed from multiple components having dissimilar properties in terms of hardness, texture, color, etc. to provide an overall product possessing a number of desired features, such as ease of gripping, good bending/flexibility characteristics, and high durability. However, the domain of possible combinations of components which can be combined using straightforward manufacturing techniques is limited by component compatibility, which in turn depends upon the individual component compositions. Thus, while the incorporation of aesthetic features (e.g., three-dimensional effects) and even scenting agents in toothbrushes may be desired to improve product appeal to the user, the components required to obtain these properties often cannot be easily combined in an efficient and/or low-cost manner. For example, combining transparent and opaque plastics can require the use of chemical adhesives or bonding agents for acceptable adherence of these components.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Aspects of the invention relate to toothbrushes constructed of at least two components such as injection molded plastics having distinct optical properties (e.g., transparency). In representative embodiments, the components are chemically compatible such that they can be acceptably adhered to one other without an adhesive.

The components combine to provide visual effects such as the appearance of three-dimensional features (e.g., projections) in a base component at varying depths beneath an overlying (or covering) transparent or partially transparent second component. For example, if the second component is only partially transparent, then its use to cover projection surfaces of a base component at varying thicknesses will result in varying degrees of visibility of these surfaces. Projection surfaces covered by a relatively thick layer of partially transparent plastic component may be only faintly visible compared to projection surfaces covered by a relatively thin layer (or otherwise not covered at all, i.e., protruding through the partially transparent plastic component). If desired, underlying surfaces of the base component may be essentially completely obscured, causing the projection surfaces to appear suspended in the partially transparent second component.

This variability in the extent to which features of the base component may be visually concealed or exposed is also applicable with respect to other sensory effects associated with the base component. For example, the release of a scenting agent from the base component may be similarly varied, such that the base component surfaces (areas or points) covered by a relatively thick layer of a second component (e.g., partially transparent plastic) will release scenting agent in the base component at a relatively lower rate compared to surfaces that are covered by only a thin layer or possibly completely exposed to the toothbrush exterior. The rate of scenting agent release per unit area depends on the diffusion kinetics of the scenting agent through any overlying second component, which often will not contain any scenting agent.

In alternative embodiments, second components or other toothbrush components may contain scenting agents at the same, a lower, or a higher concentration, relative to the base component. In any event, it will be appreciated from the present disclosure how varying component thicknesses and scenting concentrations can be used to vary and control the release of scenting agent from different portions of the toothbrush surface exterior (e.g., portions of the handle).

Aspects of the invention therefore relate to a toothbrush comprising a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region. A second component covers at least a portion of the base component in the gripping region. The base component includes a plurality of projections in the gripping region, and the second component is at least partially transparent and covers the base component at more than one thickness.

Further aspects of the invention relate to a toothbrush, as discussed above, comprising a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region and a second component covering a portion of the base component in the gripping region. The base component and the second component are chemically compatible, such that the components can adhere to a satisfactory degree without the use of a chemical adhesive, bonding agent, or even mechanical interlocking of the components.

Other aspects of the invention relate to a toothbrush comprising a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region, as discussed above. The base component comprises a scenting agent. A second component covers, at varying thicknesses, at least a portion of the base component in the gripping region, to provide varying rates of release of the scenting agent in this region.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following Detailed Description.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care dispensers and oral care systems.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to one's teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with a fluid dispenser in a highly portable and convenient housing. Advantageously, such embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush that detachably retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care system includes fluid such as fluidic oral care materials, either active or non-active agents, that may include without limitation, whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other oral care materials. The dispenser can be detachably docked and stored at least partially within the handle of the toothbrush so that a portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush, or forms a proximal end of the toothbrush handle, to permit access to a user for easy removal and use of the dispenser. The dispenser can be completely removable from the toothbrush in certain embodiments so that the user can apply the fluid to his/her teeth with ease, and then reinsert the dispenser in the toothbrush for convenient storage. In certain embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component. The toothbrush can removably and non-fixedly secure the dispenser within the handle so that the dispenser can be repetitively removed and reinserted therein. In some embodiments, the dispenser may be adapted to be user-refillable for repeated use.

In one embodiment, the invention can be an oral care dispenser comprising a housing having a longitudinal axis and an internal reservoir containing a fluid; a collar non-rotatably coupled to the housing, the collar comprising an axial passageway, a neck portion having an inner surface forming a first section of the axial passageway, a body portion forming a second section of the axial passageway, and a plurality of protuberances extending radially inward from an inner surface of the body portion, the neck portion formed by a plurality of segments that protrude axially from the body portion, wherein adjacent ones of the plurality of segments are separated by a gap; a drive component rotatably coupled to the collar, the drive component comprising a first annular flange located adjacent a distal edge of the neck portion, a drive screw extending from the first annular flange in a first axial direction, a post extending from the first annular flange in a second axial direction and through the axial passageway, and at least one resilient arm extending radially outward from the post in the second section of the axial passageway; and wherein rotation of an actuator in a first rotational direction causes: (1) an elevator to axially advance along the drive screw in the first axial direction to dispense the fluid from a dispensing orifice; and (2) the at least one resilient arm to move over the plurality of protuberances, the at least one resilient arm deforming when moving over each of the plurality of protuberances and resuming an original state upon passing each of the plurality of protuberances to generate an audible signal.

In another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care dispenser comprising: a housing having a longitudinal axis and an internal reservoir containing a fluid; a collar non-rotatably coupled to the housing, the collar comprising an inner surface forming an axial passageway, the inner surface of the collar comprising a plurality of features arranged in a circumferentially spaced-apart manner about the longitudinal axis; a drive component rotatably coupled to the collar, the drive component comprising a drive screw, a post, and one or more resilient arms extending radially outward from the post, the one or more resilient arms being curved in a second rotational direction about the longitudinal axis; wherein rotation of an actuator in a first rotational direction causes: (1) an elevator to axially advance along the drive screw in a first axial direction to dispense the fluid from a dispensing orifice; and (2) the one or more resilient arms to move over the plurality of features; and wherein interaction between the plurality of features and the one or more resilient arms prevents rotation of the actuator in the second rotational direction.

In a further embodiment, the invention can be an oral care dispenser comprising: a housing having a longitudinal axis and an internal reservoir containing a fluid; a collar non-rotatably coupled to the housing, the collar comprising an axial passageway, a segmented annular neck portion having an inner surface forming a first section of the axial passageway, a non-segmented annular body portion forming a second section of the axial passageway, and a plurality of protuberances extending radially inward from an inner surface of the non-segmented annular body portion; a drive component rotatably coupled to the collar, the drive component comprising a drive screw extending from the first annular flange in a first axial direction, a post extending from the first annular flange in a second axial direction and through the axial passageway, and at least one resilient arm extending radially outward from the post in the second section of the axial passageway; and wherein rotation of an actuator in a first rotational direction causes: (1) an'elevator to axially advance along the drive screw in the first axial direction to dispense the fluid from a dispensing orifice; and (2) the at least one resilient arm to move over the plurality of protuberances, the at least one resilient arm deforming when moving over each of the plurality of protuberances and resuming an original state upon passing each of the plurality of protuberances to generate an audible signal.

In certain exemplary embodiments, any suitable fluid may be used with embodiments and methods described herein according to the present invention. Accordingly, the oral care treatment system may be any type of system including without limitation tooth whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection/control, and others. The invention is expressly not limited to any particular type of oral care system or fluid, unless specifically claimed.

In still other embodiments, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; and one of the aforementioned oral care dispensers, wherein the dispenser is configured to be detachably coupled to the toothbrush.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"FIELD

The present invention relates generally to product packaging that displays the products contained therein, and specifically to product packaging that displays the products contained therein that includes a primary package and a secondary package.

BACKGROUND

Many products are sold in bulk packaging which contain two or more of the subject products. In many instances, it is desirable to display the subject products in an organized and aesthetically pleasing manner to potential consumers, while the products remain in the bulk packaging. Display of the products themselves at the point of sale has proven to be a significant factor that positively influences consumer reaction to and/or evaluation of a product, thus, ultimately leading to increased sales. However, the aforementioned goal of product display (especially in bulk packaging) has been limited by the desire to maintain packaging costs as low as possible. Moreover, the requirements that bulk packaging also be structurally stable and versatile in display have also presented significant hurdles in the field. It is further desirable, especially in display packaging, that the packaging be capable of both resting on a store shelf and being suspended from a peg (or similar member) that extends outwardly from a vertical support with no or minimal alteration. It is also desirable that the display packaging be easily storable by the end consumer, especially in bulk packaging in which the products may be used over an extended period of time. To this extent, it has been desired to utilize packaging that is sleek, small in size, and easily portable and/or stackable. Finally, all product packaging should have sufficient structural stability so as to prevent damage to the products (and the packaging itself) during shipping and/or handling.

SUMMARY

The present invention is directed to a display package that, in one embodiment, comprises a plurality of primary packs that contain one or more products and a sleeve. The primary packs are arranged in a bundle and disposed within the sleeve. Preferably, the display package can be stood upright or hung from a peg or other member extending from a vertical wall.

In certain embodiments, a separator panel may be provided to prevent the primary packs from decoupling from one another and/or sliding out of the sleeve. The separator panel may also add rigidity to the display package. Apertures may be provided in opposing panels of the sleeve for receiving portions of the primary packs of the bundle to further facilitate retention of the bundle within the sleeve.

In one embodiment, the invention can be a display package comprising: a plurality of packs, each pack comprising a front wall, a rear wall, and at least one interior chamber located between the front and rear walls for holding at least one product, the plurality of packs arranged in a bundle; a separator panel having at least one upper aperture and at least one lower aperture positioned between adjacent packs in the bundle, a portion of the front wall of one pack in the bundle protruding through one of the upper or lower apertures in the separator panel and contacting an adjacent pack in the bundle and a portion of the rear wall of the adjacent pack in the bundle protruding through the other one of the upper or lower apertures in the separator panel and contacting the one pack in the bundle; a sleeve comprising a front panel having a front aperture, a rear panel having a rear aperture, and first and second side panels connecting the front and rear panels to form a cavity; and the bundle positioned within the cavity of the sleeve, a portion of the front wall of a front-most pack in the bundle protruding through the front aperture of the front panel of the sleeve and a portion of the rear wall of a rear-most pack in the bundle protruding through the rear aperture of the rear panel of the sleeve.

In another embodiment, the invention can be a display package comprising: a first pack and a second pack, each of the first and second packs comprising a front wall, a rear wall, and at least one interior chamber located between the front and rear walls for holding at least one product; the first and second packs arranged in a bundle so that a protruding portion of the front wall of the second pack contacts the first pack and a protruding portion of the rear wall of the first pack contacts the second pack; a sleeve comprising a front panel having a front aperture, a rear panel having a rear aperture, and first and second side panels connecting the front and rear panels to form a cavity; and the bundle positioned within the cavity of the sleeve, a protruding portion of the front wall of the first pack protruding through the front aperture of the front panel of the sleeve and a protruding portion of the rear wall of the second pack protruding through the rear aperture of the rear panel of the sleeve

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement including a capillary delivery system for a fluid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristle section followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums. Some toothbrushes have been equipped with fluid reservoirs and systems for delivering auxiliary active agents, such as whitening agents, breath freshening agents, and the like. There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements for delivering auxiliary active agents.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a capillary delivery system. Optionally, the oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements on a first surface thereof.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a reservoir containing at least one active agent. A variety of active agents can be administered for therapeutic, hygienic, and/or other benefits, such as fresh breath, tooth whitening, or producing sensations of heat, cool, or tingling.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement includes a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets. In one embodiment, an outlet is located on a second surface of the head generally opposite the first surface that contains the tooth cleaning elements.

In yet another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir for storing a fluid containing at least one active agent, and an overflow chamber. The reservoir and overflow chamber may be separated by a partition. A capillary channel constructed from a fibrous material, ceramic, porous plastic, or combination thereof extends through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir containing at least one active agent, a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets, and a motion-producing device. When activated, the motion-producing device vibrates the implement or a portion thereof, such as the head portion. The vibration enhances the function of the tooth cleaning elements and also promotes delivery of the active agent through the capillary channel, which together provides an enhanced cleaning action.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The embodiments of the invention relate to a method of producing magnolol or its analogue compounds. The embodiments also relate to a pharmaceutically or orally acceptable composition comprising magnolol or its analogue compounds prepared according to the methods described herein.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Magnolol (5,5′-diallylbiphenyl-2,2′-diol or 5,5′-dially-2,2′-bisphenol), together with honokiol, are the major ingredients found in magnolia extracts. It is well recognized in the art that magnolia extracts have found, among other things, applications in compositions to treat bacteria and/or inflammation related oral diseases. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,544.409, and U.S. patent application publication No. U.S. 2006/0,140,885, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.



Studies have further revealed that magnolol, as an independent active substance, also plays an important role in other pharmacological processes besides its anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. For example, magnolol has been shown to exhibit a beneficial capability of protecting the myocardium against infarction and reperfusion injury. It has also been shown that magnolol protects neurons against chemical hypoxia by KCN in cortical neuron-astrocyte mixed cultures. More recently, it is reported, that magnolol possesses an antioxidant activity 1000 times greater than α-tocopherol, implicating magnolol's great potential in food and pharmaceutical applications. All these divergent uses reveal that there is a great need for high quality and affordable magnolol. See Wen-Hsin Huang et al.,The Chinese Pharmaceutical Journal,2006, 58, 115-122; Min-Min Lee et al.Chinese Journal of Physiology,2000, 43, 61-67.

Currently, there are several synthetic methods of producing magnolol reported in the art, one of which is described in a paper by J. Runeberg,Acta Chem Scand,1958, 12, 188-192, wherein the key reactant, methyl ether of 5,5′-dibromo-2,2′-bisphenol was reacted with allyl bromide in tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of ethylmagnesium bromide to obtain methyl ether of 5.5′-diallylbiphenyl-2,2-diol as shown below:



This reaction requires refluxing conditions, and provides a low yield of the desired product. Furthermore, the subsequent step of removing the methyl group of methyl ether of 5,5′-diallylbiphenyl-2,2′-diol to obtain magnolol requires even higher temperature, and the reaction mixture is difficult to separate and purify, thereby resulting in a low yield of magnolol.

Other reported synthetic methods of producing magnolol in the art also suffer similar problems such as low yields, difficulty in purification, the high cost of synthesis, and/or not practical or compatible for industrial scale. See, e.g., Wen-Hsin Huang et al.,The Chinese Pharmaceutical Journal,2006, 58, 115-122; and Wenxin On et al.,Tetrahedron: Asymmetry,1998, 9, 1377-1380. Therefore, there exists a practical need in the art to develop a synthetic method to produce high quality and affordable magnolol, as well as derivatives and analogues thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a pre-assembled cap and spout which provides for spout orientation, sealing, and locking when applied to a container. Moreover, the pre-assembled cap of the present invention is useful as a cap and spout for liquid laundry detergent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Molded thermoplastic containers have found wide application in the packaging of liquid detergents, fabric softeners, and other viscous liquid products. Conventional closures employed in such containers include anti-drip pour spouts and cooperating dosing caps. Typically, a pour spout fitment is fastened within a dispensing opening in the container and enclosed with an overlying cap which can serve as a measuring cup. Flow restrictor and drainage features are provided in the fitment by provision of inclined base members in the fitment which include openings that communicate with the container interior.

Conventional dispenser closures used for pouring the container contents often consist of three components, an inner sleeve which is friction-fit to the inside of the neck of the container, a spout portion which is normally snap-fit into the sleeve so that the spout projects vertically beyond the upper margins of the sleeve and the container neck, and a cap portion which is threaded onto the neck and may often serve as a measuring cup. This type of closure is commonly used for containers of liquid household laundry detergent and related products, although the closure of the invention is not restricted to any specific type of application.

For example, Davidson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,108,009 discloses a package having a spout-containing fitment wherein external threads on the package finish cooperate with internal threads on a closure/measuring cup. The Davidson et al. bottle includes a locking circumferential ridge on an inner peripheral surface of the upper end portion of the bottle fitment (see FIGS. 9 and 10), which retains the fitment.

Baxter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,189 is directed to a container for viscous fluids having an insert provided with a pouring lip. A cover includes a flange to engage a flange on the fitment when the cover is closed. As seen in FIG. 4, inner aspects of the finish appear to extend inwardly against the fitment and cover. The finish has outwardly extending threads cooperating with inwardly extending threads of a cap.

Bavegems, U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,566 discloses a transition piece having internal threads cooperating with external threads on a container finish. The transition piece includes a spout. The patent mentions that by attaching the transition piece by a screw head, if the user prefers not to use the pouring spout, but prefers to fill it by the free neck opening, this can be done easily by unscrewing the transition piece. The preferred embodiment is said to disclose a refill facilitating pouring spout which is part of a transition piece with inside screw head for fastening to the container cap.

Li, U.S. Pat. No. 4,706,829 discloses a dispensing package including a bottle finish having outwardly extending threads mating with a cap having inwardly extending threads. A pour spout-containing fitment is mounted on the bottle finish.

Moore, U.S. Pat. No. 5,251,788 discloses a closure having interior threads designed to engage exterior threads on a spout body. The spout body includes internal threading which mates with external threading on the container finish.

Ekkert et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,435,467 is directed to a container having an externally threaded finish which mates with an internally threaded finish of a closure. A fitment having a radially extending flange is inserted within the mouth of the container and the radially extending flange rests upon the top of the finish. The arrangement is such that the amount of residual contents left within the container is said to be diminished. The illustrated spout fitment appears to have substantial areas open for product to flow through, relative to the area defined by the outer spout wall.

Haga et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,890,770 discloses a package having outer threads mating with inner threads of an adapter which has a pour spout. The adapter has outer threads which mate with inner threads on a closure. The closure includes a flange which rests on a portion of the adapter.

Haffner et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,462,202 is directed to a liquid dispensing fitment which rests on an upper edge of the container finish. The container finish includes outside extending screws which mate with inwardly extending screws on the closure. The fitment includes a pour spout.

Fuchs et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,917,269 discloses a package having a neck comprising an upwardly extending integral dispensing spout. Internal threads on the container finish cooperate with external threads on the closure. The closure also includes an annular flexible sealing ring and a second sealing ring.

Moore et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,772 discloses a dispensing package including a finish having outer threads which mate with inner threads on a spout fitment. The spout fitment also has outer threads which mate with inner threads on a closure.

Reiber et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,421 discloses a plastic blow molded container having an annular finish and an insert positioned in the finish and interengaged with the internal surface of the finish. The insert has internal threads for receiving a closure which may be in the form of a self draining measuring cup having external threads on the lower end thereof and a peripheral flange sealingly engaging the free end of the finish. In one form, the insert is placed in position while the finish is hot, and when the finish cools it shrinks into sealing engagement with the finish. In another form, the insert is spin welded into sealing engagement with the finish. Alternatively, an adhesive may be used.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,550,862 shows a liquid product pouring and measuring package having a measuring cup which also serves as the closure for the package. The package includes a container including a container body with an upwardly extending finish and a dispensing orifice. A transition collar is mounted on the container finish and has a pouring spout and a circumscribing wall with fastening means on its interior surface. A measuring cup serves as a closure for the package and includes outwardly disposed fastening means adapted to mate with the inwardly facing fastening means on the transition collar to attach the measuring cup in the inverted position to the transition collar and thereby provide a closure for the package.

Locking teeth can be provided on the inner periphery of the transition collar to mate with locking teeth on the container finish so that the transition collar, when mounted on the container finish, will not rotate. However, a more secure engagement between the transition collar and the container finish can be provided by a glued engagement. The glued engagement provides a firm and rigid interlocking between the container finish and transition collar.

However, it would be desirable to provide an improved package including the container and transition collar with firm interlocking between these components. The improved package would include a measuring cup mounted onto the transition collar, wherein for example the resultant interlock between the container and collar will allow the measuring cup to be removed and replaced without causing rotation of the collar. This should desirably be accomplished with a glued, interlocked engagement and with a reasonable cost and with a minimum amount of glue.

It is therefore a principal object of the present invention to provide an improved package for liquids including a container for housing liquids and a transition collar having a pouring spout firmly mounted on the container finish.

It is a further object of the present invention to provide an improved package as aforesaid including a measuring cup mounted on the transition collar, wherein the measuring cup can be removed and replaced without causing rotation of the collar.

Yet another object of the present invention is to provide the correct spout orientation, sealing, and locking when applied to the container.

Further objects and advantages of the present invention will appear hereinbelow.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a dispensing and closing package for a liquid comprising a container or bottle, and a cap and spout closure. Moreover, the invention consists of a cap and notched spout closure designed to mate with a lugged container or bottle neck which allows the spout to be oriented and locked to prevent removal by the customer. In one embodiment, the lugs are located on the parting lines of the bottle, thereby allowing for more plastic to be used in the lug formation, and thus, providing more durable lugs. In another embodiment, the lugs are dovetail shaped, which, when mated to corresponding dovetail shaped notches, create a very strong mechanism to prevent over-torquing during assembly or inadvertent spout removal. In yet another embodiment, the cap and spout closure contains a flexible band spout seal which has been created in such a way that it will prevent product leakage and conform to the top of the bottle, even when the bottle is not perfectly trimmed, or trimmed to differing heights.

The cap and spout of the present invention allows for receipt of empty bottles in a bulk, oriented, palletized format without the cap and spout closure pre-assembled onto the container of bottle. The bottles can be filled prior to installation of the oriented cap and spout and closure.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to a chewable confectionery composition which reduces the presence of dental plaque from the chewing surfaces of teeth and more particularly the invention relates to a chewable confectionery composition which contains a small but effective amount of a an enzyme effective to disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and adhesion to tooth surfaces.

2. Prior Art

Oral compositions such as toothpastes, gels and mouth washes are designed to loosen and remove plaque in conjunction with a regular toothbrushing regimen. Dental plaque is present to some degree, in the form of a film, on virtually all dental surfaces. It is a byproduct of microbial growth, and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque itself adheres firmly to dental surfaces and is removed only with difficulty even through a rigorous brushing regimen. Moreover, plaque rapidly reforms on the tooth surface after it is removed. Plaque may form on any part of the tooth surface, and is found particularly at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel and on the surface of dental calculus. The problem associated with the formation of plaque on the teeth lies in the tendency of plaque to build up and eventually produce gingivitis, periodontitis and other types of periodontal disease, as well as dental caries and dental calculus.

Plaque formation is an ongoing process. Although various oral care products are available to control plaque formation such as toothpastes and mouth rinse, the disadvantage of these products is that only a relatively short time during which the teeth are being brushed or the mouth is being rinsed is available for these preparations to take effect. A further disadvantage of these toothpaste and mouth rinse products is the general infrequency of use, that is, most dental hygiene products are used once or perhaps twice daily and seldom when they are most needed, e.g., after meals and snacks. Thus food deposits which build up as a result of eating throughout the day are left in the oral cavity for long periods of time thereby promoting microbial growth and formation of plaque on tooth surfaces.

It is known to the art to incorporate antimicrobial agents in oral compositions wherein these agents destroy or inhibit oral bacteria responsible for plaque formation. Other agents are also incorporated in the oral composition to reduce plaque formation on teeth. For example, it is known to incorporate enzymes such as proteases and carbohydrases in oral compositions, which enzymes disrupt or interfere with plaque formation and bacterial adhesion to tooth surfaces.

Chewable tablets and gums have been used as vehicles for introducing various chemical agents to tooth surfaces including enzymes such as amylase enzymes (U.S. Pat. No. 4,740,368) oxidoreductases such as glucose oxidase and lactoperoxidase enzymes (U.S. Pat. No. 4,564,519).

A critical requirement, however, for these compositions is that they are stable and have a long shelf-life, which requirement has limited the use of these compositions because normally, the active agents incorporated in these compositions that provide oral care benefits such as plaque reduction are not stable under ambient conditions of humidity and temperature and as a result the agents quickly become degraded to concentrations of limited efficacy and particularly, enzymes which denature during the manufacturing process.

In view of the inconvenience of using toothpaste and mouth rinse products when away from home, the art is seeking portable products in the form of chewable confections such as tablets and gums which can be used throughout the day, particularly after eating, and which provide antiplaque benefits comparable to those obtained by regular brushing with a toothpaste or use of a mouthrinse.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a chewable confectionery composition such as a chewable tablet or gum comprised of a small but effective amount of a plaque reducing enzyme, a non-cariogenic sweetener and optionally a plasticizing/softening agent.

Due to the inherent nature of the chewable tablet or gum product, prolonged contact with the tooth surfaces is achieved when the product is chewed, forming a paste with saliva containing the enzyme which coats the tooth surfaces. The delivery of the enzyme in a chewable tablet or gum form insures that an adequate dosage of the antiplaque enzyme is deliverable when the product is chewed by the user. The chewable confectionery composition of the present invention is portable and can be packaged and stored in a consumers pocket or purse for consumption anytime and anywhere.

When the chewable confectionery composition of the present invention is placed within the mouth and chewed, an effective antiplaque amount of the enzyme is released from the composition into the saliva where it can reach the surface of the teeth to prevent further plaque accumulation. The tablet or gum of the present invention is formed so as to release the enzyme over a period of 0.5 to 2 minutes. Consistent daily use of the chewable tablets or gums of the present invention will then obtain maximum plaque reduction from the teeth of the consumer.

The term “chewable confectionery composition” as used herein includes within its meaning chewing gum, and chewable and orally soluble tablets, troches and lozenges.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser or the oral care member for cleansing the tongue and other soft tissue in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, bad breath in healthy people is often attributable to microbial deposits on the tongue. Due to its papillary nature, the tongue creates a unique ecological site that provides a large surface area, which favors the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue can lead to the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers have not adequately met the need. Past scrapers have typically been uncomfortable, risked injury to the user, and/or lacked effectiveness. Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of bacteria and other debris with comfort and safety.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser provided with a combination of hard and soft materials to cleanse the tongue and other soft tissue within the mouth with comfort and a reduced risk of injury to the user.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a head and at least one projection protruding from the head to cleanse soft tissue within a mouth of a user. The projection is formed of multiple components including a first component composed of a first material having a first hardness value and a second component composed of a second material having second hardness value. The second component overlies a portion of the first component, wherein the first and second hardness values are different. A tissue cleansing projection is provided on the second component. In yet another construction, the first hardness value is greater than the second hardness value.

In one aspect of the invention, a toothbrush includes a projection having a base with a tip remote from the head to engage and clean the soft tissue, and a soft material component overlies at least the tip of the base and the second component includes a tissue cleaning projection extending from the second component.

In one embodiment, a tongue cleanser is formed of two components that combine to define at least one cleaning projection that extends from a head of an implement. One component of the tongue cleanser is composed of a relatively hard material to provide stability and effective cleaning of the soft tissue. The other component is composed of a relatively soft material to provide comfort and safety to the user during use of the implement.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an oral care system, in particular, to a container with an oral care implement holder.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

While it is important to clean one's teeth regularly throughout the day, doing so can be difficult. The difficulty may result from the fact that a person usually does not have an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, and a dentifrice, such as toothpaste, available to them throughout the course of a day. For example, at work, at a restaurant, during travel, such items might not be readily available. Further, having to carry separate items such as a toothbrush, a separate dispenser for dentifrice, etc. can be cumbersome. Additionally, carrying the toothbrush into a foreign environment has the potential to expose the toothbrush to unsanitary conditions. Generally, the toothbrush can be exposed to germs or other pathogens. Additionally, the toothbrush can be exposed to other unwanted substances. For example, during transport in a travel bag, an exposed toothbrush has the potential to come into contact with lotions, shampoo, hair, etc. The toothbrush should be kept sanitary to avoid potential health complications which may arise if an unsanitary toothbrush is used. One way of keeping the toothbrush sanitary, is to enclose the toothbrush in a separate container. However, such an additional container would further add to the number of items a user must carry.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention pertains to an oral care system with an oral care implement and a dentifrice container.

In one aspect, a oral care system that may include an oral care implement and a dentifrice container which are engagable so as to form a compact, convenient, portable oral care system which maintains the oral care instrument in a sanitary condition.

In one aspect of the invention, an oral care implement has a handle and a head with a tooth cleaning element. The oral care implement is collapsible to be configurable between a “use” and a “transport” state. Further, the oral care system has a dentifrice container with a cavity for holding dentifrice and a dispensing outlet. Further, when the oral care implement is in the “transport” state, it is engagable with the dentifrice container for securing the oral care implement to the dentifrice container.

Another aspect of this invention is directed to a dentifrice container engaged with an oral care implement to form an assembly unit. The dentifrice container has a top portion and a bottom portion which engage with opposite longitudinal ends of the oral care implement to hold the oral care implement between said top and bottom portions of the dentifrice container.

Yet another aspect of this invention is directed to a dentifrice container with a cavity for holding dentifrice, a dispensing outlet and opposing first and second sidewalls. Further, the container has a top portion which extends laterally beyond the first sidewall and a bottom portion which extends laterally beyond said first sidewall. The top portion is superimposed above the bottom portion and also the top portion, bottom portion and sidewall together form a storage channel.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers are inadequate in respect to their effectiveness on the soft tissue surface of the tongue. Broad flat scraping blades are limited in their ability to reach between the papillae where the bacteria and microdebris have collected. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face; a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections; and one or more peg members extending from a lower base surface of the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising one or more complementary apertures that receive the one or more peg members and expose tops of the one or more peg members.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face; and a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections extending beyond the second face of the head.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head having a longitudinal axis; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face, the receiving cavity comprising a peripheral sidewall extending away from a lower base surface; a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of nubs that extend beyond the second face of the head; and at least one peg member aligned along the longitudinal axis and extending from the lower base surface of the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising at least one complementary aperture that exposes a top of the at least one peg member.

In an even further aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a soft tissue cleanser on the head opposite the first face, the soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded to the head to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections; and at least one peg member aligned along the longitudinal axis and extending from the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising at least one complementary aperture that exposes a top of the at least one peg member

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems and dispensers, and more specifically, to an applicator for an oral care material dispenser.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to one's teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, with an enhanced tissue cleaner. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, they have generally not been effective or easy to use. Further, many of these scrapers cannot easily be used to cleanse other tissue within the mouth. Notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by cleaning the tissue in the mouth, many users avoid the use of such cleansers due to a lack of comfort and/or ease of use. The present description seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and to provide new features heretofore not available.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a configuration of tissue cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of the tongue and other mouth tissue.

In one aspect of the invention, an oral care implement has a head connected to a handle. The head includes a tooth cleaning element region and a tissue cleaning element region. The tooth cleaning element region may include various bristle or other tooth cleaning element arrangements. The tissue cleaning element region includes a plurality of angled tissue cleaning projections. The tissue cleaning projections can be movable between a plurality of positions to provide directional cleaning.

In another aspect of the invention, the angled tissue cleaning projections can be configured on a portion of the head and another portion of the head can include a plurality of substantially rigid projections formed of a more rigid material than the angled tissue cleaning projections.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a display carton blank, and display carton for a plurality of products where the contained products are maintained in a set array in the carton. The carton is comprised of a carton and a separator, the separator being maintained in place by recesses in the sidewalls of the carton. The carton front surface can be at least partially transparent. Other surfaces also can be at least partially transparent.

Many products are sold in amounts of two to ten or more. Many of these products are preferably displayed and maintained in a set array in the carton. Being maintained in a set array is useful in cases where the units are to be seen through an at least partially transparent front surface. The units that can be seen through the front surface can be a significant factor in the product being purchased. The products are preferably displayed neatly to convey the proper message about the product to the prospective purchaser. In addition, the carton should be of a low cost, structurally stable, tamper evident and versatile in display. As used herein, versatile in display means that the carton can be displayed both resting on a store shelf and suspended from a peg or similar hardware that extends outwardly from a vertical support. When the product can be displayed sitting on a store shelf it then also can be stored on a shelf at the purchaser's residence. Storability by the purchaser is convenient because the units in the carton may be used over a period of time. The carton should have sufficient structural stability so as not to be damaged during shipping and handling and display at the retail outlet. It also should be sufficiently durable to protect the contained units from any damage. To be tamper evident, it should be discernable from a casual inspection whether the carton has been the subject of any tampering.

The present carton solves the above problems through a unique structure for the carton. The carton has a unique carton structure, a unique product separator structure, and a unique carton/product separator interfitting structure. Low cost is achieved by the use of a design that minimizes the amount of material yet maintains sufficient strength. This results in a display carton for a plurality of products at a low cost, one which is structurally stable, is tamper evident, and is versatile in display.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a display carton for a plurality of products. In one embodiment, the carton comprises a front panel and a rear panel, the front panel and the rear panel connected one to the other by a top panel and a bottom panel, each of the front panel, the top panel and the bottom panel having appended side flaps.

Optionally, the second temperature is at least 70° C., typically 70 to 76° C., higher than the first temperature.

Typically, the first temperature is 47 to 53° C. and the second temperature is 70 to 76° C. For example, the first temperature may be from 62 to 69° C. and the second temperature may be from 79 to 86° C.

Optionally, the second component terminates solidification thereof during the cooling step prior to solidification of the first component.

Optionally, the first and second components respectively include different first and second gellant compositions to provide different respective melting temperatures of the first and second components of the personal care composition.

Typically, the feeding of the second component in step (c) is commenced after termination of the feeding of the first component in step (b).

Optionally, the container is rotated on the container support additionally during at least a part of feeding step (c). Optionally, the container is rotated on the container support after the termination of both feeding step (b) and feeding step (c).

Optionally, the container is rotated on the container support additionally during at least a part of cooling step (e).

The container is typically rotated on the container support in an oscillating manner in the first rotational direction and in an opposite second rotational direction. For example, the container is rotated at least 90 degrees in a first direction and at least 90 degrees in a second direction. Typically, the container is rotated up to about 360 degrees in a first direction and up to about 360 degrees in a second direction. The container may be rotated up to about 270 degrees in the first direction and up to about 270 degrees in the second direction.

Optionally, the container support maintains the container at an angle of up to about 20 degrees to a vertical orientation.

Optionally, the container is subject to a vibration during the feeding of at least the second component to the container.

The first and second components may be fed into the container from a nozzle having two inputs and two outputs, one input and output pair for each respective component.

In one aspect, the present processes can produce random diffuse patterns of personal care composition in containers. By random diffuse pattern is meant an irregular pattern that has a discernable artistic yet non-geometric pattern, but where the pattern varies in dimensions and the color varies in color density to provide a color gradation throughout the personal care composition. In one embodiment there may be strongly differentiated regions and/or lines of different color, for example a darker color composition dispersed randomly and diffusely in lighter color matrix. The results are unique and very artistic patterns.

The solid personal care composition in the container may have a marbleized appearance or a swirl pattern. When the container is transparent or translucent, the pattern is continuously visible. When the container is opaque, the pattern is visible when the product is used, for example when a working surface of the topical personal care composition is revealed to the user, typically when the upper surface of a stick is exposed for topical application to the skin.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement having a supplemental feature incorporated within and/or at the back of the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristled section on a front face of the oral care implement followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums.FIG. 1schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush10, which has a head12and a handle14. As shown, the head has bristles16extending from a front face of its head platform18. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

Some toothbrushes have a tongue cleaner on a second face that is opposite to the first face. This configuration permits the user to use a single device for cleaning their teeth, as well as their tongue, by rotating the toothbrush as needed to change the active face.FIG. 2schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device30, which is generally the same as toothbrush10except that it includes a tongue cleaner20on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 2, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements that can provide multiple cleaning functions in a single device. Further, there is a need for alternative oral care implements that can simultaneously perform multiple functions and comfortably fits within a user's mouth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter.

An oral care implement according to aspects of the invention can include a head platform having a plurality of faces and an insert retention space formed therebetween. The oral care implement can have an insert disposed within the insert retention space. The oral care implement can further include a transparent or translucent support member on one of the faces and a reflective insert within the insert retention space.

An oral care implement according to aspects of the invention can include a plurality of support members on a plurality of faces from which cleaning elements extend. The oral care implement can further include a fluid-permeable and/or air-permeable support member on one of the faces and an insert proximate the support member containing a fluid-permeable and/or air-permeable agent.

These and other aspects of the disclosure will be apparent upon consideration of the following detailed description of illustrative embodiments.

"This invention relates to oral compositions containing an anticalculus agent.

Calculus is a hard, mineralized formation which forms on the teeth. Regular brushing aids in preventing a rapid build-up of these deposits, but even regular brushing is not sufficient to remove all of the calculus deposits which adhere to the teeth. Calculus is formed on the teeth when crystals of calcium phosphates begin to be deposited in the pellicle and extracellular matrix of the dental plaque and become sufficiently closely packed together for the aggregates to become resistant to deformation. There is no complete agreement on the route by which calcium and orthophosphate ultimately become the crystalline material called hydroxyapatite (HAP). It is generally agreed, however, that at higher saturations, that is, above the critical saturation limit, the precursor to crystalline HAP is an amorphous or microcrystalline calcium phosphate. “Amorphous calcium phosphate” although related to hydroxyapatite differs from it in atomic structure, particle morphology, and stoichiometry. The X-ray diffraction pattern of amorphous calcium phosphate shows broad peaks typical of amorphous materials, which lack the long-range atomic order characteristic of all crystalline materials, including HAP. It is apparent therefore that agents which effectively interfere with crystalline growth of HAP will be effective as anticalculus agents. A suggested mechanism by which the anticalculus agents of this invention inhibit calculus formation probably involves an increase of the activation energy barrier thus inhibiting the transformation of precursor amorphous calcium phosphate to HAP.

Studies have shown that there is a good correlation between the ability of a compound to prevent HAP crystalline growth in vitro and its ability to prevent calcification in vivo, provided of course that such compound is stable in plaque, saliva and their components.

The prior art indicates that soluble pyrophosphate may be utilized to reduce calculus formation. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,515,772 issued May 7, 1985 to Parran et al refers to several prior art references disclosing oral compositions containing soluble pyrophosphate salts, including an article by Draus et al, Arch. Oral. Biol., 15, pp 893-896, (1970), which discloses the in vitro effectiveness of such salts against calculus. The article refers to possible inhibition of pyrophosphate by pyrophosphatase enzyme.

It is known that saliva contains acid phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase and pyrophosphatase enzymes. It is considered that any one of the three enzymes may adversely affect pyrophosphates as an inhibitor of HAP formation and calculus. It is accordingly apparent that an anticalculus pyrophosphate dentifrice composition, should inhibit, reduce or nullify the destructive activity of all three salivary enzymes.

The compositions of the aforementioned Parran et al patent are limited to a pH of 6.0 to 10.0 and comprise a fluoride and soluble dialkali metal pyrophosphates alone or admixed with tetraalkali metal pyrophosphates, but no more than 4.0% K4P2O7(tetrapotassium pyrophosphate).

Said patent application Ser. No. 06/775,851 is concerned with oral compositions containing as anticalculus agent one or a mixture of linear molecularly dehydrated polyphosphate salts, including dialkali metal and tetraalkali metal pyrophosphates and as combination inhibitor against enzymatic hydrolysis of said agent in saliva, a fluoride ion source and a synthetic anionic linear polymeric polycarboxylate. As stated therein, compounds providing a source of fluoride ion have been profusely disclosed in the prior art as anti-caries agent but not for inhibiting salivary hydrolysis of linear polyphosphate salts employed as anticalculus agents. For example, in an article by G. W. Rapp et al in J. Dent. Res. 29. 372-376 (1960) entitled “Pyrophosphate: A Factor in Tooth Erosion”, the erosive effects of relatively large amounts of pyrophosphate accumulating in saliva and salivary debris in contact with tooth substance in producing eroded lesions on enamel, exposed dentin and cementum was studied. In these studies, fluoride from NaF was employed to inhibit hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by pyrophosphatase enzyme and thus permit accumulation of the pyrophosphate to determine its tooth erosion effects.

It is an object of this invention to provide an improved dentifrice composition containing one or a mixture of pyrophosphate salts as essential anticalculus (antitartar) agent.

Another object of this invention is to provide such a composition containing one or more inhibitors against enzymatic hydrolysis of said agent in saliva.

Still another object of this invention is to provide such a composition effective over a relatively wide pH range and/or with improved cosmetic properties.

A further object of this invention is to provide such a composition which does not significantly erode tooth surfaces and which also exerts substantial and acceptable anti-caries effects.

Yet a further object of this invention is the provision of an improved method for inhibiting the formation of calculus. Other objects and advantages will appear as the description proceeds.

Earlier in the development of this invention, it was found that dentifrice compositions containing only tetrasodium pyrophosphate as anticalculus agent were gritty, and that the solid gritty particles were composed of undissolved Na4P2O7.

The present invention is at least in part based on our determinations or discoveries that fluoride ion inhibits hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by acid phosphatase and pyrophosphatase enzymes, that the synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylate salts referred to in said parent application Ser. No. 06/775,851 inhibit hydrolysis of pyrophosphate by alkaline phosphatase, and that the occurrence of gritty particles in the oral compositions can be avoided by employing a predominant portion of the pyrophosphate in the form of the tetrapotassium salt.

In accordance with certain of its aspects, this invention relates to a dentifrice composition in the form of a toothpaste, dental gel, toothpowder, dental tablet or lozenge containing an orally acceptable vehicle and, in approximate weight proportions,A. 4.3% to 7% of alkali metal pyrophosphates as essential anticalculus agent, comprising at least 4.3% of tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, alone or admixed with up to 2.7% of tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and as inhibitors against enzymatic hydrolysis of said agent in saliva,B. an amount of a fluoride ion source sufficient to supply 25 ppm. to 5,000 ppm. of fluoride ions, andC. 0% to 3% of a synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylate having a molecular weight of about 1,000 to about 1,000,000.

Synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylates and their complexes with various cationic germicides, zinc and magnesium have been previously disclosed as anticalculus agents per se in, for example U.S. Pat. No. 3,429,963 to Shedlovsky and instant assignee, U.S. Pat. No. 4,152,420 to Gaffar and instant assignee, U.S. Pat. No. 3,956,480 to Dichter et al and instant assignee, U.S. Pat. No. 4,138,477 to Gaffar and instant assignee, and U.S. Pat. No. 4,183,914 to Gaffar et al. None of these patents however nor any other known prior art, discloses use of such polycarboxylates alone for inhibiting salivary hydrolysis of pyrophosphate anticalculus agents, much less in combination with a compound providing a source of fluoride ion. It is to be understood that the synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylates per se disclosed in these patents are operative in the compositions and methods of this invention and such disclosures are to that extent incorporated herein by reference thereto.

The synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylates optionally but preferably employed herein are, as indicated above, well known, being employed in the form of their free acids or partially or preferably fully neutralized water soluble alkali metal (e.g. potassium and preferably sodium) or ammonium salts. Preferred are 1:4 to 4:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride or acid with another polymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, preferably methyl vinyl ether (methoxyethylene) having a molecular weight (M.W.) of about 30,000 to about 1,000,000. These copolymers are available for example as Gantrez (AN 139 (M.W. 500,000), A.N. 119 (M.W. 250,000) and preferably S-97 Pharmaceutical Grade (M.W. 70,000), of GAF Corporation. The term “synthetic” is intended to exclude known thickening or gelling agents comprising carboxymethyl-cellulose and other derivatives of cellulose and natural gums. Also excluded are the zinc, magnesium and similar metal complexes of these polymeric polycarboxylates.

Other operative polymeric polycarboxylates include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,956,480 referred to above, such as the 1:1 copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethyl acrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, N-vinyl-2-pyrollidone, or ethylene, the latter being available for example as Monsanto EMA No. 1103, M.W. 10,000, and EMA Grade 61, and 1:1 copolymers of acrylic acid with methyl or hydroxyethyl methacrylate, methyl or ethyl acrylate, isobutyl vinyl ether or N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone.

Additional operative polymeric polycarboxylates disclosed in above referred to U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,138,477 and 4,183,914, include copolymers of maleic anhydride with styrene, isobutylene or ethyl vinyl ether, polyacrylic, polyitaconic and polymaleic acids, and sulfoacrylic oligomers of M.W. as low as 1,000, available as Uniroyal ND-2.

Suitable generally are polymerized olefinically or ethylenically unsaturated carboxylic acids containing an activated carbon-to-carbon olefinic double bond and at least one carboxyl group, that is, an acid containing an olefinic double bond which readily functions in polymerization because of its presence in the monomer molecule either in the alpha-beta position with respect to a carboxyl group or as part of a terminal methylene grouping: Illustrative of such acids are acrylic, methacrylic, ethacrylic, alpha-chloroacrylic, crotonic, beta-acryloxy propionic, sorbic, alpha-chlorsorbic, cinnamic, beta-styrylacrylic, muconic, itaconic, citraconic, mesaconic, glutaconic, aconitic, alpha-phenylacrylic, 2-benzyl acrylic, 2-cyclohexylacrylic, angelic, umbellic, fumaric, maleic acids and anhydrides. Other different olefinic monomers copolymerizable with such carboxylic monomers include vinylacetate, vinyl chloride, dimethyl maleate and the like. Copolymers contain sufficient carboxylic salt groups for water-solubility.

Also useful herein are carboxyvinyl polymers, disclosed as toothpaste components in U.S. Pat. No. 3,980,767 issued Sep. 14, 1976 to Choun et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,935,306 issued Jan. 27, 1976 to Roberts et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,919,409 issued Nov. 11, 1975 to Perla et al, U.S. Pat. No. 3,911,904 issued Oct. 7, 1975 to Harrison and U.S. Pat. No. 3,711,604 issued Jan. 16, 1973 to Colodney et al. They are commercially available for example under the trademarks Carbopol 934, 940 and 941 of B.F. Goodrich, these products consisting essentially of a colloidally water-soluble polymer of poly-acrylic acid crosslinked with from about 0.75% to about 2.0% of polyallyl sucrose or polyallyl pentaerythritol as cross-linking agent.

The synthetic anionic polymeric polycarboxylate component is mainly a hydrocarbon with optional halogen and O-containing substituents and linkages as present example ester, ether and OH groups, and when present is generally employed in the instant compositions in approximate weight amounts of 0.05 to 3%, preferably 0.05 to 2%, more preferably 0.1 to 2%. Amounts in the upper portions of these ranges are typically employed in dentifrice compositions typically containing a dental abrasive and used in conjunction with brushing of the teeth, e.g. tooth pastes (including creams), gels, powders and tablets. Amounts in excess of these ranges may be employed for thickening or gelling purposes.

As indicated above, these polymeric polycarboxylates have been found to be effective inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase enzyme. Since this enzyme has little activity (for hydrolyzing pyrophosphate) at about pH 7.0 or below, the polymeric polycarboxylate component may, if desired, be omitted from oral preparations formulated to operate at such pH of 7.0 or below. Such omission however obviously reduces the versatility and effectiveness of the present oral compositions over the broad pH range of about 4.5 to about 10.

The sources of fluoride ions, or fluoride-providing compounds, required according to this invention as an essential acid phosphatase and pyrophosphatase enzyme inhibitor component are well known in the art as anti-caries agents and also act as such agents in the practice of this invention. These compounds may be slightly soluble in water or may be fully water-soluble. They are characterized by their ability to release fluoride ions in water and by freedom from undesired reaction with other compounds of the oral preparation. Among these materials are inorganic fluoride salts, such as soluble alkali metal, alkaline earth metal salts, for example, sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, ammonium fluoride, calcium fluoride, a copper fluoride such as cuprous fluoride, zinc fluoride, barium fluoride, sodium fluorosilicate, ammonium fluorosilicate, sodium fluorozirconate, sodium monofluorophosphate, aluminum mono- and di-fluorophosphate, and fluorinated sodium calcium pyrophosphate. Alkali metal and tin fluorides, such as sodium and stannous fluorides, sodium monofluorophosphate (MFP) and mixtures thereof, are preferred.

The amount of fluoride-providing compound is dependent to some extent upon the type of compound, its solubility, and the type of oral preparation, but it must be a nontoxic amount, generally about 0.005 to about 3.0% in the preparation. In a dentifrice preparation, e.g. dental gel, toothpaste (including cream), toothpowder, or dental tablet, an amount of such compound which releases up to about 5,000 ppm of F ion by weight of the preparation is considered satisfactory. Any suitable minimum amount of such compound may be used, but it is preferable to employ sufficient compound to release about 300 to 2,000 ppm, more preferably about 800 to about 1,500 ppm of fluoride ion. Typically, in the cases of alkali metal fluorides and stannous fluoride, this component is present in an amount up to about 2% by weight, based on the weight of the preparation, and preferably in the range of about 0.05% to 1%. In the case of sodium monofluorophosphate, the compound may be present in an amount of about 0.1-3%, more typically about 0.76%.

In dentifrice preparations such as lozenges and chewing gum, the fluoride-providing compound is typically present in an amount sufficient to release up to about 500 ppm, preferably about 25 to 300 ppm by weight of fluoride ion. Generally about 0.005 to about 1.0 wt. % of such compound is present.

The dentifrice compositions of this invention achieve the desired anticalculus effect by mixing therein about 4.3% to about 7% of tetrapotassium pyrophosphate alone or with up to 2.7% of tetrasodium pyrophosphate. Preferred ratios of the tetrapotassium:tetrasodium salts range from about 4.3:2.7 to about 6:1, especially a ratio of 4.5:1.5. Contrary to the disclosure in the aforementioned Parran et al patent, it is highly significant that the compositions of this invention have highly acceptable anticalculus and improved cosmetic properties while including more than 4.0% of the tetrapotassium pyrophosphate and without inclusion of any dialkali metal pyrophosphate, although small amounts thereof, such as about 0.1% to about 0.4% or about 1.0% may be so intruded if desired.

The pH of the dentifrice preparations of this invention is generally in the range of from about 4.5 to about 10 and typically from about 5.5 to 9. The pH is preferably in the range of from about 6 to about 8.0. It is noteworthy that the compositions of the invention may be applied orally at said pH ranges without substantially decalcifying or otherwise damaging dental enamel. The pH can be controlled with acid (e.g. citric acid or benzoic acid) or base (e.g. sodium hydroxide) or buffered (as with sodium citrate, benzoate, carbonate, or bicarbonate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium dihydrogen phosphate, etc.).

In certain desirable forms of this invention, the dentifrice composition may be substantially solid or pasty in character, such as toothpowder, a dental tablet, a toothpaste (cream), or a dental gel. The vehicle of such solid or pasty dentifrice preparations typically contains an orally or dentally acceptable polishing material for use in conjunction with a brushing of the teeth. Examples of such polishing materials are water-insoluble sodium metaphosphate, potassium metaphosphate, tricalcium phosphate, dihydrated calcium phosphate, anhydrous dicalcium phosphate, calcium pyrophosphate, magnesium orthophosphate, trimagnesium phosphate, calcium carbonate, aluminum silicate, zirconium silicate, silica, bentonite, and mixtures thereof. Other suitable polishing materials include the particulate thermosetting resins described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,070,510 of Dec. 15, 1962 such as melamine-, phenolic-, and urea-formaldehydes, and cross-linked polyepoxides and polyesters. Preferred polishing materials include crystalline silica having particle sizes of up to about 5 microns, a mean particle size of up to about 1.1 microns, and a surface area of up to about 50,000 cm.2/gm., silica gel or colloidal silica, and complex amorphous alkali metal alumino-silicate.

When visually clear gels are desired, a polishing agent of colloidal silica, such as those sold under the trademark SYLOID as Syloid 72 and Syloid 74 or under the trademark SANTOCEL as Santocel 100 and alkali metal alumino-silicate complexes are particularly useful, since they have refractive indices close to the refractive indices of gelling agent-liquid (including water and/or humectant) systems commonly used in dentifrices.

Many of the so-called “water-insoluble” polishing materials are anionic in character and also include small amounts of soluble material. Thus, insoluble sodium meta-phosphate may be formed in any suitable manner as illustrated by Thorpe'sDictionary of Applied Chemistry, Volume 9, 4th Edition, pp. 510-511. The forms of insoluble sodium meta-phosphate known as Madrell's salt and Kurrol's salt are further examples of suitable materials. These metaphosphate salts exhibit only a minute solubility in water, and therefore are commonly referred to as insoluble metaphosphates (IMP). There is present therein a minor amount of soluble phosphate material as impurities, usually a few percent such as up to 4% by weight. The amount of soluble phosphate material, which is believed to include a soluble sodium trimetaphosphate in the case of insoluble metaphosphate, may be reduced or eliminated by washing with water if desired. The insoluble alkali metal metaphosphate is typically employed in powder form of a particle size such that no more than about 1% of the material is larger than about 37 microns.

The polishing material is generally present in the solid or pasty compositions in weight concentrations of about 10% to about 99%. Preferably, it is present in amounts ranging 10 from about 10% to about 75% in toothpaste or gel and from about 70% to about 99% in toothpowder or tablet.

In a toothpaste, the liquid vehicle may comprise water and humectant typically in an amount ranging from about 10% to about 90% by weight of the preparation. Glycerine, propylene glycol, sorbitol, polypropylene glycol and/or poly-ethylene glycol (e.g. 400-600) exemplify suitable humectants/carriers. Also advantageous are liquid mixtures of water, glycerine and sorbitol. In clear gels where the refractive index is an important consideration, about 3-30 wt. % of water, 0 to about 80 wt. % of glycerine, and about 20-80 wt. % of sorbitol is preferably employed.

Toothpastes (creams) and gels typically contain a natural or synthetic thickener or gelling agent in proportions of about 0.1 to about 10, preferably about 0.5 to about 5, wt. %. A suitable thickener is synthetic hectorite, a synthetic colloidal magnesium alkali metal silicate complex clay available for example as Laponite (e.g. CP, SP 2002, D) marketed by Laporte Industries Limited. Laponite D analysis shows, approximately by weight, 58.00% SiO2, 25.40% MgO, 3.05% Na2O, 0.98% Li2O, and some water and trace metals. Its true specific gravity is 2.53 and it has an apparent bulk density (g./ml. at 8% moisture) of 1.0.

Other suitable thickeners include Irish moss, gum tragacanth, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxyethylpropyl-cellulose, hydroxybutyl methyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose (e.g. available as Natrosol), sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, and colloidal silica such as finely ground Syloid (e.g. 244).

It will be understood that, as is conventional, the oral preparations are to be sold or otherwise distributed in suitable labelled packages. Thus, a toothpaste, cream or gel will usually be in a collapsible tube, typically aluminum, lined lead or plastic, or other squeeze, pump or pressurized dispenser for metering out the contents, having a label describing it, in substance, as a toothpaste, gel or dental cream.

Organic surface-active agents are used in the compositions of the present invention to achieve increased prophylactic action, assist in achieving thorough and complete dispersion of the anticalculus agent throughout the oral cavity, and render the instant compositions more cosmetically acceptable. The organic surface-active material is preferably anionic, nonionic or ampholytic in nature, and it is preferred to employ as the surface-active agent a detersive material which imparts to the composition detersive and foaming properties. Suitable examples of anionic surfactants are water-soluble salts of higher fatty acid monoglyceride monosulfates, such as the sodium salt of the monosulfated monoglyceride of hydrogenated coconut oil fatty acids, higher alkyl sulfates such as sodium lauryl sulfate, alkyl aryl sulfonates such as sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, higher alkyl sulfoacetates, higher fatty acid esters of 1,2 dihydroxy propane sulfonate, and the substantially saturated higher aliphatic acyl amides of lower aliphatic amino carboxylic acid compounds, such as those having 12 to 16 carbons in the fatty acid, alkyl or acyl radicals, and the like. Examples of the last mentioned amides are N-lauroyl sarcosine, and the sodium, potassium, and ethanolamine salts of N-lauroyl, N-myristoyl, or N-palmitoyl sarcosine which should be substantially free from soap or similar higher fatty acid material. The use of these sarcosinate compounds in the oral compositions of the present invention is particularly advantageous since these materials exhibit a prolonged and marked effect in the inhibition of acid formation in the oral cavity due to carbohydrate breakdown in addition to exerting some reduction in the solubility of tooth enamel in acid solutions.

Examples of water-soluble nonionic surfactants are condensation products of ethylene oxide with various reactive hydrogen-containing compounds reactive therewith having long hydrophobic chains (e.g. aliphatic chains of about 12 to 20 carbon atoms), which condensation products (“ethoxamers”) contain hydrophilic polyoxyethylene moieties, such as condensation products of poly (ethylene oxide) with fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty amides, polyhydric alcohols (e.g. sorbitan monostearate) and polypropyleneoxide (e.g. Pluronic materials).

Various other materials may be incorporated in the oral preparations of this invention such as whitening agents, preservatives, silicones, chlorophyll compounds, other anti-calculus agents, and/or ammoniated material such as urea, diammonium phosphate, and mixtures thereof. These adjuvants, where present, are incorporated in the preparations in amounts which do not substantially adversely affect the properties and characteristics desired. Significant amounts of zinc, magnesium and other metal salts and materials, generally soluble, which would complex with the active components of the instant invention are to be avoided.

Any suitable flavoring or sweetening material may also be employed. Examples of suitable flavoring constituents are flavoring oils, e.g. oil of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, sassafras, clove, sage, eucalyptus, marjoram, cinnamon, lemon, and orange, and methyl salicylate. Suitable sweetening agents include sucrose, lactose, maltose, dextrose, levulose, sorbitol, xylitol, d-tryptophan, dihydrochalcones, sodium cyclamate, perillartine, APM (aspartyl phenyl alanine, methyl ester), saccharine and the like. Suitably, flavor and sweetening agents may together comprise from about 0.1% to 5% or more of the preparation.

In the preferred practice of this invention an oral composition according to this invention such as dentifrice containing the described pyrophosphate and enzyme inhibitor in an amount effective to inhibit calculus on dental surfaces is preferably applied as by brushing regularly to dental enamel, such as every second or third day or preferably from to 3 times daily, at a pH of about 4.5 to about 10, generally about 5.5 to about 9, preferably about 6 to 8, for at least 2 weeks up to 8 weeks or more up to lifetime. The dentifrice is typically removed by rinsing with water after each application.

The compositions of this invention can be incorporated in lozenges, or in chewing gum or other products, e.g. by stirring into a warm gum base or coating the outer surface of a gum base, illustrative of which may be mentioned jelutone, rubber latex, vinylite resins, etc., desirably with conventional plasticizers or softeners, sugar or other sweeteners or carbohydrates such as glucose, sorbitol and the like.

The vehicle or carrier in a tablet or lozenge is a non-cariogenic solid water soluble polyhydric alcohol (polyol) such as mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, maltitol, a hydrogenated starch hydrolysate, Lycasin, hydrogenated glucose, hydrogenated disaccharides, and hydrogenated polysaccharides, in an amount of about 90-98% by weight of the total composition. Solid salts such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, potassium bicarbonate or potassium chloride may totally or partially replace the polyol carrier.

Tableting lubricants, in minor amounts of about 0.1 to 5% by weight, may be incorporated into the tablet or lozenge formulation to facilitate the preparation of both the tablets and lozenges. Suitable lubricants include vegetable oils such as coconut oil, magnesium stearate, aluminum stearate, talc, starch and carbowax.

Lozenge formulations contain about 2% gum as barrier agent to provide a shiny surface as opposed to a tablet which has a smooth finish. Suitable non-cariogenic gums include Kappa carrageenan, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, Gantrez, and the like.

The lozenge or tablet may optionally be coated with a coating material such as waxes, shellac, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyethylene/maleic anhydride copolymer or Kappa-carrageenan to further increase the time it takes the tablet or lozenge to dissolve in the mouth. The uncoated tablet or lozenge is slow dissolving, providing a sustained release rate of active ingredients of about 3 to 5 minutes. Accordingly, the solid dose tablet and lozenge composition of this invention affords a relatively longer time period of contact of the teeth in the oral cavity with the active ingredients.

The following examples are further illustrative of the nature of the present invention, but it is understood that the invention is not limited thereto. All amounts and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight and temperatures are in degrees C. unless otherwise indicated.

"FIELD

The present invention relates generally to containers, and specifically to a closure suitable for liquid-filled containers.

BACKGROUND

A challenge in modern product packaging has been to provide container caps or closures that are aesthetically interesting to the consumer, provide brand differentiation, are light-weight in construction, economical to produce, and effectively seal the liquid contents of the container. In order to prevent leakage, conventional closures have been generally designed with flat, uniform top surface configurations so that the underside of the closure has a correspondingly flat annular surface for mating with the flat annular neck rim at the mouth of the container. This situation has heretofore limited the freedom of packaging designers in developing interesting cap configurations while still providing a satisfactory liquid seal.

An improved closure is desired that allows different and irregular configurations to be utilized without sacrificing the integrity of the liquid seal.

SUMMARY

A closure is provided that minimizes or eliminates leakage between the closure and a container holding a liquid. The closure provides a liquid sealing system that allows irregularly shaped closure tops to be used without sacrificing the effectiveness of the liquid seal.

In one aspect, the invention can be a container comprising: a container neck forming an opening about an axis, the container neck comprising a rim surface that defines a seating plane; a closure body comprising: a top wall extending radially from the axis; a plug extending axially from the top wall, the plug circumferentially surrounding the axis; a sidewall extending axially from the top wall and circumferentially surrounding the plug so as to form an annular space between the sidewall and the plug; a bottom surface of the top wall defining a roof of the annular space, the bottom surface of the top wall being non-coplanar with a reference plane that is substantially parallel to the seating plane; and a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart struts in the annular gap, each of the struts having a bottom surface that collectively define the reference plane; and the closure body secured to the container neck, the container neck extending into the annular gap so that the rim surface of the container neck contacts the bottoms surfaces of the struts, the plug extending into the opening of the container neck and forming a seal with the container neck.

In another embodiment, the invention can be a closure for sealing a liquid container comprising: an axis; a top wall extending radially from the axis; a plug extending axially from the top wall, the plug circumferentially surrounding the axis; a sidewall extending axially from the top wall and circumferentially surrounding the plug so as to form an annular space between the sidewall and the plug; a bottom surface of the top wall defining a roof of the annular space, the bottom surface of the top wall being non-coplanar with a reference plane that is substantially perpendicular to the axis; and a plurality of circumferentially spaced-apart struts in the annular gap, each of the struts having a bottom surface that collectively define a seating plane that is substantially perpendicular to the axis.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be a closure for sealing a liquid container comprising: a axis; a top wall extending radially from the axis; a plug extending axially from the top wall, the plug circumferentially surrounding the axis; a sidewall extending axially from the top wall and circumferentially surrounding the plug so as to form an annular space between the sidewall and the plug; a bottom surface of the top wall defining a roof of the annular space, the bottom surface of the top wall having an undulating contour extending circumferentially, the bottom surface having a plurality of low points and a plurality of high points resulting from the undulating contour; and at each low point, a lug formed into the bottom surface of the top wall and comprising a bottom surface, the bottom surfaces of the lugs collectively defining a seating plane that is substantially perpendicular to the axis.

In a still further aspect, the invention can be a closure having a saddle-shaped top wall having a top surface with undulating concave and convex surfaces.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be a closure for a container comprising a body having a top wall and a sidewall extending axially therefrom. The closure may define an interior cavity configured for receiving the neck portion of a container. The closure may further include a sealing tube configured to engage the neck portion of the container for forming a liquid seal. A plurality of radially-extending struts may be provided that span between the sidewall and sealing tube and which are configured to engage the neck portion of the container.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a manually manipulated toothbrush having a head with flexible sections that provide enhanced cleaning and comfort when used.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Conventional toothbrushes usually include a substantially rigid head with an outer surface from which cleaning elements extend. Conventional cleaning elements include bristles arranged in bristle tufts, elastomeric members or other known cleaning elements. However, rigid portions of certain conventional toothbrush heads can prevent the cleaning elements from being comfortably received in the mouth, and thereby prevent effective cleaning of the oral cavity.

To eliminate the problems associated with large, rigid toothbrush heads, certain conventional toothbrush heads include flexible segments that allow carried cleaning elements to move relative to the head. However, these flexible segments may not fit comfortably within the mouth of the user. Similarly, because of the size and/or shape of the flexible segments, the heads may not be comfortably manipulated within the mouth of the user during cleaning. As a result, the toothbrush may not be used on a regular basis. Additionally, when introduced into the mouth, the toothbrush may not be used for a period of time sufficient to provide the person with effective oral cleaning. It is also possible that the cleaning elements may not be capable of reaching all intended portions of the mouth. This can result in poor oral hygiene that can cause tooth and/or gum disease.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with flexible cleaning element support members that provide the user with enhanced cleaning and comfort during brushing. The cleaning element support members permit a head of the toothbrush to be comfortably received and manipulated within the user's mouth.

In one aspect of the invention, the toothbrush includes a head with a first flexible cleaning element support member positioned at a first end of the head, a second flexible cleaning element support member positioned at a second, free end of the head and at least one intermediate flexible cleaning element support member. Each flexible cleaning element support member has a flexible stem formed of a soft, resilient material that is comfortable to the user when the material contacts a portion of the user's mouth. Additionally, the flexible cleaning element support members carry cleaning elements. The flexibility of these support members allows the cleaning elements to move easily in different directions during brushing, thereby providing enhanced cleaning.

In another aspect of the invention, the toothbrush has at least two flexible cleaning element support members that each forms a continuous outer surface with a respective end of the head so that the head can be comfortably received and manipulated in a mouth.

"BACKGROUND

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending materials such as beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The methods of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants to structure the liquid, or by the addition of suspending agents such as polysaccharides, natural gums, or cellulose, that enable the liquid to suspend materials therein for long periods of time. These suspended materials can be functional, non-functional (aesthetic), or both. By aesthetic it is meant that the suspended materials impart a certain visual appearance that is pleasing or eye catching. By functional it is meant that the suspended materials contribute to the action of the composition in cleaning, fragrance release, shine enhancement, or other intended action of the composition.

It has been discovered that surfactant systems structured with polysaccharides, natural gums, or celluloses do not stably suspend materials for an extended period of time, especially materials that are not density matched to the composition. It would be desirable to suspend materials over time.

BRIEF SUMMARY

A process comprisinga) mixing at least one surfactant, water, and at least one suspending agent chosen from polysaccharides, gums, and celluloses to form a liquid composition; andb) degassing the composition.

"The present invention relates to oral care compositions and methods. In particular, the present invention includes compositions and methods for whitening of teeth.

Many individuals desire a “bright” smile and white teeth, and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material. Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque. The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.

A tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and an outer hard enamel layer that is the protective layer of the tooth. The enamel layer of a tooth is naturally opaque, and white or a slightly off-white color. The enamel layer is composed of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface. These hydroxyapatite crystals form microscopic hexagonal rods or prisms that make up the enamel surface. As a result, the surface of the enamel presents microscopic spaces or pores between the prisms. Without limiting the mechanism, function or utility of present invention, it is believed that this porous nature of the enamel is where discoloring substances permeate the enamel and discolor the teeth.

There are a variety of compositions described in the art for preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The most commonly accepted chemicals used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Peroxides are generally deemed safe from a physiological standpoint, and can be effective to whiten teeth. Such peroxides include hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, and sodium percarbonate. When these peroxides are in appropriate contact with teeth they will usually oxidize stains, rendering the teeth whiter.

Professional dental treatments frequently include a tooth surface preparation such as acid etching followed by the application of highly concentrated bleaching solutions (e.g. up to 37% hydrogen peroxide) and/or the application of heat or light. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,425,953 and 5,766,574.) These procedures provide rapid results, but are expensive, and often require several trips to the dentist. In many cases, the patient's lips are uncomfortably retracted during the entire treatment and the patient is confined to sitting in the dental chair.

Alternatively, at home bleaching systems can be used. These systems have gained significant popularity in the past decade because of reduced cost, and increased convenience. Instead of time consuming and frequent trips to the dentist, the tooth whitener is purchased at a consumer retail store and may be used while performing other personal tasks or errands, relaxing or sleeping.

Current home treatment methods include abrasive toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips. The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, the type of bleaching agent, contact time of the bleaching agent on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching active in the composition the ability of the bleaching agent to penetrate the tooth enamel, and consumer compliance. Effectiveness is also dependant on the amount of bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the active to be released during use, and the stability of the active in the product. However, the effectiveness of many of these treatments is adversely affected because of deficiencies in one or more factors relating to the composition and consumer compliance.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides oral care compositions. Embodiments include oral care compositions comprising:(a) a peroxide complex comprising a peroxide component and an N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer:(b) a whitening agent; and(c) an orally acceptable carrier.
In various embodiments, the N-vinyl heterocyclic polymer comprises a polymer selected from the group consisting of poly-N-vinyl polylactams, poly-N-vinyl-polyimides and mixtures thereof. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a film forming material. In one embodiment, the carrier comprises a silicone adhesive. In one embodiment, the whitening agent is a peroxide compound.

"BACKGROUND

A pleasant fragrance is one of important attributes that consumers expect from household cleaning compositions. For example, in dish washing liquids or hard surface cleaners, it is highly desirable to have a cleaning composition that combines high cleaning efficacy and pleasant fragrance as an additional benefit or indicator for cleanliness. Typically, a cleaning composition contains a surfactant system and a fragrance that is dissolved or dispersed in the composition. Such a composition needs to contain a relatively large amount of fragrance since the fragrance tends to be diluted and washed away as the composition is utilized.

It is highly desirable to have a cleaning composition that can release or activate fragrance while the composition is being utilized for its intended purpose such that a reduced amount of fragrance can be included in the composition without sacrificing the level of fragrance experience for the user. It is also desirable to have a cleaning composition that both provides aesthetically pleasing features and improved fragrance properties. There have been attempts to include fragrance particles in a cleaning composition to more efficiently deliver fragrances. However, such attempts do not address the aesthetic features of cleaning compositions.

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The means for providing the structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants that thicken the liquid, using salt, or by adding thickening agents such as polymers and gums to thicken the liquid so as to be able to suspend beads. The beads can be designed to provide aesthetic appeals to enhance consumer acceptance and usage. For example, the beads can include pigments or colorants to provide aesthetic features in the cleaning composition. However, the general spherical configuration of a bead may not always be an optimal configuration to provide the aesthetic and other beneficial properties.

An alternative configuration for a bead is a film fragment. For example, a toothpaste product with film fragments, which product has a water-activity of about 0.8, is commercially available and the film fragments are stable in the product. However, a film fragment, which has a larger surface area than a bead, tends to pose dimensional and compositional stability challenges. A film fragment is more prone to dissolve or deform in a structured liquid. The stability issues are more pronounced when the structured liquid has high water and surfactant contents. However, a film fragment cannot be merely designed to make it completely insoluble or stable since the fragment may interfere with the performance and properties of the cleaning composition.

SUMMARY

A cleaning composition that has improved fragrance delivery and aesthetic properties. The cleaning composition contains film flakes or fragments in a surfactant system. The cleaning composition contains at least one surfactant, and a plurality of film flakes. The composition has a water activity higher than 0.9 and a surfactant content of at least 15%, based on the total weight of the composition, wherein the film flake contains a polymer system and a composition beneficial ingredient, wherein the film flake has a solubility in water of 40% to 60%. The cleaning composition is capable of suspending the plurality of film flakes. The film flake may include a water-soluble polymer, a water-insoluble polymer and a beneficial ingredient, such as fragrance.

In another embodiment, a composition comprising at least one surfactant, a plurality of film flakes, and water, wherein the composition is capable of suspending the plurality of film flakes, wherein the film flake comprises a polymer system and a beneficial ingredient, wherein the polymer system comprises hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and polyvinyl acetate, and wherein the film flake has a solubility in water of 40% to 60%.

In another embodiment, a composition comprising at least one surfactant, a plurality of film flakes, and water, wherein the composition is capable of suspending the plurality of film flakes, wherein the composition is capable of suspending the plurality of film flakes, wherein the film flake comprises a polymer system and a beneficial ingredient, wherein the polymer system comprises polyvinyl acetate, and wherein the film flake has a solubility in water of 40% to 60%.

The invention also provides a method for delivering delayed fragrance release from a composition. The method includes contacting the composition with water to dilute the composition.

The cleaning composition provides delayed release of beneficial agents that are included in the film flake. For example, when a fragrance compound is used as a beneficial agent, the fragrance is released when the composition applied and used, creating a bloom effect of fragrance at the time of use.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with an air flossing system. Individuals exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth or perform interdental cleaning of their teeth. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with an air flossing system.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having cleaning elements for engaging oral tissue. A body is provided for gripping the implement. An air source is disposed in the body for proving pressurized air to an air outlet. The air outlet is disposed in the oral care region for injecting the pressurized air to clean debris from the oral tissue.

In another aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having at least one cleaning element for engaging oral tissue. An air device is pros idled which delivers pressurized air. An air outlet is disposed in the oral care region and is operatively connected to air device. Further, the oral care implement includes a motion-producing device capable of moving the cleaning element during release of pressurized air from the air outlet.

In another aspect, a docking station for recharging the oral care implement has an air reservoir or an air pump, or both.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including for enhancing personal health, hygiene, and appearance, as well as for preventing or treating a variety of diseases and other conditions in humans and in animals.

The formulation of such compositions presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Compositions that contain therapeutic active materials preferably deliver the active at effective levels, avoiding undue chemical degradation. Similarly, compositions containing cosmetically functional materials must deliver the material to the oral cavity at effective levels under the conditions that they are typically used by the consumer.

Moreover, the aesthetic appeal of all such compositions is important, and can have significant effects on consumer acceptance and usage. Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products. Indeed, many such compositions known in the art are deficient in one or more attributes. Thus, there is an ongoing need for new oral care compositions, and methods of their use.

Fluoride is a very well known anti-cavity agent, widely used in toothpaste. However, fluoride use in toothpowder is complicated because of settling issues. In this regard, fluoride needs to be controlled to provide, for instance, a maximum of 1000 parts per million of soluble fluoride ion in some countries and a maximum of 1500 parts per million of soluble fluoride ion in other countries; and settling of a toothpowder fluoride ion source within a toothpowder container is of concern insofar as localized fluoride ion concentrations might be elevated above the acceptable level by such settling. Toothpaste is usually formulated to have a viscosity that preempts such settling in fluoride ion sources within the toothpaste, but toothpowder needs to provide a movable particulate so that the powder can be poured for use.

However, the effectiveness of toothpowder in providing a fluoride ion source is therefore adversely affected because of this challenge respective to the composition and consumer compliance.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides oral care compositions. In somewhat greater detail, the invention is for toothpowder of clinically efficacious fluoride ion source particulate dispersed in an orally acceptable abrasive calcium carbonate particulate bed.

In another aspect, the fluoride ion source particulate is any of particulate sodium monofluorophosphate, particulate sodium fluoride, particulate stannous fluoride, or combinations thereof.

In a further aspect where the fluoride ion source is particulate sodium monofluorophosphate, particulate sodium fluoride, particulate stannous fluoride or combinations thereof, the bed has a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters, at least 99 percent of individual calcium carbonate particles in the bed have an independent calcium carbonate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns, at least 99 percent of individual fluoride ion source particulate particles in the set have an independent fluoride ion source particulate particle size from about 10 to about 150 microns, and any 125 cubic millimeter volumetric portion of the bed has a concentration of fluoride ion source providing from about 500 to about 1500 parts per million of soluble fluoride respective to calcium carbonate.

In further aspects dispersed sodium lauryl sulfate particulate, dispersed saccharin particulate, citric acid, and/or flavor oil are added into the toothpowder as described above.

In yet a further aspect where the fluoride ion source particulate comprises sodium monofluorophosphate, a particulate bed of the toothpowder has a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters and comprises from about 60 to about 98 weight percent calcium carbonate, from about 0.38 to about 1.14 weight percent sodium monofluorophosphate, from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent sodium lauryl sulfate, from about 0.02 to about 0.5 weight percent saccharin, from about 0.05 to about 0.4 weight percent citric acid, and from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent flavor oil.

The invention is also for admixing clinically efficacious fluoride ion source particulate into orally acceptable abrasive particulate according to any of the above-described formulations.

In yet a further aspect the admixing is performed by use of a ribbon blender.

In yet a further aspect the ribbon blender has a first end and a second end and the admixing is performed by charging the blender with the calcium carbonate and continuously adding a first pulverized stream of particulated fluoride ion source material to the first end of the ribbon blender and a second pulverized stream of particulated fluoride ion source material to the second end of the ribbon blender until the particulated fluoride ion source material is admixed into the calcium carbonate particulate.

"BACKGROUND

Structured liquids are known in the art for suspending materials such as beads in liquid cleaning compositions. The methods of providing structure to the liquid includes using particular surfactants to structure the liquid, or by the addition of suspending agents such as polysaccharides, natural gums, or cellulose, that enable the liquid to suspend materials therein for long periods of time. These suspended materials can be functional, non-functional (aesthetic) or both. By aesthetic it is meant that the suspended materials impart a certain visual appearance that is pleasing or eye catching. By functional it is meant that the suspended materials contribute to the action of the composition in cleaning, fragrance release, shine enhancement, or other intended action of the composition.

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to containers for storing and dispensing flowable substances, and more particularly to such containers having multiple product storage compartments or chambers.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are many flowable packaged substances or products on the market today offering many choices to consumers for personal care, oral care, and home care products. Such products may include without limitation body washes, liquid soap, body lotions, shampoos, conditioners, household cleaners, etc. Products within the same category are often available in a variety of formulations, colors, and/or fragrances adding to the type and number of products available. However, products are often packaged alone in a single container. Currently, if consumers want to experience more than one product at any time, several individual containers or bottles of products must generally be purchased and stored so that the desired product is available when needed. The purchase of many individual separate containers to obtain the variety of products desired may become a costly proposition and cumbersome to store.

An improved container is desired that provides multiple dispensable products or substances in a single convenient container.

SUMMARY OF INVENTION

A container according to exemplary embodiments of the present invention allows a user to have choice of multiple products in single convenient bottle and dispense only the desired product in lieu of purchasing multiple separate product bottles. In one embodiment, the container incorporates a plurality of individual compartments or chambers into a single unitary structure configured to separately store and selectively dispense multiple flowable products or substances. According to some embodiments, the multi-chambered container preferably provides for the simultaneous storage and dispensing of at least two, and more preferably more than two different types and/or variations of flowable substances from the single container.

A dispensing system incorporated in a multi-chambered container according to embodiments of the present invention, as further described herein, allows the user to selectively dispense the contents of only a single chamber at a given time while precluding products/substances being simultaneously dispensed unintentionally from the other non-selected chambers. In one embodiment, the container includes a flexible sidewall, and is configured and adapted to allow the user to dispense the contents of a single chamber by applying an inward squeezing or pressing force on the container preferably with the hand, thumb, and/or fingers. In some preferred embodiments, the chambers are arranged and stacked vertically when the multi-chambered container is viewed oriented in a lengthwise vertical or upright standing position. This arrangement facilitates a user dispensing one flowable substance from one of the chambers by squeezing the desired chamber at the exclusion of dispensing the remaining substances from the non-selected chambers. Embodiments of the multi-chambered container may also be configured and adapted to allow the chambers to be refillable by the user.

According to one embodiment, a multi-chambered container for selectively dispensing flowable substances includes a first chamber adapted for storing and dispensing a first flowable substance, and a second chamber adapted for storing and dispensing a second flowable substance. In a preferred embodiment, the first and second chambers include flexible sidewalls. The container further includes a common discharge valve assembly in fluid communication with the first and second chambers. The valve assembly is preferably configured and adapted to selectively dispense a single one of the first or second flowable substances in response to application of an inward pressing force on the first or second chamber sidewalls without simultaneously dispensing the remaining substance. In one possible embodiment, the container further includes a third chamber adapted for storing and dispensing a third flowable substance: the third chamber being in fluid communication with the common discharge valve assembly. In this embodiment, the valve assembly is further configured and adapted to selectively dispense a single one of the first, second, or third flowable substances without simultaneously dispensing the remaining substances. In other embodiments, the valve assembly further includes an inlet flow manifold fluidly coupled to each of the chambers and a flexible discharge valve.

The multi-chambered container described herein may be used to store and dispense any flowable substance including liquids or fluids of any viscosity so long as the substance is able to flow. Accordingly, the term “flowable substance” shall be construed to mean any product or material capable of flowing including, but not limited to paste, soap, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, perfume and the like.

The foregoing and other aspects of exemplary embodiments formed according to principles of the present invention are further described herein.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, having a handle constructed of multiple components and/or materials.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, are mass-produced articles and must therefore allow cost-effective production. Toothbrushes made of a single plastic material and toothbrushes made of two plastic components, which are produced for example by a two component injection molding process, are known. In the latter case, known toothbrushes generally comprise two parts: a first part made of a hard plastic material, for example polypropylene; and a second part made of a resilient plastic material, for example a thermoplastic elastomer. Typically, the first part, which is made of the hard plastic material, forms the structural portion of the handle and has a recess or channel formed therein. This recess is filled with the resilient plastic material, thereby forming the second part which acts as a gripping surface or cover.

The hard plastic and the resilient soft plastic are selected so that they bond with one another at the surface where the two plastic parts touch. In comparison with a toothbrush made of only one plastic material, this provides greater scope for design. Since, however, the two plastic materials have to bond with one another during the injection-molding operation, there are restrictions in the selection of the plastic materials and consequently in the design of the toothbrush.

One solution to the limitation that two plastic materials must bond with one another during the injection molding operation has been introduced by which a handle can be formed by two plastics that do not chemically bond within one another during the injection molding operation but rather utilize a mechanical connection, such as by inter-fitting portions of the two plastic components or by shrinking one plastic component about the other. With respect to creating a two component toothbrush having a grip cover over a hard plastic body, this known method is limited in its design capability to a tubular sleeve that receives a cylindrical core structure within its cavity so as to circumferentially surround the entire circumference of the cylindrical core structure. This arrangement is limiting in both possible designs for the handle and the fact that the resulting handle must either be bulky or sacrifice strength.

Another oral care implement having a multi-component handle that is known in the art includes a gripping region having a thermoplastic elastomer (“TPE”) grip surface with a plurality of spaced slot openings exposing portions of a hard plastic base. This handle also includes an inclined portion and a soft TPE grip body extending through the hard plastic base of the handle to form opposite finger grips on the inclined portion of the handle. This soft grip body provides shifting of a mass centroid during use. In this construction, the handle of the oral care implement comprises three components, a hard plastic handle body, a grip cover/surface formed of a first TPE, and a grip body formed of a second TPE which is softer than the first TPE.

A need exists for an oral care implement, and method of manufacturing the same, that has a handle having greater design flexibility, is more cost-effective to mass produce, and/or affords comfort and control to the user during use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the invention is directed to an oral care implement having a multi-component handle constructed of at least four components constructed of different materials. In another aspect, the invention is directed to an oral care implement having a multi-component handle having a core structure, an elongated handle structure at least partially surrounding the core structure, and a grip cover strategically located on the elongated handle body to conceal through holes in the elongated body resulting from supporting the core structure during the injection molding process.

In one embodiment, the invention may be an oral care implement comprising: a handle having a proximal end and a distal end; a head connected to the distal end of the handle; the handle comprising a first component constructed of a first material, a second component constructed of a second material, a third component constructed of a third material and a fourth component constructed of a fourth material.

In another embodiment, the invention may be an oral care implement comprising: a head; a handle having a distal end and a proximal end, the head connected to the distal end of the handle; the handle comprising a core structure constructed of a first rigid material and an elongated handle body constructed of a second rigid material, the core structure disposed within a through slot of the elongated handle body so that the core structure is exposed on opposite lateral surfaces of the handle; and a grip cover constructed of a resilient material, the grip cover covering a front surface, a rear surface and a proximal end surface of the elongated handle body.

In a further embodiment, the invention may be an oral care implement comprising: a head; a handle having a distal end and a proximal end, the head connected to the distal end of the handle; the handle comprising a core structure constructed of a first rigid material and an elongated handle body constructed of a second rigid material that does not form a chemical bond with the first material during an injection molding process; the core structure disposed within a through slot of the elongated handle body so that the core structure is exposed on opposite surfaces of the handle; at least one through hole on a first surface of the elongated handle body through which the core structure is exposed and at least one through hole on a second surface of the elongated handle body through which the core structure is exposed, the second surface opposite the first surface; the core structure comprising a first protuberance that extends into the through hole on the first surface of the elongated handle body and a second protuberance that extends into the through hole on the second surface of the elongated handle body; and a grip cover constructed of a resilient material covering the through hole on the first surface of the elongated handle body and the through hole on the second surface of the elongated handle body, the resilient material forming a chemical bond with the second material during an injection molding process.

In a yet further embodiment, the invention may be a method of forming a handle for an oral care implement comprising: a) injecting a liquefied first plastic into a first mold cavity to form a core structure of the first plastic; b) supporting the core structure within a second mold cavity with a gripping member that contacts the core structure at two or more points of contact on opposite surfaces of the core structure; c) injecting a liquefied second plastic into the second mold cavity to form an elongated handle body that at least partially surrounds the core structure, thereby forming a handle assembly, the elongated handle body surrounding the gripping member resulting in a through hole in the elongated handle body for each point of contact, the points of contact exposed via the through holes; d) supporting the handle assembly in a third mold cavity; and e) injecting a liquefied resilient material into the third mold cavity to form a grip cover over the elongated handle body, the grip cover overlying the through holes.

In still a further embodiment, the invention may be an oral care implement comprising: a head; a handle having a distal end and a proximal end, the head connected to the distal end of the handle; the handle comprising a core structure constructed of a transparent rigid material and an elongated handle body constructed of an opaque rigid material; the core structure disposed within a through slot of the elongated handle body so that the core structure is exposed on opposite surfaces of the handle so as to form a window through the handle; and a plurality of facets formed into an interior of the core structure that are visible through the window and reflect visible light.

"FIELD

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleaner and a releasable material for engaging tissue of the mouth.

BACKGROUND

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can lead to bad breath or oral malodor.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, they have generally not been effective, easy to use, or socially acceptable for use in a public setting. Further, many of these scrapers cannot easily be used to cleanse other tissue within the mouth. Notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by cleaning the tissue in the mouth, many users avoid the use of such cleaners due to a lack of comfort and/or ease of use.

In addition, it has not been convenient or socially acceptable for users to clean their tongues and other soft tissue in the mouth in public settings, on the go or, away from home.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleaner that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris, maintains comfort to the user, provides a substance to treat tissues of the mouth, is easy to use, and is socially acceptable and convenient in public settings or on the go. There is also a need for an oral implement which combines the cleaning effects of a tissue cleaner and medicament.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement includes a tissue cleaner which provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, a releasable material is supported by an insoluble tissue cleaner that includes at least one tissue engaging element for cleaning tissue surfaces in the mouth. The tissue engaging element(s) may be rubbed along the oral tissue to remove bacteria and debris while a chemical of the releasable material is released into the mouth of a user. In one preferred embodiment, the releasable material is provided as an antiseptic and/or breath freshener for enhanced cleaning and freshening of the mouth.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleaner is composed of an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleaner is formed as an elastomeric molded element provided with a plurality of exterior nubs. The tissue cleaner may include an interior or an exterior supporting surface of an oral medicament.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a cavity to hold an oral medicament for ease of releasing the medicament into the mouth.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement resembles a lollipop for convenience, ease of use and social acceptance. In one preferred embodiment, the tongue cleaner and/or medicament has a disk shape and is mounted on the end of a stick.

In another aspect of the invention, a chemical is incorporated into the material of a tissue cleaner. In one preferred embodiment, the chemical is released from the tissue cleaner for creating a sensory response to the tissues inside of the mouth of a user.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush that releases a chemical into the mouth during use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of had breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria.

In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can lead to bad breath or oral malodor.

While consumers may seek to clean their tongue or teeth, there has not been a toothbrush which provides a chemical sensory response in a mouth to enhance a user's brushing experience. Further, consumers have not been provided with a visual method to select a toothbrush which provides a sensory response.

"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/060633, filed 16 Dec. 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/289,433, filed on 23 Dec. 2009, which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

There have been several forms of antiperspirant products, such as sticks, soft solids, roll-ons, and aerosols. The antiperspirant products may additionally contain deodorant actives. The different forms deliver antiperspirant actives, and optionally deodorant actives, to axillary areas. There can be disadvantages when formulating these types of products.

One disadvantage is that when an antiperspirant active is included, steps need to be taken to stabilize the antiperspirant from hydrolyzing and polymerizing during storage. When an antiperspirant polymerizes into larger species, the efficacy is reduced.

Another disadvantage is that materials used for delivery, such as in the sticks or soft solids, can leave a white residue on the skin. This can be aesthetically unpleasing when seen on skin or when transferred to clothing during wearing.

It would be advantageous to develop a new form of delivery of antiperspirant and/or deodorant actives.

SUMMARY

Provided is an aqueous antiperspirant/deodorant composition comprising: (a) at least one active chosen from an antiperspirant active and a deodorant active, (b) a mixture comprising at least one basic compound chosen from a basic amide and a basic amine and a counterpart material for the basic amide and/or basic amine, and (c) at least 10 weight % water.

Also provided is a method of producing an aqueous antiperspirant composition, the method comprising the steps of (a) providing a composition of at least one active chosen from an antiperspirant active and a deodorant active, a mixture comprising at least one basic compound chosen from a basic amide and a basic amine and a counterpart material for the basic amide and/or basic amine, and at least 10 weight % water; and (b) heating the composition to form a stabilized system of the at least one active, the mixture, and water.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, that include movable cleaning features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle, the head having a base structure having a first face; a first pod extending from the first face of the base structure and comprising a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the first pod; a second pod extending from the first face of the base structure and comprising a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the second pod; and a third pod disposed between the first and second pods, the third pod supported above the first face by the first pod, the second pod, and at least one suspension member, a gap existing between a bottom surface of the third pod and the first face of the base structure, a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the third pod; wherein a top portion of the first pod, a top portion of the second pod, the third pod, and the at least one suspension member are formed as a unitary assembly that is subsequently attached to the base structure.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle, the head having a base structure having a first face; a unitary assembly comprising: a top portion of a first pod; a top portion of a second pod; a third pod comprising a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the third pod; and at least one suspension member; the unitary assembly attached to the base structure so that: the first pod extends from the first face of the base structure; the second pod extends from the first face of the base structure; and the third pod is disposed between the first and second pods, the third pod is supported above the first face by the first pod, the second pod, and at least one suspension member so that a gap exists between a bottom surface of the third pod and the first face of the base structure.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be a method of forming an oral care implement having a handle and a head comprising: a) forming a unitary assembly comprising a top portion of a first pod, a top portion of a second pod, a third pod comprising a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the third pod, and at least one suspension member; and b) attaching the unitary assembly to a base structure of the head to form the first pod extending from a first face of the base structure and the second pod extending from the first face of the base structure, and the third pod is disposed between the first and second pods, the third pod is supported above the first face by the first pod, the second pod, and at least one suspension member so that a gap exists between a bottom surface of the third pod and the first face of the base structure.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant salts, such as aluminum chlorohydrex (also called aluminum chlorohydrex polymeric salts and abbreviated here as “ACH”) and aluminum zirconium glycine salts (abbreviated here as “ZAG”, “ZAG complexes” or “AZG”), are known to contain a variety of polymeric and oligomeric species with molecular weights (MW) of 100-500,000. It has been clinically shown that, in general, the smaller the species, the higher the efficacy for reducing sweat.

In an attempt to increase the quality and quantity of smaller aluminum and/or zirconium species, a number of efforts have focused on: (1) how to select the components of ACH and ZAG that affect the performance of these materials as antiperspirants; and (2) how to manipulate these components to obtain and/or maintain the presence of smaller types of these components. These attempts have included the development of analytical techniques to identify the components. Size exclusion chromatography (“SEC”) or gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”) are methods frequently used for obtaining information on polymer distribution in antiperspirant salt solutions. With appropriate chromatographic columns, generally five distinctive groups of polymer species can be detected in commercial ACH and ZAG complexes appearing in a chromatogram as peaks 1, 2, 3, 4 and a peak known as “5,6”. Peak 1 is the larger Zr species (greater than 60 Angstroms). Peaks 2 and 3 are larger aluminum species. Peak 4 is smaller aluminum species (aluminum oligomers, or small aluminum cluster) and has been correlated with enhanced efficacy for both Al and Al/Zr salts. Peak 5, 6 is the smallest aluminum species. Various analytical approaches for characterizing the peaks of ACH and various types of ZAG actives are found in “Antiperspirant Actives—Enhanced Efficacy Aluminum-Zirconium-Glycine (AZG) Salts” by Dr. Allan H. Rosenberg (Cosmetics and Toiletries Worldwide, Fondots, D. C. ed., Hartfordshire, UK: Aston Publishing Group, 1993, pages 252, 254-256).

Attempts to activate antiperspirant salts to produce materials having improved efficacy have included developing processes for obtaining composition having large amounts of Peak 4 species. None of these efforts, however, have resulted in an antiperspirant composition having a composition with little or no Peak 3 and optionally little or no Peak 5.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides for an antiperspirant active composition comprising an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, exhibiting a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution, and optionally including zirconium.

The present invention also provides for a method of making an antiperspirant active composition that exhibits a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution comprising:I) heating an aqueous solution containing an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, optionally with a buffer agent, at a temperature of about 50° C. to about 95° C. to reflux for a period of time of about 1 hour to about 5 hours to obtain an aluminum salt solution;II) adding an aqueous solution of an inorganic base to obtain an aluminum salt solution having an OH:Al molar ratio of about 2:1 to about 2.6:1 to obtain a pH adjusted aluminum salt solution having a pH of about 2 to about 5; andIII) optionally adding an aqueous solution containing a zirconium compound to the pH adjusted aluminum salt solution to thereby obtain an aluminum-zirconium salt solution having a molar ratio of aluminum to zirconium of about 5:1 to about 10:1.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries is a major dental disease that affects the majority of the population. In the early part of the 20thcentury, investigators discovered that fluoride was effective in reducing the incidence of caries. Since that time, fluoride research has developed, and it is now well accepted that fluoride treatments benefit dental health.

Most dentifrice compositions contain fluoride ions in the range of 1,000 to 1,500 ppm. However, for some segments of the population, higher amounts of fluoride may be even more beneficial. Some patients often suffer from either aggressive caries, or are otherwise at a higher risk of dental decay than the general population. Other patients suffer from xerostomia, or tooth sensitivity. These patients may benefit from special dentifrices that incorporate high levels of fluoride ions. For example, some such dentifrices incorporate sodium fluoride as a fluoride ion source, in amounts of over 1,500 ppm, such as around 2,000 ppm or around 5,000 ppm.

However, it may be difficult to maintain the effective properties of high levels of fluoride in oral care compositions. Fluoride ion sources may have low solubility, fluoride ions may precipitate out of a dentifrice composition and fluoride ions may react with other ingredients in a dentifrice composition. On the other hand, if more solvent is added to the composition to increase fluoride ion availability, the composition changes and tends to lose the desirable physical characteristics associated with an acceptable dentifrice, e.g., the viscosity of the compositions may be too thin and runny.

The use of mucoadhesive polymers in combination with fluoride is known in the art. However, ionic salts, including fluoride ions known to interact and become entrapped in multiple polymers, causes a reduction of available fluoride ions. Additionally, typical toothpaste compositions containing mucoadhesive polymers may experience undesirable “stickiness” or “tackiness” in the mouth following use.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a high-fluoride content oral care compositions, e.g., for patients who need high levels of fluoride, e.g., those suffering from xerostomia and/or tooth sensitivity. It is further desirable to develop such a composition in which the anticaries activity of the fluoride ion is maintained successfully over time. It is also desirable to develop compositions which do not result in a sticky or tacky sensation following use, and provides a smooth feel during and after brushing.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that fluoride ion availability is maintained in high level fluoride compositions comprising a hydrocolloid, heteropolysaccharide, and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic anhydride (PVME/MA) copolymer. One aspect of the present invention is directed to compositions which provide greater than 90% fluoride recovery, e.g., greater than 95% fluoride recovery.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on surfaces of the oral cavity, such as tissue and teeth, and comprises a complex mixture of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products, starch, proteins and proteinacious material. Thus, inhibiting the growth of bio-film not only involves dispersing the accumulation of existing proteinacious materials, but also requires prohibiting and minimizing their reattachment to the tooth surface. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity (e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like). Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

Bacteria thrive on the tongue. For the most part, the bacteria are a part of a protective bio-film that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.

A wide variety of agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. In spite of the extensive amount of products related to antibacterial dentifrice and related oral treatment compositions, there is still a need for a product with enhanced bacteria anti-attachment properties.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A composite comprising a silicone compound sorbed onto a porous cross-linked polymer.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features, as well as methods for constructing the same.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and or mechanically driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. According to aspects of the invention, an oral care implement can be provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head including cleaning elements attached to a carrier that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements can include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements.

Oral care implement configurations according to the invention can be multi-functional and can include various features in advantageous combinations. Some configurations can include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The configurations can be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

One oral care implement configuration according to aspects of the invention includes a head frame and a cleaning elements assembly attached thereto with tooth cleaning elements extending from carriers of the assembly. One or more central carriers can be suspended via a flexible bridge between a pair of support carriers of the assembly that can be attached to the head frame. The bridge can be formed from an elastomer that permits the one or more central carriers to move from an initial position toward the head frame during use. The carriers and the bridge can be formed as a unitary assembly attached to the head frame, such as via mechanical connections. The mechanical connections could include snap-fit connections.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a class of compounds, and especially a group of fragrance precursor compounds which are used for creating a fragrance effect, preferably on surfaces such as fibers, skin, hair and hard surfaces. More specifically, the invention relates to a group of fragrance precursor compounds that break down on the above outlined surfaces, and as a result of this release perfume. In preferred embodiments the invention relates to certain hemiacetal and acetal compounds. Since the perfume or fragrance is only released when the compounds of the invention are broken down, the compounds of the invention are capable of providing a long-lasting fragrance effect. That is, the compounds of the present invention provide for a sustained release of fragrances.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing these precursor compounds. Fragrance precursor compounds consist of fragrance raw materials and functional compounds such as surfactants, polymers etc., which provide benefits such as surface protection, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning.

In addition, the present invention relates to compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, and to fragrance raw material delivery systems which provide extended fragrance benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In WO-00/72816, fragrance delivery systems are described which comprise pro-fragrances or pro-accords selected from at least two of the following: (i) aldehyde and ketone releasing pro-fragrances, which pro-fragrances comprise inter alia and preferably oxazolidines; (ii) β-amino pro-fragrances; and (iii) orthoester pro-accords. The pro-fragrances described are capable of delivering fragrance raw material aldehydes and ketones to especially the human skin. More in detail, said international patent application is based on the finding that certain aldehyde fragrance raw materials, such as para-t-bucinal, cymal and lillial can be controllably released from particular heterocyclic pro-fragrances to especially the skin.

In laundry products, such as fabric softeners or detergents, generally perfume additives are present which make the said products more aesthetically pleasing to the consumers. The product should not only smell pleasantly and in that way add to the purchase perception, but also impart a pleasant and preferably long lasting fragrance to the fibers or fabrics treated therewith. One of the problems the person skilled in the art is confronted with is that the amount of perfume carryover is rather marginal; much fragrance is lost during washing and disappears down the drain. It would be very desirable to find ways of more effectively delivering perfume or fragrances to fibers, fabrics and textiles and to achieve the fragrance effect for a longer period of time.

Colgate-Palmolive application WO 02/057400 describes a water soluble cross-linked cationic polymer derived from the polymerisation of from 5 to 100 mole percent of a cationic vinyl addition monomer, from 0 to 95 mole percent of acrylamide, and from 70 to 300 ppm of a difunctional vinyl addition monomer cross-linking agent which enhances fragrance delivery from a fabric softening composition to the fabric to be softened.

In copending Colgate-Palmolive U.S. application Ser. No. 9/893,117, filed Jun. 27, 2001, there is described a fabric care composition comprising a cationic softening compound; a non-confined fragrance oil; and at least one fabric or skin beneficiating ingredient such as a fragrance oil, contained within pressure sensitive microcapsules to provide enhanced delivery of such beneficiating ingredient to the fabric.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION

The first objective of the present invention is to provide alternative fragrances precursors or pro-fragrances.

It is another objective to provide a more efficient delivery system of fragrance or perfume to surfaces.

It is a further objective to provide functional fragrance precursor compounds that impart long lasting fragrance benefits, especially to fiber containing materials, such as fabrics and laundry.

Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a controlled or sustained release system releasing fragrance for a longer period of time.

Yet a further objective is to provide consumer product compositions which are capable to provide sustained release of fragrance.

Other objectives will become apparent from reading the following description and are especially obtained for laundry products, personal care products, hard surface care products, oral products and so on.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many individuals desire a “bright” smile and white teeth, and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material. Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque. The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.

There are a variety of compositions described in the art for preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The materials most commonly used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Peroxides are generally deemed safe from a physiological standpoint, and can be effective to whiten teeth.

Professional dental treatments frequently include a tooth surface preparation such as acid etching followed by the application of highly concentrated bleaching solutions (e.g., up to 37% hydrogen peroxide) and/or the application of heat or light. These procedures provide rapid results, but are expensive, and often require several trips to the dentist. Alternatively, at-home bleaching systems can be used. These systems have gained significant popularity in the past decade because of reduced cost, and increased convenience. Instead of time consuming and frequent trips to the dentist, the tooth whitener is purchased at a consumer retail store and may be easily integrated into the daily hygiene program. At-home treatment methods include whitening strips, abrasive toothpastes, and toothpastes that contain peroxides. These peroxide toothpastes require the use of a dual chamber system that separates the peroxide from other ingredients. If the contents of the two chambers are mixed prematurely, the oxidation activity and whitening benefits are lost.

It would be desirable to provide a whitening oral care composition which promotes consumer compliance and utilizes a single chamber or tube to deliver sufficient amounts of whitening ingredients and other oral care actives without adverse reaction between the ingredients.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides a single phase whitening dentifrice that includes (i) a whitening agent selected from the group consisting of hydrogen peroxide, a bound peroxide and a solid peroxide (ii) an abrasive and (iii) a substantially anhydrous orally acceptable carrier, for example, polyethylene glycol. The bound peroxide may be hydrogen peroxide and a polymer and/or any peroxide compound and a porous cross-linked polymer, such as polymers of polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylates, a polymethacrylates, and a polyitaconates. The solid peroxide may be sodium perborate or urea hydroxide.

The invention also provides methods of whitening the tooth surfaces by contacting the surface with the composition.

"The present invention relates to toothpowder oral care compositions and methods. In particular, the present invention includes toothpowder compositions and methods for making natural calcium carbonate toothpowder that provide a coating of flavor oil on the natural calcium carbonate particles.

Oral care compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including for enhancing personal health, hygiene, and appearance, as well as for preventing or treating a variety of diseases and other conditions in humans and in animals.

The formulation of such compositions presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Compositions that contain therapeutic active materials preferably deliver the active at effective levels, avoiding undue chemical degradation. Similarly, compositions containing cosmetically functional materials must deliver the material to the oral cavity at effective levels under the conditions that they are typically used by the consumer.

Moreover, the aesthetic appeal of all such compositions is important, and can have significant effects on consumer acceptance and usage. Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products. Indeed, many such compositions known in the art are deficient in one or more attributes. Thus, there is an ongoing need for new oral care compositions, and methods of their use.

One form of oral care composition is a tooth powder. Traditionally, toothpowder has used a combination of precipitated calcium carbonate, natural calcium carbonate, and refined natural calcium carbonate. Flavor oil is added to the precipitated calcium carbonate prior to admixing of the flavor-enhanced precipitated calcium carbonate with the natural calcium carbonate and refined natural calcium carbonate since oil absorption of precipitated calcium carbonate is substantially greater than oil absorption of natural calcium carbonate and/or refined natural calcium carbonate.

However, the effectiveness of toothpowder in providing a pleasant flavor is adversely affected because the precipitated calcium carbonate doesn't fully release flavorant absorbed into it during a normal tooth brushing operation. Furthermore, precipitated calcium carbonate is less cost-effective than natural calcium carbonate in providing the desired abrasive properties of the toothpowder.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides oral care compositions. In somewhat greater detail, the invention is for toothpowder, comprising:

(a) from about 85 to about 100 weight percent particulated natural calcium carbonate where the particulated natural calcium carbonate comprises a set of natural calcium carbonate particles having a set of calcium carbonate surfaces; and

(b) flavor oil coating on a majority of calcium carbonate surfaces in the set of natural calcium carbonate surfaces.

In a further aspect, at least 95 percent of individual natural calcium carbonate particles in the set of natural calcium carbonate particles have an independent calcium carbonate particle size from about 1 to about 150 microns, the flavor oil coating on the particulated natural calcium carbonate provides coated particulate, and the flavor oil coating comprises from about 0.1 to about 5 weight percent of the coated particulate.

In yet further aspects, the toothpowder further optionally comprises any of dispersed sodium lauryl sulfate particulate, dispersed saccharin particulate, citric acid, and/or dispersed particulated sodium monofluorophosphate.

In one aspect, a particulate bed of the toothpowder has a volume of at least 125 cubic millimeters and comprises from about 85 to about 98 weight percent natural calcium carbonate, from about 0.38 to about 1.14 weight percent sodium monofluorophosphate, from about 0.5 to about 3.5 weight percent sodium lauryl sulfate, from about 0.02 to about 0.5 weight percent saccharin, from about 0.05 to about 0.4 weight percent citric acid, and from about 0.5 to about 5 weight percent flavor oil.

The invention also provides a method for making toothpowder according to any of the above compositional formulations by agitating a bed of particulated calcium carbonate to provide an agitated bed of not less than 85 weight percent natural calcium carbonate and admixing nebulized flavor oil into the agitated bed to provide coated natural calcium carbonate. The agitated bed of natural calcium carbonate has a volumetric circulation rate and a bed shear rate, and the admixing meters the nebulized flavor oil into the agitated bed at a volumetric rate sufficient, at the volumetric circulation rate and at the bed shear rate, for essentially precluding formation of agglomerated particles of the coated natural calcium carbonate.

In one aspect, the agitating is performed by use of a ribbon blender. In another aspect, flavor oil is nebulized with a spray nozzle to provide the nebulized flavor oil. In another aspect (where the ribbon blender has a housing defining an internal cavity, a spray nozzle is positioned to spray within the internal cavity, and a flavor oil supply is in fluid communication with the spray nozzle) the method further comprises feeding, during the agitating, flavor oil through the spray nozzle from the flavor oil supply to nebulize the flavor oil into the nebulized flavor oil having droplets of from about 5 to about 20 microns.

In one aspect, the agitated bed is kept at a temperature of from about 20 degrees Celsius to about 60 degrees Celsius. It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art.

Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating embodiments of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a method of stripping paint and ink from a substrate. The stripper comprises an aqueous phase and an organic phase.

With the introduction of new and more durable types of synthetic resins and polymers in protective and decorative coatings, the problem of stripping has become increasingly difficult. Prior art paint removers typically contain blends of aromatic solvents, ketones, paraffin, methanol and diluents, for example, mineral spirits in order to reduce raw material costs. Those prior art strippers made with the foregoing solvents focused industry attention on the flammable and toxic characteristics.

As an alternative, improved prior art solvents utilize chlorinated solvents as a way to extend the usefulness of paint strippers while simultaneously reducing fire hazards associated with their use. Methylene chloride (dichloromethane) has been almost universally used as the solvent of choice, although some compositions have been formulated with ethylene dichloride and trichloroethylene, among other chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents. Many of the chlorinated hydrocarbons including methylene chloride are suspected carcinogens and methylene chloride is designated a hazardous substance under the Federal Hazardous Substance Act (FHSA). In addition, methylene chloride, as a high vapor pressure chlorinated solvent, probably contributes to atmospheric ozone depletion. Methanol is a poison if ingested and the U.S. Consumer Products Safety Commission requires a warning designating it as a poison when its concentration in consumer products exceeds 4 percent by weight. Toluene contains trace quantities of benzene, a known carcinogen, and acetone with its high vapor pressure and low flash point is highly flammable.

Paint strippers which include methylene chloride can be formulated to soften, lift and blister paint films. The stripper which is applied to the substrate by brush, immersion or spray and allowed to loosen the paint or varnish has an available work life of only several minutes because of the tendency of the methylene chloride to evaporate rapidly. Because of the high vapor pressure of methylene chloride, in an effort to extend the work life of the stripper made with that solvent, paraffin is often included as an evaporation suppressant. The paraffin functions by forming a thin film at the surface of the paint remover which retards evaporation. This thin film formation and resultant evaporation suppressant activity of paraffin is produced by the evaporation and surface chilling which occur when methylene chloride or mixtures containing methylene chloride are exposed to air. However, methylene chloride strippers must be handled carefully since they are highly toxic and can cause severe skin irritation. Further, even with the incorporation of paraffin, the volatility of the methylene chloride is still very high and when methylene chloride is formulated with, for example, toluene, the resulting high levels of hydrocarbon emissions necessitate the provision of good ventilation to safely use the methylene chloride paint strippers.

A further disadvantage of paint strippers formulated with methylene chloride is that the short work life compromises the ability of the stripper to function efficiently in many applications. For example, many industrial uses of paint strippers involve stripping accumulated paint from equipment and walls. Paint strippers utilizing methylene chloride suffer from the disadvantage that the short work life prevents the stripper from entering crevices in the accumulated paint layers thus creating the necessity, in some cases, of applying a large number of applications of stripper to remove a number of accumulated paint layers.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107, issued Feb. 19, 2002, discloses a new method of stripping paint from a painted substrate surface. According to the invention, the surface is contacted with the aqueous phase of a two-phase liquid stripper composition comprising an aqueous phase which comprises water, dissolved water-soluble activator compound, and an organic solvent which has a solubility in water in the range 0.1 to 10% by weight at 20° C., the organic solvent being present in the aqueous phase at a concentration of about the saturation level (as at the ambient conditions for the method) and comprising also an organic phase comprising the said organic solvent, which organic phase is in interfacial contact with the aqueous phase. The organic solvent may include chlorinated hydrocarbons, for instance in combination with other organic solvents.

Suitable organic solvents for use in U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107 include benzyl alcohol, methylene chloride, dibasic ester, which is an oxygenated solvent composed of a mixture of methyldiesters of glutaric, succinic and adipic acids, or ethyl-3-ethoxy propionate. The dissolved activator compound present in the aqueous phase of the composition may be any compound which increases the paint stripper activity. Such compound may often be a pH modifying compound in the form of an acid. Acid activators are usually organic acids, for instance trichloroacetic, alkyl benzene sulphonic acid, benzoic or lactic acid. The pH modifying compound can also be an alkali, for instance, alkali metal hydroxides, alkaline earth metal hydroxides, alkali metal silicates, and organic basic compounds such as amines or ammonium compounds. Another category of activator compound is an oxidizing agent. Examples of an oxidizing agent include hydrogen peroxide and potassium permanganate.

It is known to use water as an activator compound in organic solvent based paint strippers. Such compositions tend to have low levels of water, for instance less than 10%. Other paint stripper compositions comprising both water and organic solvents which are immiscible with water have been described. Generally emulsifiers are added in quantities such that an emulsion of one phase in the other phase is formed. Such emulsions are storage stable and are required not to separate before use. Alternatively, co-solvents may be added to create a homogeneous single phase system.

Single phase paint strippers containing ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate and additional solvents such as esters, ethers, alcohols, or pyrrolidones such as N-methylpyrrolidone are known and exemplified by U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,288,335 and 5,449,474. Alkylene carbonate solvents, along with hydrogen peroxide, in an aqueous-based system are disclosed in a series of patents assigned to Huntsman Petrochemical Corporation. Examples of these are U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,040,284; 6,162,776; 6,369,009; and 6,608,012, among others.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a paint and ink remover composition in the form of two phases: an organic phase and an aqueous phase. Preferably, the phases are separated, but in interfacial contact as in aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 6,348,107. The immiscible (i.e., only partially soluble) organic solvent and water are not in the form of an emulsion, but still provide a very effective paint and ink stripper. Additionally, an acceptable paint and ink remover can be obtained by mixing the two phases and including hydrotropes to provide a single-phase system.

The organic phase comprises a mixture of organic solvents, including an alkylene carbonate, dibasic esters, and alcohol, while the aqueous phase includes a unique basic activator comprising aminoalkyl alkanols, which have previously been used as an ingredient in metal working fluids. The amino alcohol activators of the present invention have not been classified as hazardous pollutants. This invention relates to an environmentally friendly and extremely effective paint and ink remover compared to the prior art.

"BACKGROUND

Antiperspirant or deodorant formulations have been developed with a range of different product forms. One of these is a so-called “stick” which is usually a bar of an apparently firm solid material held within a dispensing container and which retains its structural integrity and shape whilst being applied. When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface, a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface. Payout, of a deodorant stick, describes the weight lost to a surface from a typical application of the deodorant stick. This attribute and other rheological properties are considerations when developing new stick deodorant products. Therefore, a controlled method and device for measuring such properties is desirable.

An amorphous sugar or combinations of amorphous sugars can also completely replace crystalline sugar or be added separately from crystalline sugar in the production of a chocolate product or composition. In a further embodiment, amorphous sugar is combined with milk solids, cocoa solids and/or fruit purees or extracts, dried to a glass state having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least room temperature and incorporated into a cocoa-containing product or chocolate. The invention further relates to methods of producing confectionery, food, and chocolate compositions containing amorphous sugar, where the amorphous structure can be detected in the composition.

BACKGROUND

Chocolate compositions are typically produced using crystalline sugar, such as sucrose. Amorphous sugar is not used in the production of chocolate because of its water content. (Industrial Chocolate Manufacture and Use, 3d Ed., S. T. Beckett, ed., 1999, at 45). Also, amorphous sugar is capable of absorbing water from the environment and other chocolate ingredients, creating potential difficulties during processing and storage. For example, Minifie notes that anhydrous corn syrup is very hygroscopic and can cause trouble with moisture absorption during refining. (Bernard W. Minifie, Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d ed., Aspen Publishers, Inc., 1999, at 136). Furthermore, the amorphous state can be unstable, and amorphous sugars, such as sucrose, dextrose of lactose, tend to rapidly crystallize in the presence of moisture and/or release moisture from crystallization, which can negatively impact the interaction with other components. In addition, the addition of water to chocolate compositions results in an unacceptable gummy texture in the mouth. Small amounts of added water can cause severe rheological changes in the product and can lead to an unacceptable eating texture. (see Minifie, Chocolate, Cocoa, and Confectionery, 3d ed., Aspen Publishers, Inc., 1999). Contrary to these observations, the present invention demonstrates that the full or partial replacement of crystalline sugar with amorphous sugar can produce acceptable chocolate compositions with the same behavior as conventional chocolate compositions. Some of the achievable benefits of replacing with amorphous sugar are a cost reduction, a decrease in calories, or a higher resistance to oil migration, for example in a peanut butter filled chocolate composition, and/or a higher resistance to water migration.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In a general aspect, the invention relates to novel food, confectionery, and especially chocolate compositions, and methods of producing them, where an amorphous sugar, such as a corn syrup solid, wholly or partially replaces a crystalline sugar ingredient. In one aspect or embodiment, an amorphous sugar is combined with cocoa solids, milk solids or fruit purees or extracts and incorporated into a chocolate product or composition. The chocolate products or compositions can be used as coatings, fillers, enrobing compositions, or other ingredients in a finished or final food or confectionery product. In a further aspect or embodiment, the invention relates to a chocolate composition comprising amorphous sugar and crystallized sugar, wherein the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystallized sugar is such that the combination of amorphous sugar and crystallized sugar has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature. In general, the amorphous sugar is detectable in the final product or composition and characteristic microstructures of the chocolate compositions in particular are defined below. Some of the many benefits of the invention include cost reduction, a decrease in calories, and/or a higher resistance to oil or water migration in food, chocolate, or confectionery products and during the storage of them.

In another general aspect, the invention encompasses the use of a characteristic glass transition temperature at different moisture contents for a variety of ratios of crystalline sugar:amorphous sugar in chocolate compositions, as well as the use of related information to modify the properties and contents of food products and compositions and/or improve manufacturing conditions or manufactured products. The resulting improvements and implications on food manufacturing and preparation systems allows one of ordinary skill in the art to, for example, vary compositions from a glassy to a rubbery state, modify the water content of foods and related compositions, and modify the processing conditions for food and especially chocolate products. Advantageously, water can be used to a higher extent than in conventional chocolate processing and less expensive amorphous sugars can replace crystalline sucrose, for example, while still retaining the melting properties and mouthfeel properties known to chocolate and milk chocolate compositions. Several techniques can be used to measure the glass transition and any available or appropriate technique can be used, including differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA).

The present invention also relates to specific chocolate compositions wherein amorphous sugar either wholly or partially replaces crystalline or crystallized sugar as an ingredient. The invention further relates to chocolate compositions wherein amorphous sugar is combined with milk solids, cocoa solids or fruit purees or fruit extracts and dried to a glass transition temperature (Tg) of greater than room temperature, or about 20° C., or about 25° C., or higher. The invention also relates to methods of producing chocolate compositions using amorphous sugar.

In one embodiment, the invention relates to a mixture or composition comprising about 45% by weight sugar, 45% by weight cocoa powder, and 10% by weight water as a composition having an amorphous solid that can be used in producing a chocolate or confectionery product or ingredient. The sugar component of the mixture or composition can consist entirely of amorphous sugar or a combination of amorphous sugar and crystalline sugar. In this and other embodiments or in mixing sugar to create a chocolate, the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar in the sugar ingredient can vary, for example from about 5:95, or about 10:90, or about 20:80, or about 30:70, or about 40:60, or about 50:50, or about 60:40, or about 70:30, or about 80:20, or about 90:10, or about 95:5, or 100:0, or any ratio in between these. In addition, the invention relates in general to sweetener compositions to be used in confectionery or food products comprising amorphous sugar and crystalline sugar wherein the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar is such that the combination has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature, or about 21° C., or about 25° C., or higher. For chocolate compositions in particular, any type of chocolate and chocolate under any desired standard of identity can be selected, such as milk chocolate, white chocolate, bittersweet chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, and others.

Thus, the invention comprises a confectionery or food composition or ingredient comprising cocoa powder or cocoa liquor, a fat or cocoa butter equivalent, and up to about 50% sugar, wherein the crystalline sugar present is at least partially replaced by an amorphous sugar and the ratio of amorphous sugar to crystalline sugar present in the composition results in a glass transition temperature (Tg) of the composition or ingredient of about room temperature, or about 21° C. or higher. As shown in the Figures, an amorphous microstructure can be detectable in the composition or ingredient, by for example microscopy, and can be identified by contrast with a crystalline material under microscopy. A preferred amorphous sugar comprises a corn syrup solid and in particular corn syrup solid DE 42. However, the amorphous sugar can comprises one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90, and DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin. Any of the chocolate compositions or ingredients of the invention can further comprise an emulsifier, such as a lecithin, and/or polyglycerol polyricinoleates (PGPR). Also, especially for milk chocolate compositions, coatings and ingredients, any composition of the invention can comprise a milk powder or one or more milk solids. In any embodiment where chocolate is employed, a cocoa product, powder or liquor can comprises an enhanced level of polyphenols or antioxidants, as known in the art.

In general, the compositions of the invention wherein the amorphous sugar is present can comprise amorphous sugar produced from a fruit puree, or additionally comprise a fruit puree or fruit extract. Any fruit or berry can be selected for such use. As shown in the Examples below, the fruit puree composition can be dried to a desired moisture level and then optionally ground into a pulverized powder before being used as an ingredient in a food or confectionery product or composition. In addition, any ingredient or composition of the invention can comprise or additionally comprise one or more carbohydrate sweeteners, nutritive sweeteners, or non-nutritive sweeteners.

In another general aspect, the invention comprises a method of producing a chocolate or milk chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar comprising: (a) combining water, one or more of chocolate, cocoa powder or cocoa liquor, optionally one of more of a milk powder or non-fat milk powder, and a sweetener composition comprising crystalline sugar and an amorphous sugar; and (b) heating until the water evaporates to a desired level of viscosity or to about 50 C or higher, wherein the sweetener composition contains or comprises at least sugar composition in a particular ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar, and wherein the water content and/or sugar:amorphous sugar content results in a product having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about of about 21° C. or higher. In these compositions, the amorphous sugar can be detectable through microscopy, for example. The method can further comprise mixing in a cocoa butter or a composition comprising a cocoa butter or a vegetable fat or a cocoa butter equivalent. In a preferred embodiment, the composition or method employs a sweetener composition having a crystalline sugar to corn syrup solids DE 42 ratio of about 50:50. The method or composition can further comprise adding or having a fruit puree or an extract from a fruit puree. As noted before, the method of the invention can use one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90 to DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin.

In another general aspect, the invention comprises a method of producing a chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar comprising: (a) selecting a sugar composition having a particular ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar wherein the ratio results in a composition having a glass transition temperature (Tg) of at least room temperature or at least about 20° C. or at least about 21° C. or least about 25° C.; (b) incorporating the sugar composition having a combination of crystalline sugar and amorphous sugar into a cocoa product and a fat and optionally an emulsifier to produce a chocolate composition. The method can further comprise adding one of more of milk powder, non-fat milk powder, or a milk product to produce a milk chocolate composition. The method can use a fat and particularly cocoa butter, vegetable fats, or cocoa butter equivalents, or combinations of them. The ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar in the final product can be about 50:50 and the amorphous sugar can contain one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90 to DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin.

The invention further relates to methods of producing a chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar comprising combining cocoa powder, cocoa liquor, or cocoa product with 1 part non-fat dry milk and 1 part amorphous sugar with 4 parts water, boiling the mixture until the water evaporates, and drying the mixture to 10% moisture to create a powder. The resulting powder is then combined with sugar and cocoa butter at 40° C. The resulting composition contains 20% powder, 45% sugar and 35% cocoa butter.

In another general aspect of the confectionery or food compositions of the invention, the composition, which can be an ingredient or a final food product, comprises a cocoa product, such as cocoa powder, cocoa liquor, or mixture of cocoa products; an appropriate fat or mixture of fats, such as cocoa butter or cocoa butter equivalents; and an amorphous solid or composition. The amorphous solid or composition is generally present in the final composition and detectable as an amorphous structure, as shown in the Figures. The amorphous solid or composition can be made of a variety of edible or food ingredients or compounds. An amorphous solid or composition can also be contrasted with the typical crystalline products used in confectionery manufacture, such as crystalline sugars. By replacing or substituting crystalline sugars, for example, during at least one point in the manufacturing process, the invention also allows the addition or retention of moisture in the food product or ingredient, which reduces costs and allows greater flexibility in final product or ingredient properties. The amorphous solid or composition and/or the confectionery composition is generally produced to have a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about room temperature or higher, or about 20° C. or higher, or about 25° C. or higher.

In any embodiment of the invention, the food composition or ingredient can also contain one or more crystalline sugar, preferably sucrose. In a preferred embodiment, the amorphous solid or composition consists essentially of a corn syrup solid, meaning one of more corn syrup solids is used together with food or edible ingredients that do not change the basic characteristics of the amorphous solid or composition and does not, or substantially does not, change the amorphous solid into a crystalline solid. It is known that certain compositions can be converted from an amorphous state to a crystalline state during a food manufacturing process. In one aspect of the invention, this conversion is substantially avoided or prevented in order to use an amorphous solid or composition. In another aspect, an amorphous solid or composition is an edible ingredient wherein a detectable amorphous structure is found, as shown in the Figures. In yet another aspect, an amorphous solid or composition additionally or alternatively has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of about 20° C. or higher. The examples show a non-limiting group of specific amorphous solids and compositions using corn syrup solids or fruit purees. Many other methods and ingredients can be used to prepare an edible, amorphous solid for use in this invention. Also, and as shown in the examples, the amorphous solid or composition and/or the final food or confectionary product or composition of the invention can comprise one or more sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners, and blends of sweeteners that are known in the art or available for use. The sweeteners can include polydextrose, inulin, polyols, sorbitol, maltodextrin, and sucralose, for example.

In a general aspect, an amorphous solid or composition as used in the invention can contain or consist essentially of a corn syrup solid, such as one or more of corn syrup solids DE 20, DE 28, DE 36, DE 42, DE 43, DE 90, and DE 95, maltose corn syrup DE 65, polydextrose, and inulin. It can also contain other edible or food ingredients or compounds, as shown in the Figures and described in the Examples. The preferred amorphous solid or composition consists essentially of corn syrup solid DE 42, such that the basic amorphous characteristics of the corn syrup are retained through processing. As in other chocolate or food products, the compositions of the invention can contain emulsifiers, lecithin or PGPR, or a combination of emulsifiers, as well as milk, water, concentrated milk, evaporated milk, sweetened condensed milk, dried milk, skim milk, concentrated skim milk, evaporated skim milk, sweetened condensed skim milk, whey protein, non fat milk protein, whole milk powder milk solid or milk powder. Furthermore, the compositions of the invention can contain cocoa butter, a composition comprising cocoa butter, a vegetable fat, a cocoa butter equivalent, or a composition comprising one or more of fractionated and/or hydrogenated and/or interesterified palm kernel oil, palm oil, coconut oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, and corn oil. The amorphous solid or composition can also contain cocoa solids and/or fruit puree.

A preferred embodiment is a composition that forms a milk chocolate coating, enrobing, or filler ingredient in a confectionery product. As is known in the art, specific cocoa containing products or ingredients can be used, such as those where level of polyphenols or antioxidants are enhanced, preserved, or enriched during processing as compared to conventional cocoa.

As shown in the Examples in particular, the invention also encompasses a process where a mixture containing an amorphous solid is produced and then added to other confectionery ingredients or chocolate ingredients before refining, conching, or molding. The process or method can also include heating, evaporation, vacuum treatment, or other method of removing or reducing moisture content. As in other aspects, removing moisture from the food composition or ingredient can be used to reach a desired viscosity.

In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of producing a chocolate composition containing amorphous sugar, the method comprising selecting a ratio of crystalline sugar to amorphous sugar to be used during production such that the final composition has a glass transition temperature of at least room temperature and incorporating the crystalline sugar and amorphous sugar into chocolate. As noted, the ratio selected can vary and can even be up to 100% amorphous sugar or a combination of more than one amorphous sugar.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

The present application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/039140, filed Apr. 1, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to oral compositions comprising carbonate compounds that inhibit dental plaque and caries-associatedA. naeslundiigrowth and biofilm formation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Caries and periodontal diseases are two of the most common chronic infectious diseases affecting humankind and are always associated with dental plaque formed as a biofilm on tooth surfaces. Dental plaque is produced by sequential attachment of a variety of bacteria, which is dependent on both the species involved and the surface composition.Actinomyces naeslundii(A. naeslundii) are Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria that are among the first species to occupy the oral cavity and colonize the tooth's surface.A. naeslundiihave been implicated in periodontal disease and root caries.

Quorum sensing is a means of intercellular communication between bacterial cells that allows bacteria to control gene expression and respond to population density as a group. Bacteria occupying the oral cavity, includingA. naeslundii, use quorum-sensing systems to regulate several physiological processes, including the incorporation of foreign DNA, acid tolerance, biofilm formation, and virulence. Thus, through quorum sensing,A. naeslundiican optimize their physiology to adapt to environmental stimuli and can behave as a collective, thereby resulting in better colonization of hosts, evolution as a species, and improved responses to mechanical, physical, and chemical stresses. Consequently, bacteria in biofilms have an increased resistance to antimicrobials and host defenses.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention includes oral care compositions and methods for inhibiting growth and formation of oral biofilms by quorum sensing inhibition and/or bactericidal activity.

In some embodiments, the present invention discloses an oral care composition including a therapeutically effective amount of at least one carbonate compound of Formula 1 and at least one excipient:

wherein,R1and R2are independently: an aliphatic radical; a hydroxyaliphatic radical; or an aryl radical.

In some embodiments, R1is chosen from a cyclic or branched aliphatic radical having up to 10 carbon atoms and R2is chosen from a linear or branched hydroxyaliphatic radical. In some embodiments, R1is an unsubstituted aryl radical and R2is chosen from a linear or branched hydroxyaliphatic radical having up to 10 carbon atoms.

In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method of providing oral care benefits including applying to an oral cavity an oral care composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one carbonate compound of Formula 1 and at least one excipient. In some embodiments, the oral care benefits include biofilm anti-attachment, anti-oxidant, and anti-microbial benefits.

In some embodiments, the present invention discloses a method of up-regulating or down-regulating periodontal disease metabolites including applying to an oral cavity an oral care composition containing a therapeutically effective amount of at least one carbonate compound of Formula 1 and at least one excipient. In some embodiments, the oral care composition up-regulates or down-regulates at least one member chosen from: a compound generated by amino acid metabolism; a compound generated in the urea cycle; a compound generated in glutathion conversion; a compound generated in lipid metabolism; a compound generated in carbohydrate metabolism; a compound generated by nucleic acid metabolism; vitamins; and co-factors.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to surfactant-based all-purpose liquid cleaning compositions designed in particular for cleaning household hard surfaces as well as glass surfaces, which are effective in removing soils such as grease soil while also leaving un-rinsed or unwiped surfaces residue free.

In recent years liquid detergents have become widely accepted for cleaning hard surfaces, for example, painted woodwork and panels, tiled walls, wash bowls, bathtubs and other bathroom fixtures, linoleum or tile floors, or washable wall paper. Such “all-purpose” liquids may include clear and opaque aqueous mixtures of water-soluble synthetic organic detergents and water-soluble detergent builder salts. In order to achieve comparable cleaning efficiency with granular or powdered all-purpose cleaning compositions, use of water-soluble inorganic phosphate builder salts has generally been favored in currently known all-purpose liquids.

However, such currently known all-purpose liquid detergents containing detergent builder salts or other equivalents tend to leave films, spots or streaks on cleaned un-rinsed surfaces, particularly shiny surfaces. Thus, such liquids require thorough rinsing of the cleaned surfaces, which is a time-consuming chore for the user.

Consequently, there remains a need for all-purpose liquid cleaning compositions designed in particular for cleaning household hard surfaces as well as glass surfaces, which are both versatile and effective in removing soils such as grease soil, and also in leaving un-rinsed surfaces residue free, ideally with a shiny appearance.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The antibacterial effects of zinc ions in the oral cavity are described in the art and numerous attempts have been made to prepare dentifrice compositions incorporating zinc ions to take advantage of the therapeutic benefits of reduced plaque, gum inflammation and/or gingivitis. However, such formulations are noted for their unpleasant taste, often referred to as “astringent”. Such unpleasant organoleptic experiences often result in reduced compliance to an oral care regimen by the patient/consumer.

Various attempts to disguise or avoid the unpleasant organoleptic aspects while retailing and/or enhancing the therapeutic benefits obtained have been made. However, there remains a need in the art for a dentifrice formulation that allows the patient/consumer to obtain the therapeutic benefits of a zinc-containing dentifrice, whilst not suffering the disadvantageous organoleptic experience associated with such dentifrices.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention includes a dentifrice composition that comprises a zinc ion source, a polyphosphate ion source, an anethole, and a silica. The silica has a mean particle size of about 5 to about 12 microns, an Einlehner hardness of about 1 to about 20, and an oil absorption of about 40 to less than about 100 cc/100 g. The composition contains zinc ions and polyphosphate ions in a weight ratio of about 0.1:1 to about 10:1 and has a RDA value of about 100 to about 200 and a PCR value of about 75 to about 110. In one embodiment, the zinc ion source is zinc citrate.

The invention also includes related methods, such as a method of maintaining and/or enhancing systemic health that includes topically applying the dentifrice composition of the invention at least once a day to an oral surface, or a method of reducing the presence of plaque on an oral surface comprising topically applying an oral care composition at least once a day to an oral surface.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser and a medicament for engaging tissue of the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, they have generally not been effective, easy to use, or socially acceptable for use in a public setting. Further, many of these scrapers cannot easily be used to cleanse other tissue within the mouth. Notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by cleaning the tissue in the mouth, many users avoid the use of such cleansers due to a lack of comfort and/or ease of use.

In addition, it has not been convenient or socially acceptable for users to clean their tongues and other soft tissue in the mouth in public settings, on the go or, away from home.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris, maintains comfort to the user, provides a substance to treat tissues of the mouth, is easy to use, and is socially acceptable and convenient in public settings or on the go. There is also a need for an oral implement which combines the cleaning effects of a tissue cleanser and medicament.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement includes a tissue cleanser which provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect of the invention, a releasable material is supported by an insoluble tissue cleanser that includes at least one tissue engaging element for cleaning tissue surfaces in the mouth. The tissue engaging element(s) may be rubbed along the oral tissue to remove bacteria and debris while a chemical of the releasable material is released into the mouth of a user. In one preferred embodiment, the releasable material is provided as an antiseptic and/or breath freshener for enhanced cleaning and freshening of the mouth.

In another aspect of the invention, the tissue cleanser is composed of an elastomeric material. In one preferred embodiment, the tissue cleanser is formed as an elastomeric molded element provided with a plurality of exterior nubs. The tissue cleanser may include an interior or an exterior supporting surface of an oral medicament.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement includes a cavity to hold an oral medicament for ease of releasing the medicament into the mouth.

In another aspect of the invention, the oral care implement resembles a lollipop for convenience, ease of use and social acceptance. In one preferred embodiment, the tongue cleanser and/or medicament has a disk shape and is mounted on the end of a stick.

In another aspect of the invention, a chemical is incorporated into the material of a tissue cleanser. In one preferred embodiment, the chemical is released from the tissue cleanser for creating a sensory response to the tissues inside of the mouth of a user.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present application relates generally to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, soft tissue cleaners and combined tooth cleaning/soft tissue cleaning devices, and, more particularly, to an oral care implement having a dispenser, such as a store of releasable dentifrice, and a film matrix containing a rapidly releasable agent.

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that can be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale. Further, these types of toothbrushes attempt to provide basic teeth cleaning without effectively engaging soft oral tissues or providing effective tongue cleaning.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The various features described herein can help improve dental care by providing enhanced dispensing of a dentifrice along with superior cleaning of teeth and/or soft oral tissues.

In one embodiment, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head having a first face and a second face; tooth cleaning elements extending from the first face of the head and soft tissue cleaning elements extending from the second face of the head; a store of dentifrice retained at the head; a film matrix containing at least one rapidly releasable agent, the film matrix comprising a plurality of discrete film matrix particles; and wherein the film matrix particles are attached to the soft tissue cleaning elements.

In another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head having a first face and a second face, a recess formed into the head at the second face; tooth cleaning elements extending from the first face of the head and soft tissue cleaning elements extending from the second face of the head; a store of dentifrice retained at the head; and a film matrix containing at least one rapidly releasable agent, wherein the film matrix comprises a film strip disposed within the recess.

In yet another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head; an arrangement of tooth cleaning elements on a first surface of the head; a first path providing a first flow of dentifrice from a store of dentifrice retained at the head to the tooth cleaning elements; an arrangement of soft tissue cleaning elements on a second surface of the head; a film matrix containing at least one rapidly releasable agent disposed within a recess formed into the second surface of the head, the at least one rapidly releasable agent flowing to the soft tissue cleaning elements during use of the oral care implement; and wherein upon depletion of the film matrix from the recess, the recess forms a second path providing a second flow of dentifrice from the store of dentifrice to the soft tissue cleaning elements.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with a liquid collection system. Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects. Dental checkups to a dentist office are typically the only feedback a person receives on their dental cleaning efforts. There is unfortunately plenty of time in between checkups for poor dental habits to cause problems. For example, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and a host of other problems can be magnified if dental cleaning habits are not rectified promptly.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a collection system of oral fluids.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having an oral member having a thickness that is reduced or shortened during use; a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; a receiver fluidly coupled to the oral member for receiving an oral fluid; and a fluid pathway in communication with the receiver to provide the oral fluid to the reservoir. In one possible embodiment, the oral member may be made of a conventional hydrogel material that may swell during use.

In another aspect, an oral care implement includes a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; and a multilayer collection member including a layer that wears away during use so as to expose an indicium layer that indicates when the reservoir should be provided for analysis of the collected oral fluid.

In yet another aspect, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir for storing an oral fluid. A capillary channel constructed from a fibrous material, ceramic, porous plastic, or combination thereof extends through at least a portion of the implement to receive the oral fluid from one or more inlets.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an oral care instrument with at least one oral care agent that can be delivered within, the mouth of a user to provide the user with enhanced oral heath. The present invention also pertains to such an oral care instrument including a wear indicator that informs the user when the oral care agent has been depleted.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

People exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. As a result, decreasing the amount of harmful bacteria in the mouth has long been the target of persons working in the oral health care field.

The most common way of minimizing the harmful bacteria within the mouth is brushing with a dentifrice that delivers at least one oral care agent into the mouth. Orally introduced liquids, including oral rinses, are also utilized to provide additional oral care beyond that achieved while brushing. Mouthwashes may also be used to deliver breath freshening agents within the mouth in an attempt to eliminate bad breath.

Unfortunately, people do not always have the time to provide themselves with adequate oral care. For example, a busy person may not have the time or patience to brush thoroughly, floss and/or use an oral rinse. Alternatively, certain people may consider anything more than brushing their teeth to be unnecessary. For either reason, these people may leave a significant amount of harmful bacteria within their mouths after completing their oral care routines, which can begin to attack the teeth and gums.

Additionally, even when all available and recommended products are used, they may not be as effective as they could be if delivered simultaneously. For example, using a dentifrice and an oral rinse at different times may diminish any synergistic effect that they could provide to the user when used simultaneously.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An aspect of the present invention pertains to an oral care instrument that includes and delivers an oral care agent within the mouth of a user. The oral care instrument includes a head having at least a portion formed of a material that defines cavities. At least one oral care agent is provided in a plurality of the cavities and dispensed within the mouth of a user when the oral care agent(s) contact a fluid or chemical within the oral cavity. In another aspect of the present invention, the oral care instrument includes a wear indicator for indicating the amount of oral care agent.

Another aspect of the present invention relates to an oral care device formed of a polymer that receives at least one oral care agent. The oral care agent(s) can be included in or on one or more surfaces of the oral care instrument for delivery into the oral cavity. The oral care agent(s) can be contained, within cavities in one or more surfaces of a head. Alternatively, the oral care agent(s) can be formed into, or carried by, a thin slab subsequently bonded onto the toothbrush head; or applied onto the toothbrush head as a stable coating. The oral care agents can be released during one use, during multiple uses, or throughout the life of the instrument. Water, oral secretions and/or chemicals within the mouth can activate the oral care agents.

"BACKGROUND

There are many ways to deliver a material to a person. For some materials, the delivery may be more difficult because the material may volatilize away once delivered to a person, or the material may adversely interact with other ingredients in a composition to reduce the level of the material. Also, it would be desirable to deliver a material to a person and have the material available when needed.

For personal care products, fragrance is used to provide a pleasant aroma to the product and the person. Fragrance longevity is desired to continue delivering the fragrance after the product has been applied. While fragrances can be encapsulated in various materials, there usually needs to be some mechanical action that breaks down the encapsulate to release the material. When the personal care product is an antiperspirant/deodorant, it would be desirable to release fragrance when needed during sweating.

SUMMARY

A method of delivering a material to a person comprising applying an anhydrous composition to a person, whereina) the anhydrous composition comprises a base and metal organic framework formed from a recyclable porous material (RPM) with the material adsorbed into the metal organic framework, andb) the recyclable porous material has a structure that breaks down when contacted with water to release the material.

"BACKGROUND

Periodontitis is characterized, in part, by abnormal and excessive degradation of the periodontal organic matrix. This matrix includes the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. At least a portion of the destruction of the matrix is mediated by the overproduction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases. MMPs also facilitate bone resorption by degrading the osteoid (i.e., the non-mineralized and newly-synthesized bone matrix), then degrading the matrix. These events result in the clinical manifestation of periodontitis, including gingival recession, pocket formation, loss of attachment, and eventual tooth loss.

SUMMARY

The invention includes a method for treating periodontitis in a mammal in need thereof comprising contacting a cell in the mouth of the mammal with an agent that down-regulates at least one matrix metalloproteinase selected from the group consisting of MMP-9 and MMP-13, wherein the down-regulation of the metalloproteinase correlates with a reduction in at least one symptom associated with periodontitis.

The invention also includes a method of identifying a compound useful in treating periodontitis in a mammal, the method comprising contacting a cell with a test compound and determining whether the test compound down-regulates at least one matrix metalloproteinase selected from the group consisting of MMP-9 and MMP-13, wherein the down-regulation of at least one of the matrix metalloproteinases is an indication that the test compound is useful to treat periodontitis.

The invention also includes a method of treating periodontitis in a mammal in need thereof comprising administering to the oral cavity of the mammal an oral composition comprising 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether in an amount which is effective to down-regulate at least one matrix metalloproteinase in the oral cavity of the mammal, the matrix metalloproteinase being selected from the group consisting of MMP-9 and MMP-13, wherein the down-regulation of the matrix metalloproteinase results in the treatment of periodontitis in the mammal.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Sensory signals play an important role in communicating key benefits to the consumer. For example, when using toothpaste there is typically no immediate signal that the product has worked as promised or clone anything during use. A visual cue, such as the foam changing color from white to blue could dramatically improve this perception but the art reports that such technologies may not be currently feasible.

Moreover, a need exists to control the rate at which this color change occurs so that the signal could be used to ensure consumer compliance (e.g., to ensure a child has brushed adequately).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention includes a composition that includes a film. The film is composed of a first shielding polymer layer, a middle decorative layer, and a second shielding polymer layer. The first and the second shielding layers obscure at least a portion of the middle decorative layer.

Also included are methods of using the compositions in an oral care, personal care, or home care regimen.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a package in general, and more particularly to a powered toothbrush package that visually demonstrates the functionality of a toothbrush. Consumers generally use various sensing capabilities including sight, sound and touch in making a determination as to the desirability of a product. However, at a point of purchase such as a retail location, products ma not be completely accessible to a consumer because the products may be housed, contained or otherwise wrapped in packaging to protect against loss or damage.

Furthermore, it is often difficult for consumers to understand and correlate how movement of a powered toothbrush head results in cleaning teeth. Hence, there is a need for product packaging and methods for demonstrating the functionality of a powered toothbrush to a consumer in an easily perceivable fashion.

BRIEF SUMMARY THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a package for a powered product. In one aspect, a powered toothbrush package visually demonstrates the functionality of a toothbrush.

According to one aspect of the invention, a package for an oral care implement has a base member having indicia associated therewith. The indicia are structured such that in response to a vibratory input adapted to be provided by the implement, a visual effect is produced from the indicia. In one construction, the indicia include a first element containing a marking and a second element containing a marking. Relative movement is provided between the elements that cause the markings to provide a visual effect to a viewer. In one exemplary construction, the relative movement is provided in response to a vibratory input provided by the oral care implement.

Another aspect of the invention is directed to an oral care implement vibration demonstration assembly that includes a powered oral care implement, a package housing, and a plurality of vibration demonstration elements as described herein. The oral care implement demonstration assembly may be configured to produce a visual demonstration effect when a first vibration demonstration element is moved relative to a second vibration demonstration element. A Moiré effect is among the visual effects that may be provided by the demonstration assembly.

Another aspect of the invention is directed to an oral care implement demonstration assembly that includes a powered toothbrush having a user input, a product package, a visual demonstration insert that has visual elements and a visual demonstration reference element. Further, a portion of the visual demonstration insert may visually overlay a portion of the visual demonstration reference element as movement of one relative to the other causes a visual effect.

A further aspect of the invention is directed to a method for demonstrating vibration of an oral care implement. A package is provided that contains a powered oral care implement having a user input. A first demonstration element and a second demonstration element are operably associated with the package and the implement.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A number of disease conditions are associated with the action of bacteria in the oral cavity. For example, gingivitis, an inflammation or infection of the gums and alveolar bones, is generally believed to be caused by plaque causing bacterial and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. In addition, plaque provides a locus for calculus or tartar formation. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar), which affects the periodontal ligaments. As plaque and tartar continue to build up, the gums begin to recede, which can lead to continued inflammation, infection and potentially the loss of teeth.

To prevent or treat these diseased conditions, antibacterial agents may be incorporated into oral care compositions such as toothpaste and mouthwashes or rinses. Application of antibacterial compositions in the oral cavity tends to retard plaque formation and related oral infections. It is also common to provide oral compositions containing components that remove or prevent the build-up of tartar. Effective antitartar agents, such as phosphates, are believed to work in-part by interfering with crystalline growth of hydroxyapatite on the tooth surface.

The antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds in a dentifrice composition depends on a number of factors, including the presence of other ingredients that may interfere with its action. For example, certain cationic antibacterial compounds and certain nonionic antibacterial compounds lose their effectiveness when formulated with certain anionic surfactants or other anionic active ingredients, such as tartar control phosphates. In many instances, it is preferred to use antibacterial compounds that do not show the adverse interactions with such anionic components.

Extracts fromMagnolia officinalis(hereinafter “magnolia”), and especially from the bark, contain biphenol antibacterial compounds. The extracts have been found to have antibacterial effectiveness when formulated into, for example, toothpaste formulations.

Extracts prepared from natural sources such as magnolia are variable in composition and may contain many compounds other than the particular actives for which the extract is prepared. In addition, the composition of the extracts can vary from season to season and between different geographical regions. For these many reasons, it may be desirable to synthesize naturally occurring products such as those found in magnolia extracts.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is based in part on the discovery that a particular analog of magnolol 5,5′-dibutyl-2,2′-dihydroxy-1,1′-biphenyl—is effective as an antiplaque and antibacterial component of dentifrices and other oral compositions. The invention relates to various oral compositions containing the compound and an orally acceptable carrier. In various embodiments, antibacterial and antiplaque oral compositions are provided in the form of a paste or gel, a powder, a mouthwash or mouth rinse, a lozenge, chewing gum, an edible strip, and the like. The antibacterial compound is synthesized by Friedel-Crafts type acylation of a biphenol compound, followed by reduction to the end product.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/029472, filed on Mar. 31, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

The present invention relates to an oral care composition, for example a dentifrice composition, for enhanced delivery of an antiplaque/anticalculus agent to the oral surfaces in the oral cavity, and which may additionally treat or prevent hypersensitivity of the teeth. The present invention also relates to a method of delivering an antiplaque/anticalculus agent to the oral surfaces in the oral cavity and simultaneously treating or preventing hypersensitivity of the teeth. The present invention has particular application in treating or preventing hypersensitivity of the teeth by occluding dentin tubules.

BACKGROUND

Dentin is a portion of the tooth internal to the enamel and cementum that has a radially striated appearance owing to a large number of fine canals or tubules known as the dentinal tubules. Tubules run from the pulp cavity to the periphery of the dentin and are generally about two microns in diameter at their base and somewhat narrower at their periphery. Tubules are not usually exposed to the environment in the oral cavity, as they are usually covered by enamel or cementum. The cementum in turn is often covered by the gums.

It is commonly understood that partially or fully exposed tubules can lead to tooth sensitivity, an irritating and painful condition. In this theory, recession of the gum line exposes cementum to erosion. The eroded cementum in turn exposes the hollow dentinal tubules. The exposed tubules cause nerves within the tooth to be affected excessively by external oral stimuli because material and energy transfer between the exterior and interior of the tooth is accelerated through the tubules. Common environmental stimuli, such as heat, cold, chemicals and physical and mechanical pressure or stimuli, such as brushing, are able to irritate the nerve through the open dentin tubules and thereby create pain. The pain of sensitive teeth appears to result from these stimuli, which apparently cause fluid movements in the dentinal tubules that activate pulpal nerve endings.

Conventionally, two approaches have been taken to treat or ameliorate tooth sensitivity. Under one approach, the chemical environment proximal to the nerve is altered by application of various agents, such that the nerve is not stimulated, or not stimulated as greatly. Known agents useful in this chemical approach, including potassium salts (such as potassium nitrate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium chloride) and strontium, zinc salts, and chloride salts.

The second approach involves the mechanical shield of the nerve by, e.g., blocking of the dentinal tubules wholly or partially with “tubule blocking agents.” Agents that have been disclosed in the prior art include, e.g., cationic alumina, clays, water-soluble or water-swellable polyelectrolytes, oxalates, amorphous calcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite, maleic acid copolymers and polyethylene particles.

US-A1-2009/0186090 in the name of the present Applicant discloses the provision of an oral care composition that reduces and/or eliminates the perception of tooth sensitivity. The composition includes an adherent material and includes, in part, silica particles having a particle size of 2-5 microns.

However, even though such an oral care composition provides clinical hypersensitivity relief, there is nevertheless still a need in the art for an oral care composition, in particular a dentifrice, that, upon use, provides enhanced prevention or reduction of tooth sensitivity and is not associated with significant processing or formulation disadvantages.

It is also known is the art to use zinc oxide as an antiplaque/anticalculus agent. It is also known to use complexes of divalent or trivalent metal ions as antiplaque agents.

It has been demonstrated in the literature that the solubility of zinc can be improved by forming a complex with a chelating molecule such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid or a bioactive molecule such as a cyclic α-hydroxyketone. For example, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,287,541, specific cyclic alpha-hydroxyketones are used as complexing agents for divalent copper, zinc, iron or tin and trivalent iron S. Y. Gan, et al. “Antibacterial Activity of Zn-chelator Complexes.” IADR, March 2009 discloses the use of inert biocompatible chelators for zinc.

However, increased solubility does not guarantee an increase in anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis, hypersensitivity, and/or fresh breath efficacy. To provide these benefits the zinc must be delivered to the hard and/or soft tissues in the oral cavity.

There is still a need for enhanced delivery of antiplaque/anticalculus agents to the oral surfaces, in particular hard and/or soft tissue in the oral cavity.

Optionally, the at least one amino acid is present in an amount of up to 5% by weight, further optionally from 0.5 to 5% by weight, still further optionally from 2.5 to 4.5% by weight, based on the total weight of the oral care composition.

The oral care composition may further comprise a polymeric adherent material for adhering the metal oxide particles in the dentin tubule.

In some embodiments, the metal oxide is encapsulated in a polymeric adherent material.

In some embodiments, the polymeric adherent material comprises at least one cellulose polymer.

The at least one cellulose polymer may be one or more hydroxyalkyl cellulose polymer selected from hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), hydroxyethylpropyl cellulose (HEPC), hydroxybutylmethyl cellulose (HBMC), and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC).

The composition and methods within the scope of the invention may be useful in, for example, reducing or eliminating tooth sensitivity of a mammal, improving/maintaining systemic health, and/or occluding dentin tubules.

The present invention is predicated on the finding by the present inventors that charged amino acids and peptides have an affinity for the soft and/or hard tissue in the oral cavity and are also capable of chelating a metal oxide, such as zinc oxide, stannous oxide, or copper oxide, which has antiplaque/anticalculus efficacy when present in a therapeutically effective amount. Upon introduction of such a complex into the oral cavity, for example by brushing of the teeth, the amino acid/peptide can act to deliver the metal oxide to the desired location in the mouth. For example, if zinc oxide is delivered to dentin, the zinc oxide amino acid complex can occlude dentin tubules and provide hypersensitivity relief. Yet further the metal oxide can provide antiplaque/anticalculus treatment or prevention.

The present inventors have found in particular that the delivery of zinc oxide from dentifrice to a hydroxyapatite surface can be increased with the addition of an amino acid such as L-arginine. The form of the zinc oxide in the dentifrice can include, but is not limited to, powder, nanoparticle solution, and encapsulation of the zinc oxide by a polymer film or bead.

"BACKGROUND

Antiperspirant or deodorant formulations have been developed with a range of different product forms. One of these is a so-called “stick” which is usually a bar of an apparently firm solid material held within a dispensing container and which retains its structural integrity and shape whilst being applied. When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface, a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface. Payout, of a deodorant stick, describes the weight lost to a surface from a typical application of the deodorant stick. This attribute and other rheological properties are considerations when developing new stick deodorant products. Therefore, a controlled method and device for measuring such properties is desirable.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring one or more of static friction and kinetic friction is provided. The method comprises: positioning a substrate of pre-known weight on an XYZ translational substrate bed; supporting a sample in a sample holder, wherein the sample is perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed; placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder so that the sample and substrate form a contact point; first moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a first sweep speed in a first direction relative to the sample; second moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a second sweep speed in a second direction relative to the sample; conducting the first moving and the second moving for a predetermined number of cycle(s); during the first moving step and the second moving step, measuring one or more friction values at the contact point; analyzing one or more friction values generated at the sample contact point during the first moving step and the second moving step; and determining one or more of a static friction value and a kinetic friction value based on the one or more friction values.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring flakeoff is provided. The method comprises: providing a wool sample of a predetermined size; applying an initial weight of a material to the wool sample; attaching a first end of the wool to a stationary holder and a second end to a movable substrate bed; a stretching step comprising moving the movable substrate bed a predetermined distance and returning and then moving it to an opposite direction for the same predetermined distance and returning for 1 stretch; repeating the stretch step for a predetermined number of stretches; measuring the weight of the wool sample and material after the predetermined number of stretches; determining a weight loss of material from the wool sample as measured by an amount of material lost from the sample divided by the initial weight of material after the predetermined number of stretches.

In each of the above methods, the methods are conducted on the above described system.

"BACKGROUND

There have been several forms of antiperspirant products, such as sticks, soft solids, roll-ons, and aerosols. The antiperspirant products may additionally contain deodorant actives. The different forms deliver antiperspirant actives, and optionally deodorant actives, to axillary areas. There can be disadvantages when formulating these types of products.

One disadvantage is that when an antiperspirant active is included, steps need to be taken to stabilize the antiperspirant from hydrolyzing and polymerizing during storage. When an antiperspirant polymerizes into larger species, the efficacy is reduced.

Another disadvantage is that materials used for delivery, such as in the sticks or soft solids, can leave a white residue on the skin. This can be aesthetically unpleasing when seen on skin or when transferred to clothing during wearing.

It would be advantageous to develop a new form of delivery of antiperspirant and/or deodorant actives.

This application is directed to the manufacture of cocoa-based products and more particularly to the manufacture of nuggets having high levels of cocoa loading.

BACKGROUND

The health benefits of high antioxidant foods have become increasingly appreciated by greater segments of the population. Scientific studies suggest that certain plant compounds that act as antioxidants in foods may reduce the risk of many kinds of illness, from heart disease to cancer.

Cocoa comes from cacao beans (or cocoa beans), which grow on the cacao tree. Cocoa beans are full of polyphenolics and other natural plant nutrients. The polyphenolics, also called flavanols, have a high oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). The antioxidants found in cocoa have been linked to certain hallmarks of good cardiovascular health such as enhanced blood flow, healthy cholesterol levels and, in some cases, reduced blood pressure. In fact, two tablespoons of natural cocoa have more antioxidant capacity than three cups of green tea, a half cup of blueberries or a glass of red wine.

However, the high level of polyphenols also contributes to a highly bitter taste. As a result, high loading of cocoa powder in foods to obtain maximum benefits of the antioxidants from the cocoa is generally limited in order to make those foods more palatable. High levels of cocoa powder also generally necessitate changes to product formulation and introduces processing difficulties, causing significant losses in antioxidant levels as a result of the processing.

A method and product are desired to deliver high levels of cocoa antioxidant with minimal undesirable modification of the taste, formulation or process of the food product containing the cocoa.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to concentrated cocoa powder nuggets and methods of making such nuggets that can be used as an ingredient such as an inclusion or a topping for food products in order to increase antioxidant levels. The nugget is manufactured by creating a dough followed by forming the dough into nuggets by methods such as rotary moulding, sheeting and cutting, or cold extrusion. In some cases, the nuggets may then be baked or dried to remove excess moisture and obtain desired texture and shelf life. The nuggets can be crunchy or chewy.

In one embodiment, a method for creating a cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including, on a dry basis, at least 30% by weight cocoa powder, the dough having a moisture content of at least 10% to about 52% by weight; and processing the dough into nuggets having a moisture content of not greater than about 15% by weight.

In another embodiment, a method for creating a chewy cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including on a dry basis, at least 50% by weight non-alkalized cocoa powder, the dough having a moisture content of at least 15% by weight, the dough further including about 20% to 45% by weight of a binding agent; and processing the dough into nuggets having a moisture content in the range of about 10% to about 15% by weight and a water activity not greater than 0.6, wherein the nuggets exhibit a loss of oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) of less than 5% compared to the provided dough.

In yet another embodiment, a method for creating a crunchy cocoa nugget comprises providing a dough including, on a dry basis, at least 50% by weight cocoa powder, and, on a dry basis, less than 20% by weight sweetener, the dough having a moisture content of at least 35% by weight; forming the dough into nuggets; and baking the nuggets to dry to a nugget moisture content of not greater than about 6% by weight, wherein the baked nuggets exhibit a loss of ORAC of less than 5% compared to the provided dough.

Among the advantages of exemplary embodiments is that a cocoa nugget can be formed as an ingredient that has a high retention of cocoa antioxidants during and after processing, can have low or no sugar content, can include other nutrients such as proteins, minerals, and can be controlled to provide shelf stable products of either a crunchy or chewy texture.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments, which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to dispensing caps in general, and in particular to a dispensing cap that enables selective addition of a secondary fluid from one of a number of auxiliary reservoirs.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are many flowable packaged substances or products on the market today offering many choices to consumers for personal care, oral care, and home care products. Such products may include without limitation body washes, liquid soap, body lotions, shampoos, conditioners, household cleaners, etc. Products within the same category are often available in a variety of formulations, colors, and/or fragrances adding to the type and number of products available. However, products are often packaged alone in a single container. Thus, if consumers want to experience more than one product at any time, several individual containers or bottles of products must generally be purchased and stored so that the desired product is available when needed. The purchase of many individual separate containers to obtain the variety of products desired may become a costly proposition and cumbersome to store.

Thus, it would be desirable to provide multiple product options within a single convenient container. For example, it would be desirable to enable a user to select from a variety of different fragrance options that could be mixed with, or added to, a basic liquid product such as a body wash or shampoo. A variety of arrangements have been used in the past to provide mixing of fluids during dispensing. Such prior arrangements often include a single flexible container housing separate fluid compartments separated by a wall, where squeezing the container squeezes the separate components from a common nozzle for mixing at the dispensing site. Other arrangements, such as are commonly used for mixing epoxy cements, involve co-dispensing components from separate chambers using a finger-operated piston. Still other devices divide individual components within a single container using a frangible membrane which can be broken during the dispensing operation so that the components can be mixed within the container and dispensed as one.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A device is disclosed for dispensing a primary flowable substance from a main reservoir of a container, where the user can also select a variety of secondary flowable substances from a plurality of additional reservoirs. The device allows the primary and secondary flowable substances to be mixed and dispensed at the same time. In one embodiment, the disclosed device enables a user to select from a variety of different perfumes into a primary liquid body wash or shampoo.

A multi-chamber cap is disclosed for selectively mixing and dispensing a plurality of flowable substances. The cap may comprise a main piston for receiving a primary flowable substance from a primary reservoir, and a secondary reservoir for storing a secondary flowable substance. The cap may further comprise a booster piston associated with the secondary reservoir to dispense the secondary flowable substance. A mixing chamber may be provided for receiving a quantity of the primary flowable substance and a quantity of secondary flowable substance. Accordingly, actuation of the main piston causes a first quantity of the primary flowable substance to be introduced into the mixing chamber, and simultaneously causes a second quantity of the secondary flowable substance to be introduced into the mixing chamber where the primary and secondary flowable substances are at least partially mixed.

A multi-chamber cap is disclosed for selectively mixing and dispensing different flowable substances. The cap may comprise a main piston for receiving a primary flowable substance from a primary reservoir and a plurality of secondary reservoirs for storing a plurality of secondary flowable substances. A plurality of booster pistons may also be provided, each of the plurality of booster pistons associated with a respective one of the plurality of secondary reservoirs to dispense a secondary flowable substance contained in the associated secondary reservoir. A selector may further be provided for selecting one of the plurality of booster pistons to be actuated simultaneously with actuation of the main piston. Accordingly, movement of the main piston from an unactuated position to an actuated position causes a first quantity of the primary flowable substance to be dispensed and causes a second quantity of the selected secondary flowable substance to be dispensed, wherein the primary and secondary flowable substances are at least partially mixed and simultaneously dispensed from a dispensing end of the cap.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a process for the production of ethanol by fermentation. More specifically, the present invention is directed to a process to improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The production of alcoholic beverages by the fermentation of fruit and grains is of ancient origin. In more recent times, the isolation of ethanol in concentrated or in pure form for use either in beverages, in industry, or as fuel, has assumed considerable importance. In general, ethanol may be produced by the fermentation of simple sugars such as glucose and fructose and oligosaccharides such as sucrose. Such substances and mixtures thereof which, without prior chemical modification, are convertible to ethanol will be referred to herein as “fermentable carbohydrates.” More complex carbohydrates such as starches and cellulosic materials also may be converted to ethanol by fermentation, but usually only after they are degraded to lower molecular weight sugars or related materials. The fermentation proceeds in an anaerobic environment, with production of carbon dioxide by-product. The Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, N.Y., presents a condensed summary of the state of the art of producing and isolating fermentation-ethanol in Volume 9, at pages 352-361, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Ethanol has widespread application as an industrial chemical, gasoline additive or straight liquid fuel. As a fuel or fuel additive, ethanol dramatically reduces air emissions while improving engine performance. As a renewable fuel, ethanol reduces national dependence on finite and largely foreign fossil fuel sources while decreasing the net accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

In contrast to energy production by combustion of fossil fuels, energy production by combustion of contemporary biomass (predominantly in the form of harvested plant material) or fuels derived from such biomass is regarded as being “CO2-neutral”, since the amount of CO2released by combustion of a given amount of such biomass corresponds to the amount of CO2which was originally taken up from the atmosphere during the build-up of that amount of biomass.

Among fuels derived from plant biomass, ethanol has received particular attention as a potential replacement for or supplement to petroleum-derived liquid hydrocarbon products. To minimize the production cost of ethanol produced from biomass (also referred to in the following as “bioethanol”) it is important to use biomass in the form of low-cost by-products from gardening, agriculture, forestry, the timber industry and the like; thus, for example, materials such as straw, maize stems, forestry waste (log slash, bark, small branches, twigs and the like), sawdust and wood-chips are all materials which can be employed to produce bioethanol.

Biomass typically includes materials containing cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, protein and carbohydrates such as starch and sugar. Common forms of biomass include trees, shrubs and grasses, corn and corn husks as well as municipal solid waste, waste paper and yard waste. Biomass high in starch, sugar or protein such as corn, grains, fruits and vegetables are usually consumed as food. Conversely, biomass high in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin are not readily digestible and are primarily utilized for wood and paper products, fuel, or are disposed of.

Biomass contains two basic constituents, carbohydrates and lignin. The carbohydrate content of the biomass contains cellulose and hemicellulose. Both cellulose and hemicellulose can be converted to sugars of glucose and xylose. Fermentation converts glucose and xylose to ethanol using enzymes produced by microorganisms, for example, as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,789,210. Control of nutrients, pH, temperature, sugar concentration, and microorganism concentration all affect rate of fermentation to form ethanol. When ethanol concentration reaches above about 6 to 12%, ethanol concentration can be lethal to the microorganisms employed for fermentation. To reduce ethanol concentration within broth employed for fermentation and maintain activity of microorganisms, extraction of ethanol from the broth by solvents non-toxic to microorganisms, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,110,319, 4,865,973 and No. 4,517,298. The operations disclosed require energy for vaporization of ethanol and subsequent condensation to produce liquid ethanol.

The various operations in processes for obtaining ethanol from such recurring sources as cellulose, cane sugar, amylaceous gains and tubers, e.g., the separation of starch granules from non-carbohydrate plant matter and other extraneous substances, the acid and/or enzymatic hydrolysis of starch and/or cellulose to fermentable sugar (saccharification), the fermentation of sugar to a dilute solution of ethanol and the recovery of anhydrous ethanol by distillation, have been modified in numerous ways to achieve improvements in product yield, production rates and so forth. For ethanol to realize its vast potential as a partial or total substitute for petroleum fuels or as a substitute chemical feedstock, it is necessary that the manufacturing process be as efficient in the use of energy and raw materials as possible so as to maximize the energy return for the amount of ethanol produced and enhance the standing of the ethanol as an economically viable replacement for petroleum-based chemicals. To date, however, relatively little concern has been given to the energy requirements for manufacturing ethanol from biomass and consequently, little effort has been made to minimize the thermal expenditure for carrying out any of the discrete operations involved in the manufacture of ethanol from vegetative sources.

There are three basic methods known for accelerating the fermentation rates of a sugar media to ethanol. These methods include 1) increasing the cell density, and/or 2) reducing the concentration of inhibitory compound(s) (with ethanol being most inhibitory due to its osmolality and toxic effects) in the media as suggested by Dale in prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,665,027 and 5,141,861. The third method is to control the growth environment; such as with trace elements, vitamins, amino acid, pH, and temperature (Biology of Microorganisms, 7thedition, Brock, Madigan, Martinko and Parler. Prenitice Hall, New Jersey 1994). During a normal batch ethanol fermentation with standardS. cerevisaestrains, a final cell concentration of between 1.5 and 15 g/l cells is achieved. It is often noted that cell growth completely stops after a certain cell density is reached (Holzberg et al, 1967). The oxygen tension in the fermentation is important in these batch fermentations, as the cells will convert a larger fraction of the sugar substrate towards cell mass production as the amount of oxygen available to the cells increases. Trace oxygen can serve as a nutrient during the anaerobic fermentation of sugars, allowing more cell production that results in a greater fermentation rate of sugar to ethanol. Cysewski and Wilke (1978) show an optimal oxygen tension of about 0.1 mm O2. To maintain a cell density higher than the natural maximum attained in the fermenter, methods for keeping the cells in the fermenter must be utilized. A high cell density can be maintained either by recycling cells (through membrane or centrifugal techniques) or by retaining or immobilizing the cells within the reactor. Immobilization would seem to be advantageous as the capital expense of a cell recovery and recycle system can be eliminated. There has been a good deal of work over the last 10-15 years on immobilizing organisms to maintain a high cell density in the bioreactor. Immobilization can take one of several approaches, 1) entrapment within a gel bead or plate, 2) adsorption onto a solid matrix, or 3) self-agglomeration or flocculation into flakes or pellets.

Increasing temperature generally speeds a fermentation until the temperature becomes high enough to cause cell death. Fermentation rates are generally noted to increase from 20° to 32° C., doubling with a 5° C. increase in temperature.

The traditional process of fermentation is carried out in a conventional batch operation utilizing yeast as the fermenting organism. To increase the efficiency a variation of the batch operation occasionally includes recycling of the yeast cells by systems such as sedimentation, centrifugation, or ultrafiltration. Normally this batch operation is conducted in two stages. The first stage involves propagation of the yeast and is referred to as the growth stage. The second stage involves the anaerobic process of ethanol production which is accompanied by a depletion of the oxygen. Further propagation of the yeast occurs during the anaerobic process of ethanol production.

Typically, a yeast inoculum is prepared in stage one. The requirements for maximum yeast reproduction are adequate amounts of carbon, nitrogen, minerals and oxygen, a pH in the range of 3.5 to 4.5, and a temperature in the range of 29°-35° C. Aerobic growth conditions define a system for more efficient production of yeast but under which no ethanol is produced. Stage two is the fermentation stage where the alcohol is actually produced by the yeast from the fermentable sugars. The yeast inoculum produced in stage one is used to seed a large fermenter containing glucose at appropriate pH, temperature and sugar concentration. Glucose was formed from the conversion of dextrins via saccharification enzymes. The dextrins were derived from molasses, corn starch materials, etc. via liquification enzymes. The inoculation rate can be 5 to 10 million cells per ml and during the fermentation the viable cell count can increase to 150-200 million cells per ml. Heat produced is controlled through the use of cooling coils. At these yeast levels, a final ethanol concentration of about 9 to 11% (v/v) can be obtained in 30 to 70 hours with batch fermentation. Increasing the yeast content, as is the case with cell recycle, can considerably reduce the time required for completion of the fermentation. For example, with a cell density of 800 to 1000 million cells per ml, it is possible to reduce the fermentation time to 4 to 10 hours.

Processes for the continuous fermentation of sugars to provide alcohol are also well known (U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,155,134; 2,371,208; 2,967,107; 3,015,612; 3,078,166; 3,093,548; 3,177,005; 3,201,328; 3,207,605; 3,207,606; 3,219,319; 3,234,026; 3,413,124; 3,528,887; 3,575,813; 3,591,454; 3,705,841; 3,737,323; and 3,940,492 “Process Design and Economic Studies of Alternative Fermentation Methods for the Production of Ethanol”, Cysewski, et al. Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol. xx, pp. 1421-1444 (1978)). In a typical continuous fermentation process, a stream of sterile sugar liquor and a quantity of yeast cells are introduced into the first of a battery of fermentation vessels wherein initial fermentation takes place, generally under conditions favoring rapid cell growth. The partial fermentate admixed with yeast cells is continuously withdrawn from the first fermentation vessel wherein fermentation is carried out under conditions favoring the rapid conversion of sugar to ethanol. The yeast in the last fermentation vessel can be recovered by suitable means, e.g., centrifugation or settlement, and recycled. In such a system, the ability of the fermentation organism to produce ethanol is affected by the ethanol and sugar concentrations. As a rule, a yeast which gives high conversion rates of sugar to ethanol in a low-ethanol, high-sugar fermentation medium will only sluggishly produce ethanol under the opposite conditions, i.e., at high-ethanol level, low-sugar concentrations.

In general, however, the price of bioethanol has not been competitive with that of traditional fossil fuels and it is therefore highly needed to reduce production costs as far as possible by optimizing or improving upon bioethanol production technologies.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an anaerobic fermentation process to enhance or improve ethanol yield, and decrease fermentation time. A process is disclosed using a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions for the enhanced production of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar containing source. The process for producing ethanol by anaerobic fermentation comprises converting a carbohydrate or sugar source to ethanol using an ethanol producing microorganism in a fermentation broth, wherein said fermentation broth contains one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water, whereby said ethanol production is enhanced.

In another embodiment, a fermentation broth containing bicarbonate ions is used to increase or enhance ethanol production from the fermentation of an ethanol producing microorganism. A fermentation broth for the fermentation of ethanol from a carbohydrate or sugar source can comprise an ethanol producing microorganism, one or more carbohydrate or sugar sources, a nitrogen source, bicarbonate ions from a source of bicarbonate ions and water.

The present invention provides a viable commercial method for ethanol production and can be used in, for example, fuel ethanol, industrial, cheese, brewing, and wine making industries.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a manually held and operated toothbrush or to a powered toothbrush which includes a handle and a head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts or other groupings. The strand groupings are attached to the head either before or after forming the toothbrush handle.

Various attempts have been made for providing flexibility to the manner in which the bristles are attached. Various approaches have also been taken wherein the bristle carrying surface of the head is not flat. U.S. Pat. No. 1,688,581, for example, discloses a toothbrush having a bristle carrying member which is ordinarily bowed inwardly into the hollow head. The bristle carrying member can be bowed outwardly by manipulating a wire mounted in the toothbrush.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush having an oral care region attached to a handle. The oral care region has a membrane which provides flexible movement of tooth cleaning elements.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes an oral care region with a membrane having attachment of at least one tooth cleaning element. The membrane may be generally curvilinear shaped and resiliently flexible when a brushing force is applied to the tooth cleaning element. In another embodiment, tooth cleaning elements are mounted to the membrane. The tooth cleaning elements may be attached using an anchor free tufting process. In an alternative embodiment, the cleaning elements may be spaced so as to allow separation of a melted proximal portion of the cleaning elements and a portion of the membrane extends downwardly from an underside thereof and between adjacent cleaning elements.

In another embodiment, a toothbrush head includes a portion membrane material depending downwardly and a positioned between the islands of tooth cleaning elements. The portion of membrane material prevents flow of a melted nylon material of the cleaning elements from merging with the melted portion of another cleaning element. The isolation of the molten nylon material enables the cleaning elements to move independently of each other during a brushing operation to enhance oral care.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush with an improved cleaning head and manufacturing method.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes provided with tufts of bristles and multi-part wheeled hub designs have drawbacks. During the brushing process, dentifrice slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is greatly reduced.

Another drawback of a multi-part wheeled design is the need for space on the sides of the wheels to mount the hubs. The areas adjacent to the hubs must be free of bristles, as the bristle mounting would interfere with the hub function. Large areas of brush head interior that are devoid of bristles greatly reduce cleaning efficiency of conventional toothbrushes. Furthermore, assembled wheeled hub designs have multiple parts to track and assemble. The assembly time and tracking of the parts can be costly in a manufacturing operation.

Hence, there is a need for a toothbrush with a radial design which increases the cleaning effectiveness and is more efficient to manufacture.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to a toothbrush with radial oriented cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of a user's teeth.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes a head with a group of tooth cleaning elements generally defining a radial array being integral with the head. In one construction, each radial array is formed by a plurality of independently flexible cleaning elements so as to maintain user comfort and provide improved cleaning of the teeth.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes a radial array with a fluid retaining portion for retaining dentifrice on the toothbrush to intensify the cleaning action.

In one embodiment, a radial array of cleaning elements is strategically oriented at an angle to the longitudinal axis of head to maximize the cleaning effect of brushing motions for overall improved cleaning of the teeth, including the interproximal areas between the teeth, along the gum line, and the lingual and facial side surfaces of the teeth.

In one embodiment, there is provided a method of manufacturing a toothbrush head. A base of a toothbrush head is molded in a first direction that may be vertical, horizontal or at an angle. In a subsequent operation, at least one radial array is molded on to the base of the toothbrush head. The mold halves forming the radial array move in a second direction that is different from the first direction.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a device and method for generating a chemical agent in situ. In particular, the present invention relates to a device, such as a toothbrush, that generates a chemical agent in situ by applying an electrical potential across a pair of conductors in communication with an electrolytic solution.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products include a variety of chemical agents that perform a range of functions. For instance, toothpastes, mouthwashes and whiteners include chemical agents that help to clean teeth, kill bacteria, freshen breath and/or whiten teeth. These products typically cooperate with a device such as a toothbrush, an applicator device, or a tongue scraper, to perform their intended functions. In addition, chemical agents in these products may provide secondary benefits such as providing pleasing flavors or odors.

Many oral care products are configured to be multi-functional. For example, conventional toothpaste is configured to assist with multiple functions, such as cleaning teeth, fighting tartar, providing fluoride protection, freshening breath and whitening teeth. As such, the concentrations and types of chemical agents therein are limited by chemical interaction considerations and by chemical stability considerations thereof during prolonged storage.

Oral care products that are directed to whitening teeth include an oxidizing agent as the primary active ingredient, such as hydrogen peroxide. These products are formulated into liquids, pastes or gels for application to users' teeth. Upon storage, these products lose their whitening efficacy over time. In addition, these products have a brief period of efficacy when applied to the teeth in the oral cavity. For example, saliva contains high concentrations of the enzyme catalase, which on contact rapidly decomposes hydrogen peroxide into gaseous oxygen and water and so that there is only transitory contact of the peroxide whitening agent with the teeth. In addition, the low viscosities of aqueous peroxide solutions do not allow the peroxide whitening agent to remain in contact with the teeth for as long as is necessary to effect substantive whitening, because of the constant flushing effects of salivary secretions. As such, it is desirable to have high concentrations of oxidizing agents or effective oxidizing agents applied directly to teeth.

Toothbrushes are known that generate beneficial agents, including oxidizing agents when needed during brushing. U.S. Pat. No. 5,921,251 to Joshi discloses a toothbrush that generates beneficial oral care agents within the toothbrush when needed during brushing and that delivers them to the user's teeth once they are generated. The Joshi toothbrush generates within the toothbrush handle a fluid containing an oxidizing agent, which it delivers to the toothbrush bristles. The agent is generated via an electrochemical gas-generating cell within the toothbrush handle or via a photoelectrochemical cell within the handle.

The Joshi toothbrush does not generate its beneficial agents in situ at the application site, but instead generates them internally and subsequently transfers them to the application site. The Joshi toothbrush generates its beneficial agents from an electrolyte stored within the toothbrush handle (using its electrochemical gas generator), or it generates them from a catalyst stored within the handle via the application of light from an internal light source.

Toothbrushes are also known that generate ionized molecules by applying a voltage across electrodes on a toothbrush handle in contact with a dentifrice slurry. U.S. Pat. No. 6,496,998 to Moran; U.S. Patent Publication 2003/0054321 to Moran; and U.S. Patent Publication 2002/0177107 to Moran each discloses a toothbrush that generates weak acids of fluoride via the application of an electric charge to electrodes on the toothbrush handle in contact with an aqueous dentifrice containing sodium fluoride. The Moran toothbrushes generate fluoride ions by applying a three-volt electric charge to the aqueous slurry containing sodium fluoride. It also generates diatomic oxygen and hydrogen ions via the electrolysis of water in the slurry from same electric charge. The hydrogen ions combine with the fluoride ions to produce weak acids of fluoride (HF), which reduce the amount of acid-producing bacteria in plaque. The Moran references do not disclose a toothbrush that generates oxidizing agents other than oxygen itself via the application of an electric charge to an electrolyte. Further, the Moran references disclose generating oxygen and hydrogen ions along the toothbrush handle and do not disclose generating oxidizing agents in situ at the application site within a field of cleaning elements.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a device that generates a chemical agent in situ via the application of an electrical potential across a pair of conductors in communication with an electrolytic solution. In one embodiment, the device is a toothbrush that generates chemical agents in a user's mouth by applying an electrical potential to an aqueous electrolyte, such as a toothpaste slurry, located therein. The chemical agents may include ozone, hydrogen peroxide, or other substances depending on factors such as the composition of the electrolyte and the construction of the toothbrush. The toothbrush includes a voltage source and a first set of electrodes for applying an electrical potential to the aqueous electrolyte.

In a low voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate ions from the aqueous electrolyte, such as calcium ions, hydrogen ions, hydroxide ions and fluoride ions. In a higher voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate hydrogen peroxide and ozone. In another low voltage construction, the toothbrush includes a second set of electrodes disposed about an anode of the first set of electrodes. The first and second sets of anodes cooperate to produce hydrogen, oxygen, ions, peroxides and/or ozone via the application of a low voltage to the aqueous electrolyte and to oxygen generated thereby. In a high voltage construction, the toothbrush can generate hydrogen, oxygen and ozone.

Other aspects of the present invention provide methods for generating chemical agents in situ within a field of cleaning elements of the oral care device. These and other aspects are addressed in relation to the figures and related description.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to tooth-brushes which include rotating sections in the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a powered toothbrush and in particular to a toothbrush head having movably mounted bristles. Various types of powered tooth-brushes are generally known in the art. Reference is made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,625,916 which relates to an electrically driven toothbrush having a motor drive for rotating a drive shaft. The drive shaft is connected to a bristle holder on the head of the toothbrush in such a manner that rotation of the drive shaft causes the bristle holder to rotationally oscillate back and forth. Various other arrangements are known for oscillating a bristle holder mounted to the head of an electric toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,416,942 shows a further type of powered toothbrush wherein the head includes a pair of concentrically arranged sections, each of which is driven in a rotational oscillating manner in opposite directions. The toothbrush head, however, includes only the two counter-oscillating sections. The head does not include any other sections on which bristles may be mounted.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,032,313 discloses a household appliance which would be used for cleaning, polishing or massaging. One such appliance is a toothbrush. The head has a plurality of co-axially rotatable or parallel linearly movable sections. No provision is made on the head for other bristle containing sections.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,070,567 discloses an electrically driven toothbrush which includes a rotatable brush head having bristles thereon. Adjacent to the brush head are a further group of bristles each of which rotates around its own axis.

U.S. Pat. No. 1,796,641 relates to a spotting brush usable for dry-cleaning wherein a pair of side by side heads are rotatably mounted.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An object of this invention is to provide a powered toothbrush which includes counter-rotational or oscillating sections and a further section having bristles to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical powered toothbrush.

In accordance with this invention the toothbrush head includes a first section or tuft block which is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction parallel to the outer surface of the toothbrush head. A second section or tuft block is mounted for oscillating back and forth in a rotational direction also parallel to the toothbrush head, but in counter-oscillation to the direction of the first tuft block. A third section or tuft block is provided on the toothbrush head and also contains bristles.

In various practices of the invention the third section could be a fixed non-moving section wherein the bristles are also fixed. Alternatively, the bristles on the fixed section could be mounted movably in an elastomer material on the section to permit independent movement of such bristles, although the fixed section remains stationary.

In other practices of the invention the third section could be a movable section which oscillates back and forth in a direction parallel to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head or in a direction transverse to the longitudinal axis of the toothbrush head. In yet another alternative practice of the invention the third section could oscillate in and out in a direction perpendicular to the outer surface of the toothbrush head to form a vibrating section which vibrating section may or may not simultaneously oscillate back and forth.

In a preferred practice of the invention the second tuft head is mounted within and concentric to the first tuft block. The bristles of the first tuft block may extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head a greater distance than the bristles of the second tuft head so as to create a cup-like shape which would facilitate retaining the toothpaste on the first and second tuft heads.

The third section is preferably mounted longitudinally in line with the first and second sections so that the portion of the head containing the bristles of the first, second and third sections is of an elongated shape which would also facilitate holding an elongated ribbon of toothpaste on the bristles.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

The present application is a U.S. national stage application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2010/061878, filed Dec. 22, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to the field of packaging oral care implements, and specifically to a package of oral care implements having a moisture sensitive pre-applied oral care material.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, oral care implements cannot be used due to a lack of a water source, such as when a user is driving in a vehicle or on-the-go. Oral care implements that can be used without a water source have recently been developed. For example, oral care implements have been developed that provide an oral care material within the oral care implement itself, such as through an integrated channel, for distribution through the oral care implement to the bristles. Disposable waterless oral care implements that utilize a pre-applied moisture sensitive capsule have also been introduced into the market.

Oral care implements, such as those described above, must be maintained in a sealed environment prior to use in order to prevent moisture from prematurely degrading and/or releasing the oral care material. As such, these oral care implements must be carefully packaged. Furthermore, users of disposable oral care implements need a place to dispose the oral care implements after use. Disposable oral care implements of the type discussed above are currently packaged in a plastic clamshell packages that are individually foil-sealed for protection. If a user uses a disposable oral care implement in a vehicle or another “on-the-go” location, the user must resort to either leaving the used disposable oral care implement loose within the vehicle or holding onto it until a proper waste basket can be located.

Hence, there is a need for a package that can contain oral care implements in a moisture-free environment prior to use. Furthermore, there is a need for a package that can contain a plurality of oral care implements such that one of the oral care implements can be removed from the package for use while the remainder of the oral care implements remain in moisture protected environment.

A need also exists for a package that can fit within a vehicle cup holder. Additionally, a need exists for a package that has a built-in “waste basket” compartment for disposal of the oral care implements after use.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a package of oral care implements. The package has a central cavity and an annular cavity that circumferentially surrounds the central cavity. The annular cavity is divided into a plurality of subcavities. The package also has a rotatable cover that seals the subcavities from moisture in the external environment. The rotatable cover has a central opening that allows used oral care implements to be inserted into the central cavity for disposal and a dispensing opening through which unused oral care implements can be withdrawn from the subcavities

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition and its method of production, as well as its use as an animal litter. Particularly, the present invention relates to an absorbent composition that coats animal waste and provides an effective odor control.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owners had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. Housebroken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added liquid-absorbing materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The most commonly used litter box liquid-absorbing materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, and cellulose. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. The entire contents of the litter box including the soiled and unsoiled liquid-absorbing materials will eventually be removed because of the offensive odor caused by the absorbed urine and feces.

Most litters do not adequately control the odor associated with urine. The simple absorption of liquid, which litters typically provide, does little to counteract the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Currently clay soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, are used in an attempt to improve litter compositions. Sodium bentonites absorb liquid waste such as urine, and may also absorb some of the odor associated with the liquid waste, as the material binds amine compounds in the “face sites” of the clay interlayers. Plant-based litters, such as those made from wood chips or corn, can also absorb liquid waste, and be made disposable with the aid of clumping agents, but, again, litter box odor remains. This is because a significant contributor to “litter box smell” is the odor resulting from bacterial action on “aged” urine after three or so days in a litter box. In some cases, some of the urine can even collect and pool at the bottom of the litter box making an excellent breeding ground for bacteria. It is this bacteria from “old urine” in the litter box that most litters do not cover up well, and which is particularly troublesome to consumers.

Moreover, traditional plant-based or clay-based litters that are composed of sodium bentonites or other materials do not address the issue of fecal odor. Fecal odor differs from urine odor in that the odor is produced immediately at the time of defecation. Materials in fecal odor that carry an especially strong impact include butyric acid, p-cresol, skatole, and dimethyltrisulfide.

Furthermore, these traditional litter compositions are often formed from coarse granules, such that the granule's irregularity in both shape and size creates tracking by animals after usage, and dust formation that is associated with granule bumping.

There is also a concern of the rising cost of litter ingredients due to limited resources or unexpected high demands. For example, guar gum, a clumping agent, is also used in hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to adjust fracturing fluid viscosity. The recent popularity of fracking has driven up the cost of guar gum dramatically, forcing other industries to search for an alternative.

Various attempts to address the above issues are known in the art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 8,074,604 to Swank teaches an animal litter that includes a sorbent material that is composed of granule particulate, which is able to pass a −20 screen sieve. The sorbent material is combined with a binder such that greater than 90% of the granules have a size of between −5 and +60 screen sieve. The Swank granules also have an oil coating. The feedstocks operative in the Swank invention include corncob, bentonite, diatomaceous earth, attapulgite, montmorillonite, cellulosic plant stalks, husks and hulls, and combinations thereof.

US Patent Application Numbers 2009/000562 and 2012/0012064 to Jenkins et al. teach a waste encapsulating animal litter that encapsulates the solid and liquid animal waste within a shell that has a thickness of at least 1 mm, and wherein the litter comprises a water reactive polymer as a binder, an acidic solid material, and a carbonate-containing or percarbonate-containing solid material.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,101,771 to Goss teaches an animal litter made from clay materials and a combination of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, a clumping agent, and mineral oil, which acts as a dedusting agent.

The above references teach improvements of the traditional litters and disclose modifying base particle sizes and the use of additives such as binders and acids. However, these references only address one of many concerns and do not present a full solution to the challenges presented in finding a litter which will satisfy consumer needs. Further improvements must be implemented to effectively reduce tracking and odors, while yielding a litter which may be economically manufactured.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed toward a superior performance clay-based animal litter which comprises a clay-based liquid-absorbing material, and at least one filler that is coated with at least one clumping agent. The particle size of the liquid-absorbing materials is small enough to provide the litter with a “sandy” appearance. This superior litter is found surprisingly effective in coating animal waste, thereby dramatically reducing odors. This is accomplished by maximizing the litter's contact with the waste to intercept and block odor emanating from the surface. In addition, the small particle size reduces tracking and dusting. Moreover, it does not contain foaming agents and/or acids, nor does it require foams to encapsulate the waste in order to block odors.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to an improved device for assaying a preselected analyte, such as an antigen, in a body fluid, such as urine, and more particularly relates to such a device including electronic interpretation of the read area in a lateral flow strip, for electronically providing a display of the results of the interpretation.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of ligand-receptor assays have been developed to detect the presence of a preselected analyte in body fluid. Typically, these assays involve antibody-antigen interactions, synthetic conjugates comprising radioactively, enzymatically, spectroscopically, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) that is specific for the preselected analyte (e.g., an antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of a resulting receptor-analyte (e.g., antibody-antigen) complex. Most current assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative result, i.e., a positive or negative signal. Examples of such qualitative assays include, for example, pregnancy tests, ovulation tests as well as a variety of other types of urine analysis. In these tests, visually observable signals such as the presence of agglutination of a color change are preferred.

The assays optimally are performed using single-step devices wherein the only step the user need perform prior to observation of the result is application of the sample to be assayed onto the device. Single-step devices, therefore, obviate the necessity of performing, subsequent to the application of the sample, a series of manipulations which may be time consuming and/or may introduce errors in the end result. Accordingly, several single-step devices, for example those described in International Application Nos. WO 88/08534, published Nov. 3, 1988, have been developed and are commercially available.

The single-step device described in International Application Published No. WO 88/08534 comprises a hollow casing containing a porous assay material communicating with the exterior of the casing via a fluid sample receiving member. During operation, the user applies the fluid test sample onto the fluid sample receiving member protruding out of the casing. Thereafter, the fluid sample while traversing the carrier material enters the casing and moves to a capture region disposed upon the carrier material. The capture region comprises a means for binding a preselected analyte. When the fluid sample reaches the capture region, assuming that the fluid sample contains the analyte, the analyte binds to the capture region. The bound analyte subsequently can be visualized within the capture region.

It has been found, however, that invalid test results may arise from the use of single-step devices, particularly devices wherein the fluid sample is applied directly from a fluid stream through a urine inlet port defined by the casing onto assay material enclosed therein.

An improved single-step test device for detecting the presence of a preselected analyte in an urine stream is described in the above-cited U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,046,057 and 6,277,650. The device includes a hollow rectangular outer casing and an assay material disposed within co-joined upper and lower sections of the casing. The outer casing includes a urine inlet port; a viewing window in the upper section; at least the upper section consisting of transparent material; and may also include at least one drainage vent spaced about the urine inlet port. The assay material is a sorptive material including: a urine sample application region adjacent to, and in fluid communication with the urine inlet port; a capture region adjacent to the viewing window; and a fluid flow path for transporting a liquid sample between the urine sample application region and the analyte capture region. The flow of urine in the fluid path is observable through the transparent upper section for confirming a test is operative. The drainage vent is located to permit excess urine entering the casing from the urine stream to exit the casing thereby to minimize hydraulic pressure induced flooding of the assay material disposed within the casing and to reduce the frequency of false test results. In this improved device, a colloidal gold label antibody reagent is deposited on a release region of assay material. When, in this example, urine is applied to the sample absorbent material8, the urine moves by capillary action or sorbent movement downstream toward window. When the urine contacts the reagent, it reconstitutes the reagent material, causing the reagent to move with the urine front along the flow path. When the reconstituted marker reagent passes through the window region11, capture means are included in the capture region85to cause a single colored line to appear indicative of no pregnancy, or a double line to appear indicative of pregnancy. Although this device represented a very positive improvement over the prior single-step test devices, a user must interpret the lines that appear in the associated window to determine whether or not the test result is indicative of pregnancy. The present inventors recognized that if the requirement for a user to have to interpret between single colored lines and double lines can be eliminated, whereby a simple display of the word Yes+ for pregnancy, or No− for non-pregnancy, could be provided in a further improved such device, mistakes in interpretation by a user can be substantially eliminated. Note that as previously indicated above, the aforesaid two patents, and the present invention, are all commonly owned.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, with the problems in the prior art in mind, it is an object of the present invention to provide both an improved single-step detection device for reliably detecting the presence of a preselected analyte within a body fluid, when the body fluid, an example being urine, is applied directly from a fluid stream, a urine stream for example, onto assay material disposed within the device, and to provide electronic interpretation of the test results for displaying in a window Yes+ as being indicative of pregnancy, or No− indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

It is another object of the invention to provide a method for detecting a preselected analyte using a single-step device including electronic interpretation as described herein.

It is yet another object of the invention to provide a method for producing a single-step detection device including electronic or electro-optical means for interpreting and displaying test results, as described herein.

Yet another object of the invention is to provide a method and apparatus for permitting a user, after applying a fluid sample onto assay material, to shortly thereafter view the test results in a window consisting of the word Yes+ being displayed indicative of pregnancy, or the word No− being displayed indicative of non pregnancy, for example.

One embodiment, the present invention provides a device having an outer casing enclosing an assay material, and electro-optical system means, for detecting the presence of an analyte in a urine stream. The assay material defines a capture region for binding the analyte. The outer casing includes a removable cap for exposing a portion of a sample wick to which urine is applied directly from a urine stream, whereafter the cap can be reinstalled. The urine flows from the sample wick onto a test strip containing assaying material. The electro-optical means monitors the overall operation of the device in the capture region for interpreting the test results, and for displaying the results on a small display screen located in a viewing window. The electro-optical means includes electronic processing means for interpreting changes in color in the capture region, such as a test result producing two lines indicative of pregnancy, or one line indicative of non-pregnancy, whereby the processing means displays Yes+ on the display for pregnancy, and No− for non pregnancy, for example. In one embodiment of the present invention, the display is a liquid crystal display (LCD).

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to deodorizing compositions and methods of deodorizing animal litter. More specifically it relates to deodorizing compositions for animal litter, wherein the compositions are contacted with the litter by being sprayed onto the litter.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

Presently it is common for pet owners to train their house-broken animals to use absorbing compositions commonly known as litters to urinate and defecate. Pet owners later collect portions of the litter that are saturated with urine and remove feces of their animals. Animal litters usually contain clayey or other absorbent materials. It is beneficial if the litter contains clumping clay. Clumping clays swell after they absorb water-based liquids such as urine and form clumps that are easy to be removed by the pet owner. If a non-clumping clay is the main absorbing ingredient of the litter, then clumping agents or clumping enhancers may be added to the litter to ensure clump formation. The pet owner has to remove the feces and absorbent with the urine quite often in order to prevent emission of unpleasant odors into the surrounding area in their home or apartment. Furthermore, even when the pet owner frequently removes the fecal matter and clumps of absorbent material saturated with urine from the litter, it does not reduce or eliminate odors caused by the remaining uncollected small amounts of absorbent saturated with urine and difficult to collect small pieces of feces.

Animal litters often contain a deodorizing agent. A deodorizing agent that is mixed in with the absorbent material may not be dispersed uniformly in the bag or a box containing the litter or in the litter pan itself and may sink to the bottom. Additional means might be provided to improve the distribution of the deodorizing agent within the litter (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,291 to Lawson et al.). Various litter additives attempting to eliminate unpleasant odors of animal litter are known. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,005,520 to Michael describes a litter additive comprising a perborate and a desiccant, wherein when the waste material comes into contact with the peroxide or peroxygen compound, enough oxygen is produced to oxidize odoriferous compounds into non-odoriferous compounds. U.S. Pat. No. 5,295,456 to Lawson describes a litter additive that includes particles of sodium or potassium bicarbonate coated with mineral oil and agglomerated with expanded perlite. U.S. Pat. No. 6,015,547 to Yam discloses zinc ions solution sprayed onto sodium bicarbonate particles of sufficient size, so that they do not fully dissolve in the aqueous phase. The coated particles are then combined with appropriate absorbent materials of animal litter.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,041,279 to Ali et al. describes an aqueous deodorizing composition comprising an alkali metal tetraborate n-hydrate, a water-soluble/dispersible polymer and a volatile solvent. This composition while acting as urease inhibitor and having bacteriostatic properties creates a film when applied and dried to provide a matrix in which the boron additive, other materials, and animal waste are entrapped.

As the objectionable odors emanating from animal litter continue to remain a problem, an effort has been put into developing deodorizers for animal litters. The deodorizers available on the market can be added to the already purchased animal litter. For example, “Stink Free” brand litter and litter box spray powder deodorizer is a commercial deodorizer that is sprayed in the form of the liquid that later dries to create a solid physical barrier on the bottom of the litter box that prevents the odor contamination of the box and prevents litter from sticking to the box. When applied to the top of dirty litter, it forms a blanket that encapsulates and destroys the odors. A dense layer of powder accumulated on a litter might produce a crust and prevent proper absorption of urine by the absorbent material by allowing for the urine to remain on top of the crust, and therefore inhibit flow of the urine into the absorbent material.

Other available on the market cat litter deodorizers, including, for example, Tidy Cats®, Nil-O-Litter™, and Arm & Hammer® deodorizers, are usually provided in a powder form. They are meant to be added to and mixed with the clumping or non-clumping litter and additionally may be sprinkled on top of it.

These compositions and available products appear to pose several problems. Safety of the animals may be compromised because of the oxygen producing compounds. Additionally, there is the necessity to mix the powdered deodorizers with the litter and a possible lack of uniformity of the distribution of the additive within the litter. Further problems are created by a possibility of crust formation on the surface of the litter, when the deodorizing composition is applied in a liquid form and/or forms a film on the surface of the litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

There is provided an aqueous liquid deodorizing composition for animal litter, and a method of deodorizing animal litter by contacting the litter with the composition by spraying. The aqueous composition includes a crusting inhibitor in sufficient quantity to inhibit surface crusting of clumping clay litters but not enough to inhibit the normal clumping properties of the clay.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of treating surfaces to kill and/or prevent fungi and bacteria growth and protect from allergens by applying onto the surface a novel aqueous silane quaternary ammonium composition.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold can cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms. Molds can cause unwanted odors, produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or even asthma attacks in people allergic to mold. Other molds are known to produce potent toxins and/or irritants. Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth. Molds can also hasten the deterioration of surfaces and structural components of buildings.

Molds reproduce by making spores that usually cannot be seen without magnification. Mold spores waft through the indoor and outdoor air continually. When mold spores land on a damp area, the spores may begin growing and digesting whatever media such as spores are growing on in order to survive. Molds gradually destroy the area on which the spores grow.

Mold spores can be found in the air and on nearly every surface in a home, but generally a consistent source of moisture is required for mold to grow. Molds can grow on virtually any organic substance, as long as moisture and oxygen are present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, ceramic, concrete, plastics, textiles, and foods.

Many types of molds exist. Molds such as mold, fungus mold, and slime molds are most often found in areas that have high humidity levels such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms or damp basements (especially after flooding). Outdoor structures that are often wetted or remain damp are also areas of mold growth. Thus, roofs, fences, porches, pools and the like are often damaged by continual mold growth. Molds are a type of microscopic fungus that can grow naturally indoors and outdoors. The most common household mold types includeAspergillus, Cladosporium, PenicilliumandAlternaria. Stachybotrys chartarum, often referred to as black mold, is less common than the molds listed above and is the type of mold commonly dealt with in home remediations.

Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that are used to prevent microbiological contamination and deterioration of products, materials, and systems. Of the diverse categories of antimicrobial agents and compositions, quaternary ammonium compounds represent one of the largest of the classes of agents in use. At low concentrations, quaternary ammonium type antimicrobial agents are bacteriostatic, fungistatic, algistatic, sporostatic, and tuberculostatic. At medium concentrations they are bactericidal, fungicidal, algicidal, and viricidal against lipophilic viruses. Silicone containing quaternary ammonium compounds are well known as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,385, and the use of such compounds as antimicrobial agents is taught, for example, in a wide variety of patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701, and 3,817,739, where the compounds are used to inhibit algae; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,794,736 and 3,860,709 where they are employed for sterilizing or disinfecting a variety of surfaces and instruments; U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,728, where the compounds are used to treat aquarium filters; U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,103; and in British Patent No. 1,386,876. Published unexamined European Application No. 228464 of Jul. 15, 1987, teaches that microorganisms on plants can be killed by the application thereto of an aqueous mixture of a surfactant and an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a particular application of an antimicrobial silicone quaternary ammonium compound, a paper substrate is rendered resistant to the growth of microorganisms in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,366. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,541, an antimicrobial fabric is disclosed which is resistant to discoloration and yellowing by treatment of the fabric with a quaternary ammonium base containing an organosilicone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,937, as well as its companion U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,374, relate to wet wiper towelettes having an antimicrobial agent substantive to the fibers of the web and being an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a series of patents assigned to Burlington Industries, Inc. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,408,996, 4,414,268, 4,425,372, and 4,395,454, such compounds are disclosed to be useful in surgical drapes, dressings, and bandages. This same assignee also discloses these compounds as being employed in surgeons' gowns in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,928 and 4,467,013. Organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds have been employed in carpets in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,577; applied to walls, added to paints, and sprayed into shoes, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,378; applied to polyethylene surfaces and used in pillow ticking in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,511; in flexible polyurethane foams of fine-celled, soft, resilient articles of manufacture in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,297; and mixed with a nonionic surfactant in Japanese Kokai Application No. 60-048908, filed Aug. 26, 1983, of Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the purpose of achieving uniformity of distribution of compounds to a textile surface. Thus the versatility of such compositions is readily apparent.

For organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n is an integer from 0 to 2, hydrolysis of the first two X groups with water produces a species bearing —Si(OH)2— units which can self-condense through the hydroxyl moieties to linear and/or cyclic oligomers possessing the partial structure HO—Si—(O—Si)mm—O—Si—O—Si—O—Si—OH, where mm is an integer such that an oligomer is formed. For those cases, RSiX3, hydrolysis of the third X group generates a silanetriol (RSi(OH)3) which produces insoluble organosilicon polymers through linear and/or cyclic self-condensation of the Si(OH) units. This water induced self-condensation generally precludes storage of most organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n ranges from 0 to 2, inclusive, in water. Except for some organosilanes which can be stable in very dilute solutions at specific pH ranges, the use of water solutions of most organosilanes require the use of freshly prepared solutions. Quaternary ammonium organosilanes are often applied from solvent solutions such as lower alcohols and the commercial versions of these quaternized organosilanes are commonly provided as methanolic solutions.

Quaternary ammonium functional organosilanes containing hydrolyzable groups such as those sold under the trademark AEM® 5772 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride) by Aegis Environmental Co. of Midland, Mich. and REQUAT® 1977 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethyldi(decyl)ammonium chloride) by Sanitized, Inc. of New Preston, Conn. have found a large number of uses because of their ability to attach themselves to a wide variety of substrates where the quaternary ammonium functional group then acts as an antimicrobial and algicidal agent. Substrates treated with such quaternized organosilanes have also been noted to, among other things, be easier to clean, possess soil release properties, and cause hair to exhibit a conditioned appearance.

A clear microemulsion of a quaternized organosilane using a cosurfactant having an HLB value of at least 1 is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,766 to Blehm et al. This patent teaches that the methanol-based solvent in which the organosilane is supplied must be removed before blending the quaternized organosilane with the cosurfactant (e.g., a nonionic surfactant can used). If the methanol is not removed, a creamy white emulsion forms which is unstable and will separate into oil and water phases over time. The '766 patent also teaches that high shear may have to be applied to the mixtures of organosilane and cosurfactant to ensure codispersion.

Obviously, this has the disadvantage of requiring a homogenization step to prepare such microemulsions. Blehm et al. teach that almost any surfactant can be employed including anionic, cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as well as nonionic surfactants although nonionic surfactants and compounds such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and higher monoalcohols such as pentanol, decanol and decanediol are most preferred.

Another patent teaching oil-in-water emulsions containing 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride as well as, optionally, cosurfactants such as nonionic and cationic surfactants, is U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,273 to Blehm et al. These emulsions employ a homogenizer using high shear conditions and teach that the quaternized organosilane does not hydrolyze while it is in emulsion form and thus does not polymerize to an insoluble siloxane. The Examples use ARQUAD® T27W cationic surfactant which is trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride. However, these emulsions also require a water immiscible liquid such as a polydimethylsiloxane or a mineral oil with which the quaternized organosilane associates. Blehm et al. teach that a sufficient shear force is necessary to form the emulsions and that an Eppenbach mixer did not provide a sufficient amount of such shear.

Therefore, there exists a need for extended shelf life, water-stable organosilane compounds, such as silane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions thereof that, upon application, the active portion of the organosilane is operative for the selected application. Moreover, there exists a need for water-stable, organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions which are essentially non-toxic, non-flammable, uniformly dispersable, and simple and economical to manufacture and use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising an organosilane quaternary ammonium component, and an alkali bicarbonate component for treating a surface susceptible to fungi and bacteria growth, and to protect from the deposition of allergens on the surface. The aqueous composition of this invention is devoid of other polysiloxanes, has a long, stable shelf life, can be readily applied to any surface, and dries quickly once applied. The composition can be made by directly mixing the alcoholic solution of the organosilane quaternary compound to water without the need for removing the alcohol. Once in solution, the composition remains stable even if exposed to air until it is applied, and then dries quickly. The optional addition of surfactant allows the composition to be applied evenly across any surface. The alkali metal bicarbonate improves the antimicrobial properties of the composition and improves the drying time of the applied composition. The composition can be applied to a surface by any conventional coating method, such as by spraying, dipping wiping, roller coating and the like.

The present invention relates generally to brushes, especially toothbrushes, and specifically to an improved anchor or staple design for securing tufts of bristles within the head of the brush.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In the conventional manufacturing process for brushes, particularly toothbrushes, the brushes are injection molded with empty tuft boles in the toothbrush head. The tuft holes may also be drilled after the injection molding as well as initially formed in the head concurrently with the injection molding. In a secondary operation, U shaped tufts of bristles are inserted into the holes in the head. Each tuft of bristles is held in place by a plate-like staple that is wider than the tuft hole so that when the staple is used to drive the U-shaped bristle tufts into the tuft hole, the edges of the staple slightly cut and deform the sides of the hole. The pressure and resulting static friction of the surrounding plastic on the staple contributes to forces maintaining the staple in place. However, there are certain problems associated with brushes made in this manner. Specifically, individual bristles, or even entire tufts of bristles, may occasionally come out of the tuft holes during brushing by a consumer. The staple or anchor art has dealt with these problems in a variety of ways. However, adequately securing tufts of bristles within the tuft holes must be balanced against other considerations, such as costs of materials and the ability to mass manufacture product.

Over the years, toothbrush staples of the rectangular type have become available in which at least one of the major surfaces thereof is provided with parallel horizontal grooves (i.e., grooves that extend parallel with a longitudinal axis of the staple), thereby yielding a staple that has been found to be more resistant to becoming separated from its tuft hole than staples with smooth surfaces.

Staples have also been developed having a rounded edges that eliminate and/or minimize the problem of tuft weakening and possible rupture of filaments or bristles at the bight of the U. With such a rounded construction, the zone or area of contact between the lower staple edge and the bristle filament closely matches the U shape at the bight portion of each tuft. In turn, this permits the staples to be driven deeper into the head and thus a larger and more consistent force can be applied to each U shaped tuft without cutting or damaging the filaments.

More recently, staples having specialized groove patterns on the major surfaces of the staples for improved retention, including a slanted configuration of parallel grooves, have been introduced to the art.

Staples constructed of materials having oligodynamic action have also been disclosed in the art. These oligodynamic staples have smooth major surfaces and are constructed of a material having oligodynamic action, such as cadmium, silver, brass, copper, stainless steel, titanium and mercury.

Typically, toothbrush staples are constructed of a nickel-silver alloy. Due to the costs associated with the nickel-silver alloy, it has long been desired to create staples from cheaper metals, such as brass. While the general concept of using a brass staple has been disclosed, testing and experimentation have proven that merely creating and using a flat-faced brass staple cannot be used in the manufacture of toothbrushes to provide effective tuft retention. Moreover, merely applying known groove patterns has also proven to be ineffective.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the present invention is a staple having an optimized pattern of grooves in at least one of its major surfaces. The optimized groove pattern makes it possible to create the staples out of a material that is more cost effective than a nickel-silver alloy, such as brass, while still providing the necessary tuft retention so as to be utilized in a viable toothbrush product.

In one such embodiment, the invention can be a toothbrush comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; and a brass staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the brass staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of substantially parallel grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the brass staple to a top edge of the brass staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

In another aspect, the present invention is a staple haying a slanted pattern of grooves formed into both major surfaces of the staple. The slope of the slanted pattern of grooves for each major surface is selected so that the patterns on both of the surfaces act in a complimentary and concerted manner to improve tuft retention.

In one such embodiment, the invention is a toothbrush comprising a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; a staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis, a first major surface, and a second major surface; a first set of substantially parallel grooves formed into the first major surface of the staple, each of the grooves in the first set extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple to a top edge of the staple and slanting upward from a first lateral edge of the staple to a second lateral edge of the staple, the linear axis of the first set of grooves intersecting the longitudinal axis at a first acute angle; and a second set of substantially parallel grooves formed into the second major surface of the staple, each of the grooves in the second set extending along a linear axis from the bottom edge of the staple to the top edge of the staple and slanting upward from the second lateral edge of the staple to the first lateral edge of the staple, the linear axis of the second set of grooves intersecting the longitudinal axis at a second acute angle.

In yet another aspect, the invention is a toothbrush comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one tuft hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one tuft of bristles positioned in the tuft hole; a staple located in the tuft hole anchoring the tuft of bristles in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of substantially parallel grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple to a top edge of the staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle; and each of the grooves having a width and adjacent grooves separated by a distance, wherein the ratio of the distance to the width is between 3.0 and 4.0.

In a still further aspect, the invention can be an ansate implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to said handle and having at least one hole extending into the head from a surface; at least one cleaning element positioned in the hole; and to staple located in the hole anchoring the cleaning element in the tuft hole, the staple having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface wherein a plurality of spaced-apart grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the staple toward a top edge of the staple, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

In another aspect, the invention can be a staple for securing cleaning elements within an ansate implement, the staple comprising a flat wire having a longitudinal axis and a first major surface, wherein a plurality of spaced-apart grooves are formed into the first major surface, each of the grooves extending along a linear axis from a bottom edge of the flat wire toward a top edge of the flat wire, the linear axis intersecting the longitudinal axis at an acute angle of 40 to 70 degrees.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a package for a fragrance containing tablet wherein a sample of the tablet fragrance can be sensed outside of the package.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In the use of the fragranced products the user in many instances wants to detect the fragrances prior to making a purchase. With tablets there can be more than one layer of packaging. The tablets will be packaged in a primary package to protect the tablets during shipping and handling and an outer container to hold the primary package. The primary package can be flexible and resilient and the outer container rigid to semi-rigid to provide a stackable unit. The primary package can contain the tablets individually or in a collection of two or more. The primary package also will hold any dust from the tablets when collectively packaged. A dust can result from the contact of the tablets during shipping and handling. The problem is that with a primary package and an outer container the customer will not be able to reasonably perceive the fragrance of the tablets. In order to solve this problem both the primary package prior to purchase and the outer container must be modified. The primary package has to be modified to provide for a low level of transmissivity of the fragrance. The outer container has to be modified or chosen to allow some fragrance from the primary package to be emitted when the container is handled.

It is needed to modify the outer container since if a way of perceiving the fragrances through the outer container is not possible consumers will open the outer container to smell the fragrance. This will result in the destruction of any tamper evident seal. Thus the primary package and the outer container both need to be chosen and/or modified to solve the problem.

The fragrance containing tablets can be those used to provide a refreshing fragrance to a room or other space, those incorporating a detergent for cleaning laundry and those including a fabric softener. The tablet can have the sole function of providing a fragrance directly to a space or can be in combination with another component and have two functions.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed to an overall package for a tablet that contains a fragrance. The package is comprised of a primary package and an outer container. The primary package has a structure that holds a single tablet or will hold a plurality of tablets. It will be in a bag form for holding a plurality of tablets. The film of the primary package will have a perceptible transmissivity for the tablet fragrance for at least six months. Preferably there should be a transmissivity of at least about 0.1 cm3/m2/day/bar at room temperate and atmospheric pressure, and preferably at least about 1 cm3/m2/day/bar of fragrance containing air. Fragrance containing air is air with a fragrance content such that the fragrance can be readily perceived by persons from the public. However, the film of the primary package should not transmit more than about 50%, and preferably not more than about 25%, of the tablet fragrance content at room temperature and atmospheric pressure over a period of 120 days.

The outer container will be comprised of a rigid to semi-rigid thermoplastic, preferably having an openable or removable lid. On a surface of the container there will be least one, and preferably more than one aperture for the passage of fragrance from the interior of the container to the exterior of the container. The apertures will have a total area of about 1 sq. mm up to about 25 sq. mm and preferably about 5 sq. mm up to about 15 sq. mm. In this way the apertures in the outer container and the fragrance transmissivity of the film containing the fragrance tablet will allow sufficient fragrance to pass through the container apertures so that the consumer can detect the fragrance prior the purchase.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems, kits and methods, and specifically to a system, kit and method including a toothbrush having an open cavity that retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to one's teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

Further difficulties arise in that dispensers used for dispensing fluid materials have a tendency to weep after use due to pressure exerted on the fluid in the reservoir from the elevator.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with a fluid dispenser in a highly portable and convenient housing. Advantageously, such embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush that detachably retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care system includes fluid such as fluidic oral care materials, either active or non-active agents, that may include without limitation, whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other oral care materials. The dispenser can be detachably docked and stored at least partially within the handle of the toothbrush so that a portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush, or forms a proximal end of the toothbrush handle, to permit access to a user for easy removal and use of the dispenser. The dispenser can be completely removable from the toothbrush in certain embodiments so that the user can apply the fluid to his/her teeth with ease, and then reinsert the dispenser in the toothbrush for convenient storage. In certain embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component. The toothbrush can removably and non-fixedly secure the dispenser within the handle so that the dispenser can be repetitively removed and reinserted therein. In some embodiments, the dispenser may be adapted to be user-refillable for repeated use.

In one embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush, the dispenser comprising: a housing having a longitudinal axis and an internal reservoir for containing a fluid; a dispensing orifice in the housing for dispensing the fluid from the reservoir; a collar within the housing, the collar comprising an axial passageway and a cam surface, the collar being non-rotatable with respect to the housing; a reciprocator comprising an actuator, a drive screw extending through the axial passageway of the collar, and a cam surface, the reciprocator being rotatable with respect to the housing; a resilient member that axially biases the cam surface of the reciprocator and the cam surface of the collar into mating contact; an elevator forming an end wall of the reservoir, the elevator being non-rotatable with respect to the housing and threadily coupled to the drive screw; and wherein rotation of the actuator causes the elevator to (1) axially advance along the drive screw in a first axial direction due to relative rotation between the drive screw and the elevator, and (2) axially reciprocate due to relative rotation between the cam surface of the collar and the cam surface of the reciprocator.

In another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush, the dispenser comprising: a housing forming an internal cavity extending along a longitudinal axis; an elevator disposed within the internal cavity that hermetically separates the internal cavity into a reservoir for containing a fluid and a chamber, the elevator comprising an outer surface forming an end wall of the reservoir and an inner surface forming an end wall of the chamber, the elevator being non-rotatable with respect to the housing; a dispensing orifice in the housing for dispensing the fluid from the reservoir; an actuator; a drive screw in the chamber and operably coupled to the actuator, the drive screw and the actuator being rotatable with respect to the housing, wherein the drive screw does not penetrate through the outer surface of the elevator into the reservoir; and an extension member having a first end coupled to the elevator and a second end threadily coupled to the drive screw, the extension member being non-rotatable with respect to the housing; and wherein rotation of the actuator causes the elevator to axially advance along the drive screw in a first axial direction due to relative rotation between the drive screw and the extension member.

In yet another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush, the dispenser comprising: a housing having a longitudinal axis and an internal reservoir for containing a fluid; a dispensing orifice in the housing for dispensing the fluid from the reservoir; a first cam surface within the housing, the first cam surface being non-rotatable with respect to the housing; a reciprocator comprising an actuator, a drive screw, and a second cam surface, the reciprocator being rotatable with respect to the housing; a resilient member that axially biases the second cam surface and the cam surface of the collar into mating contact, wherein the mating contact between the first cam surface and the second cam surface prevents the reciprocator from being uncoupled from the housing; an elevator forming an end wall of the reservoir, the elevator being non-rotatable with respect to the housing and threadily coupled to the drive screw; wherein rotation of the actuator causes the elevator to (1) axially advance along the drive screw in a first axial direction due to relative rotation between the drive screw and the elevator, and (2) axially reciprocate due to relative rotation between the first cam surface and the second cam surface.

In still another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush, the dispenser comprising: a housing forming an internal cavity extending along a longitudinal axis; an elevator disposed within the internal cavity that hermetically separates the internal cavity into a reservoir for containing a fluid and a chamber, the elevator comprising an outer surface forming an end wall of the reservoir and an inner surface forming an end wall of the chamber, the elevator being non-rotatable with respect to the housing; a dispensing orifice in the housing for dispensing the fluid from the reservoir; an actuator; a drive screw in the chamber and operably coupled to the actuator, the drive screw and the actuator being rotatable with respect to the housing, wherein the drive screw does not penetrate through the outer surface of the elevator into the reservoir when the elevator is in a fully retracted position; and the elevator operbaly coupled to the drive screw so that rotation of the actuator causes the elevator to axially advance along the drive screw in a first axial direction due to relative rotation between the drive screw and the elevator.

In certain exemplary embodiments, any suitable fluid may be used with embodiments and methods described herein according to the present invention. Accordingly, the oral care treatment system may be any type of system including without limitation tooth whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection/control, and others. The invention is expressly not limited to any particular type of oral care system or oral care material, unless specifically claimed.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND

Antiperspirant or deodorant formulations have been developed with a range of different product forms. One of these is a so-called “stick” which is usually a bar of an apparently firm solid material held within a dispensing container and which retains its structural integrity and shape whilst being applied. When a portion of the stick is drawn across the skin surface, a film of the stick composition is transferred to the skin surface. Payout, of a deodorant stick, describes the weight lost to a surface from a typical application of the deodorant stick. This attribute and other rheological properties are considerations when developing new stick deodorant products. Therefore, a controlled method and device for measuring such properties is desirable.

BRIEF SUMMARY

The system includes at least one substrate positioned on an XYZ translational substrate bed. The system includes a sample holder for supporting a sample, wherein the sample holder and the sample are positioned perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed. The system further includes a force device placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder; the predetermined weight determines a contact force placed by the sample onto the substrate. The system also includes frictionless bearing table connected to the sample holder and a stationary frictionless bearing table positioned parallel to the XYZ translational substrate bed. The sample holder and the stationary frictionless bearing table are connected to a friction sensor. The system also includes a balance for obtaining a first substrate weight before movement of the XYZ translational substrate bed and a second substrate weight after movement of the XYZ translational substrate bed.

The system further includes a controller operably coupled to the moving substrate bed and the friction sensor and configured to execute a machine readable program code containing executable instructions.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring payout is disclosed. The method comprises positioning a substrate of pre-known weight on an XYZ translational substrate bed; supporting a sample in a sample holder, wherein the sample is perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed; placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder so that the sample and substrate form a contact point; first moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a first sweep speed in a first direction relative to the sample; second moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a second sweep speed in a second direction relative to the sample; conducting the first moving and the second moving for a predetermined number of cycle(s); obtaining a second substrate weight of the substrate after the predetermined number of cycles; and determining a payout value based on the first substrate weight and the second substrate weight.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring one or more of static friction and kinetic friction is provided. The method comprises: positioning a substrate of pre-known weight on an XYZ translational substrate bed; supporting a sample in a sample holder, wherein the sample is perpendicular to the XYZ translational substrate bed; placing a predetermined weight onto the sample holder so that the sample and substrate form a contact point; first moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a first sweep speed in a first direction relative to the sample; second moving the XYZ translational substrate bed at a second sweep speed in a second direction relative to the sample; conducting the first moving and the second moving for a predetermined number of cycle(s); during the first moving step and the second moving step, measuring one or more friction values at the contact point; analyzing one or more friction values generated at the sample contact point during the first moving step and the second moving step; and determining one or more of a static friction value and a kinetic friction value based on the one or more friction values.

In an embodiment of the present invention, a method for measuring flakeoff is provided. The method comprises: providing a wool sample of a predetermined size; applying an initial weight of a material to the wool sample; attaching a first end of the wool to a stationary holder and a second end to a movable substrate bed; a stretching step comprising moving the movable substrate bed a predetermined distance and returning and then moving it to an opposite direction for the same predetermined distance and returning for 1 stretch; repeating the stretch step for a predetermined number of stretches; measuring the weight of the wool sample and material after the predetermined number of stretches; determining a weight loss of material from the wool sample as measured by an amount of material lost from the sample divided by the initial weight of material after the predetermined number of stretches.

In each of the above methods, the methods are conducted on the above described system.

"CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. 371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/061703, filed 22 Dec. 2010, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Nos. 61/289,430, filed on 23 Dec. 2009, and 61/394,113, filed 18 Oct. 2010, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

Cleansing bars have historically been made from salts of fatty acids (soaps). They can also be made from surfactants (syndet bars), or they can be made from a combination of soaps and surfactants (combars). Typically, the soaps and/or surfactants have been the dominate ingredient in cleansing bars.

As the cost of raw materials increases, such as oil, the cost of soaps and surfactants increase. With increasing costs, the profitability of cleansing bars decreases. It would be desirable to replace the high cost materials with lower cost materials and still deliver a desired level of cleaning and lathering.

Attempts have been made to use clay and talc in bars, but just adding in talc and/or clay does not result in acceptable bars. For example, see Table 1 in WO2006/094586A1 in which talc and/or clay were used to make bars. The bars made from these compositions had no structural integrity or were too brittle.

While it would be desirable to use clay and/or talc in the manufacture of a cleansing bar, additional design is needed to develop a bar with commercially desirable properties for structural integrity, lathering, cracking, texture, and use-up rate.

SUMMARY

A cleansing bar comprising at least one member chosen from clay and talc, wherein a total amount of clay and talc is present in an amount that is greater than any other material in the cleansing bar, at least one cleanser chosen from soap and surfactant, and a binder present in an amount to structure the cleansing bar into a bar.

Also, a method of making the cleansing bar comprising mixing the clay and/or talc with the binder before mixing in the cleansing agent.

Also, a method of removing bacteria from skin comprising washing skin with the cleansing bar.

Also, a method of inhibiting bacterial growth on skin comprising washing skin with the cleansing bar.

"FIELD OF INVENTION

The present invention relates to oral care implements, and more particularly to a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements.

BACKGROUND

Oral care implements such as toothbrushes are typically used in conjunction with a dentifrice for cleansing the teeth and/or soft tissue in the oral cavity. The dentifrice or similar oral care product may contain one or more ingredients which, when administered with a toothbrush generally via a brushing action, provide an oral health benefit to the user such as removing plaque and debris from the surface of the teeth and/or gums, polishing and whitening the teeth, protecting from sensitivity, reducing oral surface bacteria populations, and others.

Conventional toothbrush heads generally contain a plurality of tooth cleaning elements such as bristles which temporarily support the dentifrice during its application to the teeth and/or gums. By design, such bristles usually are formed into tufts containing numerous individual bristle strands (typically made of nylon or another polymer) and are primarily adapted for removing debris. These general purpose bristles are not optimized for polishing and removing stains from tooth surfaces or applying an oral care material to decrease sensitivity, particularly when used with a dentifrice containing, anti-sensitivity, whitening and polishing agents. The tips of the individual bristle strands make less than ideal surface area contact with tooth surfaces to achieve the optimum type of polishing and or filling action desired to effectively reduce sensitivity, remove stains, and polish and whiten the teeth.

An improved toothbrush head with elements for filling, polishing and whitening the teeth is therefore desired.

SUMMARY

An oral care implement such as a toothbrush according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of tooth cleaning elements including one or more polishing units configured and adapted to provide enhanced cleaning, filling, polishing, and whitening of the teeth. In preferred embodiments, the polishing units include elastomeric polishing elements having a polishing head and preferably a bristle element disposed at least partially inside the polishing element. At least one, but preferably at least two polishing units are disposed among a field of bristle elements formed of one or more bristle tufts of various configuration as described herein that are disposed on the head of the toothbrush.

According to one embodiment, a toothbrush for enhanced cleaning, filling, polishing and whitening of the teeth includes a toothbrush head defining a longitudinal axis and a plurality of tooth cleaning elements supported by the toothbrush head. The tooth cleaning elements include at least one tooth polishing unit having a polishing element including a supporting base and a broadened flexible tooth polishing head extending angularly outwards from the base and defining a polishing surface. In some embodiments, the polishing unit is comprised of a plurality of individual inverted L-shaped polishing members each collectively defining part of the supporting base and the polishing head of the polishing unit. A bristle element may be disposed at least partially inside the polishing unit and preferably between at least two of the individual polishing members. In one exemplary embodiment, the bristle element may have a Y-shape as further described herein.

According to another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a toothbrush head defining a longitudinal axis and a plurality of tooth cleaning elements supported by the head. The tooth cleaning elements may include at least one tooth polishing unit including an elastomeric element and a bristle element disposed at least partially inside the elastomeric element. The elastomeric element preferably has a broadened or flattened/planar flexible tooth polishing head disposed angularly to the bristle element. The polishing head may be supported by and adjoined to a vertical supporting base attached to the toothbrush head. In preferred embodiments, the polishing head is angularly disposed with respect to the supporting base. The elastomeric element in exemplary embodiments has a generally mushroom or umbrella shape with the supporting base being narrower in width than the polishing head.

According to another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a head defining a longitudinal axis and a front brushing side, and a plurality of bristle elements attached to the front brushing side of the head. The toothbrush further includes a polishing unit attached to the front brushing side of the head that may be comprised of a plurality of individual elastomeric polishing members. Each polishing member preferably has a supporting shaft attached to the front brushing side of the toothbrush head and an adjoining flattened polishing head extending angularly from the supporting shaft. In some embodiments, the polishing heads are wedge-shaped when viewed in a horizontal plane. The wedge-shaped polishing heads each define a sector of a circle in an exemplary embodiment and are arranged to collectively form a circular polishing surface. In one embodiment, at least one bristle element is disposed between at least one pair of polishing members. In another embodiment, a Y-shaped bristle element may be interspersed between the polishing members.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present application relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush having an oral care material located within the head is rapidly released upon use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present application solves one or more of the problems of the related art by providing an oral care implement, comprising a handle and a head connected to one end of the handle. The head has at least one cleaning element. The head has at least one oral care dispenser. The oral care dispenser is configured to release an oral care material within about five seconds when exposed to water at a temperature of about 35° C. to about 40° C.

In one embodiment a waterless toothbrush is provided having a rupturable dispenser containing an oral care material and being connected in the bristle portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the oral care material to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening, to deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening, between teeth cleaning, and breath freshening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical disposable or limited use toothbrush.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush may have (1) tooth surface cleaning provided by the toothbrush bristles or other cleaning elements and the oral care material in the rupturable dispenser; (2) between teeth cleaning provided by the toothpick; and (3) breath freshening provided by the oral care material in the rupturable dispenser.

In some embodiments, an oral care toothbrush may comprise a handle having an oral care head mounted to one end of the handle with an oral care accessory mounted to an opposite end of the handle. A plurality of oral care elements such as cleaning/massage elements, which could be bristles, extending outwardly from the outer surface of the head. The head may also include one or more structures for dispensing oral care material in the oral care field of the head.

In some embodiments, the oral care toothbrush may be characterized by its small size and light weight so that it is readily adaptable for travel use. The oral care toothbrush may be capable of having multiple functions by including an accessory as part of the toothbrush such as a toothpick, dental floss or tongue cleaner.

In some embodiments, the oral care toothbrush may include a toothpick formed at one end of the handle; and a head connected at another end of said handle, said head having a bristle block that includes a plurality of bristles and retains a gel capsule therein, the gel capsule containing a mouth care solution. In further embodiments, the gel capsule can be replaced by a quantity of toothpowder, toothpaste or a tooth cleaning gel dentifrice, to provide the cleaning benefits of the dentifrice within the rupturable dispenser.

In some embodiments, a subset of bristles in the toothbrush head may include retaining members that hold the capsule in place. The retaining members may extend out of the head's bristle block, and may be curved inward to hold the capsule. The retaining members may be made of the same material as the other bristles, and may be shorter and wider than the bristles to provide greater support and rigidity.

Further features and options will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only.

Among the advantages of some embodiments of the toothbrushes disclosed herein are that the size and configuration of the toothbrush allows discreet hygienic use, such as no fingers in the mouth, adapting it to be readily used in public areas. Such uses could be done without the need for a sink or fountain or other source of water.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to blow molded polyester containers that have an exterior layer of a thermoplastic of a different functionality, such as color, and in particular to polyester containers where the exterior layer has a varied thickness which results in an exterior layer with a color gradient.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

It is important for a product to be well presented on a store shelf. For many products this will involve the package for the product. This is particularly the case for products that must be within a container on the store shelf. This includes liquid, gel, viscous, and powder products. Since such products usually will not be clearly seen at the time of purchase the decision to purchase a product will depend on the product presentation. This includes the container design, coloration, and the container graphics. The present invention is directed to the design and the coloration of the container. Many of the containers used today are thermoplastic containers, such as polyester containers that are blow molded from preforms. The preform can be clear or it can have a color. It is in the shape of an elongated tube and usually will have threads on an upper open end. The upper end will be essentially the same on the container as on the preform. In blow molding to a container the preform is heated to soften the thermoplastic so that it can flow during the stretch and blowing operations. The preform is stretch blow molded in a mold where the mold cavity has the negative of the exterior shape of the container that is being stretch blow molded. A rod stretches the preform longitudinally while the preform is being blown primarily laterally with a high pressure gas. The blow molded container will have the color of the preform and the shape of the mold cavity.

In the usual ways of making a thermoplastic based container, such as a polyester based container, the container can be clear or have a particular color. It will be clear or be the single color of the preform. The full preform, including the threaded neck will be of the same color. The problem then is how to efficiently improve the aesthetic appearance of containers. Using the processes of the present invention preforms and containers can be produced having an exterior color gradient, as well as a plurality of colors arrayed longitudinally around the container. These plurality of colors also can be in the form of color gradients. This is accomplished by an over molded thermoplastic layer over part or most of the preform and container. In addition, the containers can have varied colors through color differentiation and color matching. In color differentiation the preform can be of a first color and the over molded thermoplastic layer a different color with each being distinctly different colors. In color matching the preform will be of a first color and the over molded layer a complimentary color so that there can be perceived a third color by light passing through the two layers. Color matching will occur when the over mold layer has a thickness gradient over a wall of the container. This will be more apparent in a container blow molded from a preform where the over molded layer is of a decreasing thickness (gradient) allowing for the color of the container to be seen mixing with the color of the over molded layer and producing a tint of a third color. As an example a first color preform and a second color over molded layer will give each of these colors where the other color is visually absent and a varying blend in areas where there is a gradient in the thickness of the over-mold layer so that light is reflected from both colors. Thus a blue container will give a blue at one end where there is no over mold layer and green at the other end where solely an over-mold green layer is visually perceptive, with a blend of the two colors between each end. This will provide a great number of ways to decorate a container. The container can further be decorated by utilizing the color of the product within the container.

The prior art is directed to forming polyester preforms and coating these preforms with a coating of a barrier material. These will be moisture and/or gas barrier materials. The preforms then are blow molded by conventional processes and equipment to form the desired container. These usually are beverage containers. Such preforms and containers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,391,408; 6,808,820 and 6,939,591. The objective in these patents is to produce containers with enhanced barrier properties. There is no disclosure as to how to significantly improve the aesthetic appearance of the containers as well as various physical properties. The over molding of polyester preforms and containers with elastomers is set out in my related application U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/307,700, filed Feb. 17, 2007.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to blow molded containers having a container body layer and an over molded layer, the blow molded containers having a container body and a container dispensing exit, at least a portion of the container body having a thermoplastic container body layer and a thermoplastic over molded layer, the container body layer being transparent or a first color and the over molded layer being of a second color. The container has a first end and a second end, the container dispensing exit on the first end and a container base on the second end. There can be a plurality of over molded layers on the container body layer. A thickness gradient of the over-molded layer(s) can vary from the first end to the second end or from the second end to the first end. In one embodiment the thickness gradient of the over molded layer is greater at the second end than at the first end, the color of the container body being darker at the second end than at the first end, and in a second embodiment the over molded layer thickness gradient is greater at the first end than at the second end, the color of the container body being darker at the first end than at the second end. This will yield a visual color gradient from one end to the other end.

The first color and the second color can be complementary colors where in a blend of the colors there is yielded a third color. The colors are blended when the thickness of the over molded layer is sufficiently thin that light passes through the container body layer and the over molded layer. The first and/or the second color can be a plurality of colors in a set pattern.

A preform for making the blow molded containers has a first end and a second end, the first end being open and forms the dispensing exit of the blow molded container and the second end being closed and forms the base of the container, the preform having a preform body layer and a preform over molded layer, the preform body layer being essentially transparent or of a first color and the preform over molded layer being of a second color. There can be multiple preform over molded layers. The thickness of the preform over molded layer(s) can vary from the first end to the second end. The thickness of the over molded layer(s) in one embodiment is greater at the second end than at the first end, the color of the preform being darker at the second end than at the first end, and in another embodiment is greater at the first end than at the second end, the color of the preform being darker at the first end than at the second end. When there is a plurality of over molded layers one or more can be of a constant thickness or a gradient thickness.

The blow molded container and the preform have a body layer which is a thermoplastic layer of the container and the over molded layer is a thermoplastic layer, preferably a non-elastomeric thermoplastic layer. The preform thermoplastic is selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate and polyethylene naphthalate. The over molded layer is selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate, polybutylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, polyethylene polymers, polyethylene copolymers, polypropylene polymers, polypropylene copolymers and vinyl copolymers.

The color of the body layer and the color of the over molded layer will blend in the areas of the preform and the container where the over molded layer has a thickness to allow the color of the body layer to be perceived. Depending on the thickness of this over molded layer the blended color will vary with the thickness of the over molded layer. In the embodiment where the over molded layer is thick at one end and absent at the other end with a transition from thickness to an absence of the over molded layer. The preform and the blow molded container will have the color at the over molded layer at the one end and the color of the container body layer at the other end. Between the one end and the other end there will be a blended color which will produce various shades of a third color. The blow molded container will have a unique and decorative appearance over the usual opaque or transparent container. In a further embodiment the product in the container may be of a color which can be perceived through the container body layer and the over molded layer. Depending on the depth of the body layer color and the depth of the over molded layer color, the product color can be a part of the color blend at parts of the container where the color of the product can be perceived through the container body layer and the over molded layer. Where the container body layer is substantially transparent (means that the product in the container can be visually perceived through the container wall) the color of the product will be the blending color with the over mold layer(s) in the areas where the color of the product can be perceived. Where the over mold layer is of a gradient form the color of the product will be perceived in the area of decreased thickness of the over molded layer(s). The product color will be solely perceived in the areas where there are no over mold layers.

The over molded layer can be on all or a part of the body layer of the preform and of the container blow molded from this preform. In addition the over molded layer can be in a multiple longitudinally striped pattern on the body layer with the stripes being of varying colors. Each of these stripes can have a thickness from the one end to the other end, and this can vary from stripe to stripe. The net result is a wide range of possible color variations for the container which will enhance its aesthetic appearance on the store shelf and later in the residence of the purchaser.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Abrasives are often used to clean and/or polish hard surfaces, such as teeth, household fixtures and goods, and the like. Further, such abrasives can also be used in conjunction with personal care compositions, for example as exfoliation products for skin and nails. Generally, the particle size, crystallinity, hardness, and structure, as well as other factors determine whether certain abrasives are more suitable for cleaning or polishing of a surface. The selection of abrasives for any purpose likewise accounts for the surface properties and degree of accompanying mechanical force. Cleaning abrasives are typically used to debride debris, impurities, and stains from a surface. Polishing abrasives create a smooth, glossy appearance on the target surface and can provide further stain removal.

To maximize the effectiveness of a composition that polishes, and preferably also cleans, it is desirable to have increasingly finer or smaller particles contact a surface during processing to provide polishing, also referred to as lapping. Maximizing contact of the particles with the surface provides more efficacious cleaning and/or polishing, particularly when the sequence and duration of contact of different abrasives can be controlled. Further, controlling the physical orientation of polishing particles with respect to the surface is desirable to enhance efficacy of the abrasives. However, there are significant challenges to using both cleaning and polishing abrasives in a single product to achieve the desired effect. Compatibilizing different abrasives in a single carrier can pose difficulties. Additionally, staging release of different species of abrasives, particularly when they are combined in a single product, poses a challenge. Thus, compositions and methods that improve the cleaning and/or polishing of a target surface are desirable.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In various embodiments, an oral composition is provided that comprises a first abrasive, a film comprising a second abrasive, and a carrier.

In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a method of cleaning or polishing a target surface comprising:

contacting the surface with a composition comprising a first abrasive, a film comprising a second abrasive, and a carrier;

disintegrating at least a portion of the film to expose the second abrasive; and

contacting the surface with the second abrasive.

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method of cleaning or polishing a target surface with a controlled release composition comprising a first abrasive and a second abrasive is provided. The method comprises:

contacting the first abrasive with the surface; and

subsequently contacting the second abrasive with the surface

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method of cleaning or polishing an oral surface comprising:

introducing an oral composition into an oral cavity that comprises a film comprising a polishing abrasive into an oral cavity; and

contacting the film with an oral surface and saliva, wherein during the contacting the film disintegrates into a plurality of successively smaller film fragments, and wherein the contacting of the film with the oral surface polishes the oral surface.

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a composition for cleaning and/or polishing a target surface comprising:

a carrier comprising a cleaning abrasive and a polishing abrasive, wherein the polishing abrasive is activated for polishing subsequent to exposure to the surface or a solvent.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention encompasses non-aqueous dentifrice compositions containing a bioacceptable and bioactive glass with improved mouth-feel, foam, and product stability. More particularly, the invention encompasses non-aqueous compositions including combinations including carrageenan and/or carboxymethylcellulose gums, glycerin, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymers, and a bioactive glass and methods of use the compositions in an oral care product, for example, a whitening toothpaste, for hypersensitive teeth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human tooth enamel—consisting primarily of hydroxycarbonate apatite, a crystalline calcium phosphate mineral—naturally undergoes a process of demineralization. Exposure of the enamel to saliva and food leaches minerals from teeth over time and eventually may lead to an increased susceptibility to decay, dentin hypersensitivity, incipient caries, and even carious dentin demineralization.

Bioactive glasses have demonstrated an ability to remineralize teeth and reduce dentin hypersensitivity by reacting with body fluids in the oral cavity to immediately and continuously release calcium and phosphate ions from core silica particles that then crystallize into a stable hydroxycarbonate apatite layer. This crystalline layer is deposited onto and into dentin tubules and effectively both remineralizes teeth and reduces dentin hypersensitivity immediately and in the long term.

A dentifrice composition containing bioactive glass that is suitable for routine daily use to counteract the natural demineralization process is therefore desirable. However, conventional dentifrice compositions including bioactive glass are unsuitable for regular use as for example, toothpastes, because these compositions are water-based and the calcium ions released by the bioactive glass reacts and crosslink with water molecules to form unacceptably thick pastes. The inventors have developed non-aqueous formulations that overcome the difficulty in incorporating conventional gums that provide acceptable mouth-feel and prevent component separation in toothpastes. Accordingly, the invention encompasses non-aqueous dentifrice compositions containing a bioacceptable and bioactive glass that is suitable for routine, regular use and that provides acceptable mouth-feel, foam, and product stability.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one embodiment, the invention encompasses non-aqueous dentifrice compositions including: at least one gum selected from the group consisting of carrageenan and carboxymethylcellulose gums; at least one humectant; and a bioacceptable and bioactive glass. Such non-aqueous compositions may then suitably contain other components that are unstable or incompatible with an aqueous environment.

In another embodiment, the invention encompasses non-aqueous dentifrice composition including: from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of at least one gum selected from the group consisting of carrageenan and carboxymethylcellulose gums; from 20.0 wt. % to 80.0 wt. % of at least one humectant; from 1.0 wt. % to 20.0 wt. % of a bioacceptable and bioactive glass; from 1.0 wt. % to 30.0 wt. % of at least one surfactant; from 0.01 wt. % to 10.0 wt. % of a potassium salt; from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of a fluoride salt; and from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of a whitening agent.

In another embodiment, the invention encompasses methods of treating the oral cavity, for example, hypersensitive teeth, including contacting the teeth in a subject in need thereof with a non-aqueous dentifrice composition, wherein the dentifrice composition includes: from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of at least one gum selected from the group consisting of carrageenan and carboxymethylcellulose gums; from 20.0 wt. % to 80.0 wt. % of at least one humectant; from 1.0 wt. % to 20.0 wt. % of a bioacceptable and bioactive glass; from 1.0 wt. % to 30.0 wt. % of at least one surfactant; from 0.01 wt. % to 10.0 wt. % of a potassium salt; from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of a fluoride salt; and from 0.01 wt. % to 5.0 wt. % of a whitening agent.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a vibrating toothbrush generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush having vibrations that are isolated in the head and having reduced transmissions to the handle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Power toothbrushes generally comprise a power source, a motor and a powered element that is driven by the motor. In one type of power toothbrush, a power toothbrush head is provided with movable cleaning elements that are usually driven laterally, rotationally or in an oscillating manner by a motor located in the handle. The motor generates a vibration that is absorbed directly by the hands of the user. However, such vibration is effectively a byproduct of the motor operation and is usually not intended to enhance the effectiveness of the movable cleaning elements. Instead, the vibration provides a tactile sensation to the user and generally creates a perceived feeling of increased cleaning, effectiveness.

Another type of power toothbrush relies primarily on vibrations to produce a cleaning operation. These are normally referred to as “sonic”-type brushes because the vibrations generated to achieve a high cleaning efficacy are generally of a frequency of 20-20,000 Hz that can be perceived by the human ear as a “buzz.” However, the combination of this sonic noise and the high-frequency vibration felt on one's teeth create a tactile sensation of highly increased effectiveness. To achieve the greatest cleaning, it is preferable to situate the vibration-generation device as close to the toothbrush head as possible so as to focus the vibratory energy near the site of greatest cleaning, and not along the handle.

In some prior art sonic-type brushes, elastomeric regions are provided between the motor and the handle to dampen the vibrations felt in the handle. However, such regions tend to decrease the structural strength of the neck and create localized weaknesses in the neck material that could subject the toothbrush to breakage or cause the toothbrush to fail cyclic fatigue tests. Dampening regions are also noticed in other vibrating-type toothbrushes near the junction of the neck and the handle, usually in the form of an elastomeric section or sections of varying, configurations. However, again, such sections create structural weaknesses at a location that usually receives a significant amount of stress during use.

There is a need, therefore, to provide a vibration-powered toothbrush having cleaning vibrations that are directed toward or isolated in the head region and reduced in the handle region, and that do not create weakened areas that subject the toothbrush to breakage and cyclic fatigue.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A vibrating toothbrush is provided, with vibration-isolating zones that substantially isolate vibrations in the head and reduce vibrations transmitted to the handle, without sacrificing structural integrity. Such vibration-isolating zones may generally comprise neck material that is reduced in cross-section, thinned, replaced by elastic or dampening material, or removed altogether to create transmission-inhibiting voids. Such zones may be further supported by the housing of the vibratory element to maintain the structural integrity around the zones.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with a cavitation system. Individuals exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth or perform interdental cleaning of their teeth. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a vibratory system that may produce cavitation in oral fluid.

In one aspect, an oral care implement generates cavitation within the oral cavity. One or more cavitation cleaning elements may be located in the head area of the oral care implement. The cavitation cleaning element vibrates at a frequency that produces cavitation of fluids within the oral cavity.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having cleaning elements and an elastomeric cavitation cleaning element; and a body for gripping the implement.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having cleaning elements and a vibratory cleaning element configured to vibratory release an oral care substance from a container; and a body for gripping the implement.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and, more particularly, to oral care implements which have a moisture degradable dispenser containing an oral care material.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, people either forget their toothbrushes when traveling or do not carry their toothbrushes outside of the home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush, a dentifrice and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach tends to be economically inefficient due to added manufacturing costs. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale. Furthermore, these toothbrushes require water in order for the toothpaste to have maximum effectiveness and for the user to clean up after a tooth brushing session.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement that comprises a dispenser containing an oral care material. The dispenser is designed to degrade when subjected to a user's saliva so that the oral care material is released into the oral cavity of the user. While designing the dispenser to degrade when subjected to saliva allows the inventive oral care implement to be used without water, the dispenser will also have a tendency to degrade prematurely if accidentally subjected to water or to a high humidity environment, thereby resulting in the oral care implement being ruined for its intended purpose. Thus, according to the present invention, the oral care implement further comprises a cap that creates an air-tight chamber between a head of the oral care implement and an inner surface of the cap in which the dispenser is located.

In one aspect, the invention is an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a face of the head; a dispenser containing an oral care material, the dispenser being degradable when subjected to moisture; a removable cap attached to the head such that an inner surface of the cap and a portion of the head forms an air-tight chamber; and wherein the dispenser is disposed within the air-tight chamber.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a face of the head; a dispenser containing an oral care material, the dispenser being degradable when subjected to moisture; a removable cap attached to the head such that an inner surface of the cap and a portion of the head forms an air-tight chamber, the air-tight chamber containing a low humidity atmosphere; and wherein the dispenser is disposed within the low humidity atmosphere of the air-tight chamber.

In a further aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a face of the head; a dispenser containing an oral care material disposed on the head; a removable cap attached to the head and covering the dispenser; and wherein the dispenser and the cap are surrounded by the plurality of tooth cleaning elements.

In a yet another aspect, the invention can be a method of assembling an oral care implement for distribution comprising: providing an oral care implement comprising a handle and a head connected to the handle and a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a face of the head; providing a dispenser containing an oral care material on the head of the oral care implement, the dispenser being degradable when subjected to moisture; and attaching a removable cap to the head in a low humidity atmosphere such that an inner surface of the cap and a portion of the head forms an air-tight chamber, the air-tight chamber filled with the low humidity atmosphere and the dispenser disposed within the air-tight chamber.

In a yet further aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle, the head comprising at least one tooth cleaning element extending from a face of the head; a dispenser containing an oral care material positioned on the head, the dispenser being degradable when subjected to moisture; a removable barrier attached to the head so as to create a chamber between an inner surface of the removable barrier and a portion of the head, the removable barrier being constructed of a moisture impermeable material; and wherein the dispenser is disposed within the chamber.

In an even further aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle, the head comprising at least one tooth cleaning element extending from a face of the head; the at least one tooth cleaning element comprising an oral care material; a removable barrier attached to the head so as to create a chamber between an inner surface of the removable barrier and a portion of the head, the removable barrier being constructed of a moisture impermeable material; and wherein the at least one tooth cleaning element is disposed within the chamber.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to multi-component toothbrushes having enhanced visual and/or scenting effects resulting from the properties (e.g., transparency) and structural configuration (e.g., use of a base component having projections) of the toothbrush components.

Toothbrushes are often constructed from multiple components having dissimilar properties in terms of hardness, texture, color, etc. to provide an overall product possessing a number of desired features, such as ease of gripping, good bending/flexibility characteristics, and high durability. However, the domain of possible combinations of components which can be combined using straightforward manufacturing techniques is limited by component compatibility, which in turn depends upon the individual component compositions. Thus, while the incorporation of aesthetic features (e.g., three-dimensional effects) and even scenting agents in toothbrushes may be desired to improve product appeal to the user, the components required to obtain these properties often cannot be easily combined in an efficient and/or low-cost manner. For example, combining transparent and opaque plastics can require the use of chemical adhesives or bonding agents for acceptable adherence of these components.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Aspects of the invention relate to toothbrushes constructed of at least two components such as injection molded plastics having distinct optical properties (e.g., transparency). In representative embodiments, the components are chemically compatible such that they can be acceptably adhered to one other without an adhesive.

The components combine to provide visual effects such as the appearance of three-dimensional features (e.g., projections) in a base component at varying depths beneath an overlying (or covering) transparent or partially transparent second component. For example, if the second component is only partially transparent, then its use to cover projection surfaces of a base component at varying thicknesses will result in varying degrees of visibility of these surfaces. Projection surfaces covered by a relatively thick layer of partially transparent plastic component may be only faintly visible compared to projection surfaces covered by a relatively thin layer (or otherwise not covered at all, i.e., protruding through the partially transparent plastic component). If desired, underlying surfaces of the base component may be essentially completely obscured, causing the projection surfaces to appear suspended in the partially transparent second component.

In some embodiments, the second components or other toothbrush components may contain scenting agents. In any event, it will be appreciated from the present disclosure how varying component thicknesses and scenting concentrations can be used to vary and control the release of scenting agent from different portions of the toothbrush surface exterior (e.g., portions of the handle).

Aspects of the invention therefore relate to a toothbrush comprising a base component comprising an outer surface, a gripping region and an oral engaging region; a second component covering at least a portion of said base component in said gripping region, wherein said base component comprises a plurality of cutouts and at least one projection in said gripping region, wherein said first component is opaque and said second component is at least partially transparent, wherein said at least one projection is oval in shape and protrudes through said second component so that a surface of said at least one projection is substantially flush with said outer surface of said base component.

Further aspects of the invention relate to a toothbrush, as discussed above, comprising a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region and a second component covering a portion of the base component in the gripping region. The base component and the second component are chemically compatible, such that the components can adhere to a satisfactory degree without the use of a chemical adhesive, bonding agent, or even mechanical interlocking of the components.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following Detailed Description.

"BACKGROUND

Periodontal disease is characterized, in part, by abnormal and excessive degradation of the periodontal organic matrix. This matrix includes the gingiva, periodontal ligament, cementum and alveolar bone. These events result in the clinical manifestation of periodontitis, including gingival recession, pocket formation, loss of attachment, and eventual tooth loss. Many different inflammatory mediators are produced by periodontal tissues affected by periodontal disease. Some of these mediators appear to play a central role in the destructive processes observed in cases of periodontal diseases, which has led some investigators to examine the possibility of using certain inflammatory mediators as biomarkers for progressive lesions (Sorsa, T. et al. Arch. Oral. Biol. 35: 193S-196S, 1990: Page, R. C., J. Periodont. Res. 26: 230-242, 1991).

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

The present application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/044349, filed May 18, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention encompasses oral care compositions including a polyguanidine compound distributed in an orally acceptable carrier. The invention also encompasses methods for preparing oral compositions containing a polyguanidine compound and methods of use thereof. Methods for targeting an active ingredient to oral epithelial tissues, depositing a bacteriostatic or bacteriocidal material on oral surfaces, retarding or preventing dental caries, treating or preventing dentinal sensitivity, plugging dentinal tubules, treating a carious lesion, calcifying an exposed tooth pulp, and calcifying the base or all of a pit or fissure in a tooth, and the like, are also encompassed by the invention, which include delivering a therapeutically effective amount of an oral composition including a polyguanidine compound into the oral cavity.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Periodontal disease and caries are the most prevalent dental problems. Aside from affecting oral tissues, periodontal disease has also been associated with various systemic diseases. Gingivitis, the mild form of the disease, is characterized by host tissue inflammation and bacterial plaque accumulation around the gingival margin. Treatment of gingivitis by improved oral hygiene practices can significantly reverse the disease condition. However, left untreated, gingivitis can lead to the more serious and irreversible periodontitis, which involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth, and if left untreated, can lead to the loosening and subsequent loss of teeth.

Caries is among the most infectious dental diseases and may result in demineralization and loss of enamel, dentine, and cementum. Untreated, bacterial plaques causing caries may also lead to dentinal hypersensitivity and pain, and subsequent loss of teeth. Acids produced as end-products of the bacterial degradation of fermentable carbohydrates dissolve hydroxyapatite, a calcium phosphate mineral that comprises most of the mineral of the enamel, dentine, and cementum. Acidic agents, including certain foods and oral personal care products may also cause tooth demineralization. Among the latter are many of the commercially available mouthwashes and abrasive toothpastes.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention encompasses compositions including polyamine-based materials, which form polyguanidine compounds that are useful for their antimicrobial, anticaries, and muccoadhesive properties. Accordingly, the invention encompasses polyguanidine compounds that include active ingredients with antimicrobial and acid neutralizing properties to target bacterial plaques associated with, for example, periodontal disease and caries on oral cavities.

FIELD

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems, kits and methods, and specifically to a system, kit and method including a toothbrush having an open cavity that retains a removable dispenser containing an oral care agent.

BACKGROUND

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to ones teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

SUMMARY

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with an oral care product or agent dispenser in a highly portable housing. Advantageously, such embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush having an open cavity in its handle that retains a removable dispenser containing an oral care agent reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care system includes oral care agents, either active or non-active, that may include without limitation whitening, enamel protection, sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other agents. The dispenser is detachably docked and stored at least partially within the handle of the toothbrush so that a gripping portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush for access to a user permitting easy removal and use of the dispenser. The dispenser is completely removable from the toothbrush so that the user can apply the oral care agent to his/her teeth with ease, and then reinsert the dispenser in the toothbrush for convenient storage. In preferred embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component. The toothbrush removably and non-fixedly secures the dispenser within the handle so that the dispenser can be repetitively removed and reinserted therein. In some embodiments, the dispenser may be adapted to be user-refillable for repeated use.

According to one exemplary embodiment, an oral care system according to the present invention includes a toothbrush having a handle with a removable portion that defines and incorporates a hand held dispenser adapted to contain and dispense an oral care agent. The removable portion of the handle may comprise a majority of the handle including portions of the lateral sides and bottom of the handle in some embodiments. The dispenser includes an applicator that dispenses the oral care agent to a target surface in the oral cavity of a user.

According to another embodiment, the alternative oral care system includes a toothbrush including: a handle defining a longitudinal axis and having a proximal end, a distal end, and a top portion; a head connected to the distal end of the handle; and a dispenser including: a longitudinally elongated housing having a distal end with an applicator therein and an opposite proximal end; and a reservoir disposed in the housing for holding an oral care agent, the reservoir being in fluid communication with the dispenser. The dispenser is removably attached to the top portion of the toothbrush handle and may be detached to apply the oral care agent to a target surface in the oral cavity of a user.

According to another embodiment, an oral care system includes: a toothbrush including a handle for gripping defining a longitudinal axis and having a proximal end, a distal end, and top portion fixedly attached to the distal end of the handle and extending rearward to the proximal end; a neck attached to the distal end of the handle; a head connected to the neck and having a plurality of tooth engaging elements; and a user removable portion of the handle defining an oral care agent dispenser. The dispenser includes: a longitudinally elongated housing having a distal end with an applicator therein and a proximal end; a reservoir disposed in the housing for holding the oral care agent, the reservoir being in fluid communication with the dispenser. The dispenser is removably attached to the top portion of the toothbrush handle and movable from a storage state being mounted in the handle to an application state being completely dismounted from the handle for dispensing the oral care agent into an oral cavity of the user.

A method is provided for dispensing and applying the oral care agent to a surface in the oral cavity of a user. In one embodiment, the method includes: providing a toothbrush having a handle and a detachable oral care agent dispenser supported by the handle, the dispenser including a reservoir containing an oral care agent and an applicator on a distal end in fluid communication with the reservoir; pivoting a proximal portion of the dispenser opposite the applicator in a transverse direction outwards from the handle; axially withdrawing the applicator from an enclosed sheath portion of the handle; completely removing the dispenser from the handle; and applying the oral care agent to an oral surface using the dispenser.

In preferred exemplary embodiments, any suitable oral care agent may be used with embodiments and methods described herein according to the present invention. Accordingly, the oral care treatment system may be any type of system including without limitation tooth whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection/control, and others. The invention is expressly not limited to any particular type of oral care system or oral care agent, unless specifically claimed.

FIELD

The present invention relates to oral care implements, and more particularly to a toothbrush with tooth cleaning elements.

BACKGROUND

Oral care implements such as toothbrushes are typically used in conjunction with a dentifrice for cleansing the teeth and/or soft tissue in the oral cavity. The dentifrice or similar oral care product may contain one or more active ingredients which when administered with a toothbrush generally via a brushing action provide an oral health benefit to the user such as removing plaque and debris from the surface of the teeth and/or gums, polishing and whitening the teeth, reducing oral surface bacteria populations, and others.

Conventional toothbrush heads generally contain a plurality of tooth cleaning elements such as bristles which temporarily support the dentifrice during its application to the teeth and/or gums. By design, such bristles usually are formed into tufts containing numerous individual bristle strands (typically made of nylon or another polymer) and are primarily adapted for removing debris. These general purpose bristles are not optimized for polishing and removing stains from tooth surfaces particularly when used with a dentifrice containing whitening and polishing agents. The tips of the individual bristle strands make less than ideal surface area contact with tooth surfaces to achieve the optimum type of polishing action desired to effectively remove stains, and polish and whiten the teeth.

Oral treatment dentifrices such as toothpaste are available in wide variety of formulations including tarter removal/control, whitening, sensitive teeth, enamel protection, and others. In order for the user to obtain maximum benefit from such products, the dentifrice should preferably remain in contact with the teeth during brushing. However, the dentifrice typically migrates either into the mouth of the user from the toothbrush bristles which support the dentifrice, or is forced downwards in between and towards the base of the bristles thereby minimizing the effectiveness of the dentifrice.

A toothbrush head which better supports the dentifrice for application to the teeth during brushing is therefore desired.

SUMMARY

An oral care implement such as a toothbrush according to one embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of tooth cleaning elements including bristle elements and preferably one or more tooth polishing units configured and adapted to provide enhanced cleaning, polishing, and whitening of the teeth. The polishing unit includes an elevated dentifrice retaining pocket or recess that is vertically spaced and raised above the surface of the toothbrush head and preferably positioned in the active brushing zone of the tooth cleaning elements. In contrast to conventional toothbrush bristle constructions in which the dentifrice merely sits on top of the bristles from which it is readily dislodged during brushing, the elevated retaining recess advantageously is specially configured to cradle the dentifrice for minimizing excessive loss and migration of dentifrice from the active brushing zone. This maximizes contact between the dentifrice and teeth during brushing to enhance the effectiveness of the oral care regimen. The retaining recess may be generally configured in the form of a V-shaped pocket in exemplary embodiments that cradles and supports the dentifrice. In some embodiments, the retaining recess may be configured as a circumferentially extending annular groove disposed in the polishing unit with an upwardly open top and a partially or more preferably completely closed bottom portion to better retain the dentifrice.

In preferred embodiments, the polishing units include elastomeric polishing elements that define the dentifrice retaining recess. The polishing elements may each be comprised of a plurality of polishing members in some embodiments that are concentrically arranged around a common point. In one embodiment, each polishing member may be Y-shaped; however other suitable configurations are possible.

According to one exemplary embodiment, a toothbrush according to present invention includes a toothbrush head defining a longitudinal axis and a plurality of tooth cleaning elements supported by the toothbrush head. The tooth cleaning elements included at least one tooth polishing unit having an elastomeric polishing element. An elevated dentifrice retaining recess is defined by the polishing element which is preferably spaced and raised above the toothbrush head for holding dentifrice. In some embodiments, the polishing element may be comprised of a plurality of individual Y-shaped polishing members. In yet further embodiments, the polishing unit includes a bristle element disposed at least partially, and more preferably completely inside the polishing element for enhanced cleaning, polishing and whitening action.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a toothbrush which may have an oral care dispenser, such as a breath freshening, teeth cleaning gel capsule, and an oral care accessory, such as a toothpick.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools airlines, etc. have a need for single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. For example, some toothbrush systems have attempted to meet some of these needs by providing toothpaste within the toothbrush itself, through an integrated channel, for distribution through the toothbrush and around the bristles. This approach can be less economical due to the added manufacturing costs of toothbrushes with integrated channels. In addition, the toothpaste in some of these integrated channel toothbrushes, not being properly sealed, has a tendency to become dry, hard and stale.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274 shows an apparatus for brushing teeth that includes an outer bag, a toothbrush sealed within the outer bag, and a dispenser sealed within the outer bag and containing a mouth care solution. In use, the rupturable dispenser is squeezed or otherwise subjected to pressure while the toothbrush remains sealed within the outer bag. Unfortunately, the apparatus for brushing teeth requires an outer bag, increasing the cost of the apparatus, and fails to provide the rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 discloses a disposable, waterless tooth brushing assembly that includes a toothbrush, a non-foaming, saliva-activated, teeth-cleaning agent pre-applied to the bristles of the toothbrush, a small moistened disposable towel for user after teeth cleaning, and a compact, lightweight, two-layer heat-sealed packaging container for pre-use sanitary storage of the toothbrush and towel. Like U.S. Pat. No. 6,135,274, the assembly of U.S. Pat. No. 6,397,860 requires a packaging container, increasing the cost of the assembly, and fails to provide a rupturable dispenser and toothbrush as one complete, connected unit. The reference also fails to provide a toothpick mechanism for cleaning in between teeth, and which is also connected to the toothbrush.

Published U.S. application 2002/0106234 discloses a chewable toothbrush made of a flexible shell with bristles coupled to the shell and a chewable centerpiece disposed within the shell interior. A burstable capsule is disposed adjacent to the chewable centerpiece within the shell interior and maintains a digestible fluid.

None of the toothbrush assemblies of the related art includes a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice, a toothpick, and a toothbrush as one complete, connected unit or the various other combinations of oral care members and materials, later described. Thus, there is a need in the art for a waterless, toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth or other accessory, and a dispenser containing a dentifrice or other oral care material and being connected in the bristle or cleaning element portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening or other oral care benefits.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention solves the problems of the related art by providing in one embodiment a waterless toothbrush having a toothpick connected thereto to enable cleaning in between teeth, and a rupturable dispenser containing a dentifrice and being connected in the bristle portion of the toothbrush for dispensing the dentifrice to the teeth to provide teeth cleaning and breath freshening, all of which deliver a cleaning, polishing, whitening, between teeth cleaning, and breath freshening action in addition to enhancing the cleaning efficiency of a typical disposable or limited use toothbrush. The toothbrush of the present invention in this embodiment combines three benefits into one toothbrush: (1) tooth surface cleaning provided by the toothbrush bristles or other cleaning elements and the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser; (2) between teeth cleaning provided by the toothpick; and (3) breath freshening provided by the dentifrice in the rupturable dispenser.

As embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention is broadly drawn to an oral care toothbrush, preferably comprising: a handle having an oral care head mounted to one end of the handle with an oral care accessory mounted to an opposite end of the handle. A plurality of oral care elements such as cleaning/massage elements, which could be bristles, extend outwardly from the outer surface of the head. The head also includes structure for dispensing oral care material in the oral care field of the head.

In a preferred practice of the invention the oral care toothbrush is characterized by its small size and light weight so that it is readily adaptable for travel use. The oral care toothbrush is preferably capable of having multiple functions by including an accessory as part of the toothbrush such as a toothpick, dental floss or tongue cleaner.

In one practice of this invention the oral care toothbrush includes a toothpick formed at one end of the handle; and a head connected at another end of said handle, said head having a bristle block that includes a plurality of bristles and retains a gel capsule therein, the gel capsule containing a mouth care solution. In further embodiments, the gel capsule can be replaced by a quantity of toothpowder, toothpaste or a tooth cleaning gel dentifrice, to provide the cleaning benefits of the dentifrice within the rupturable dispenser.

Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only and are not restrictive of the invention, as claimed.

Among the advantages of various practices of the invention are that the size and configuration of the toothbrush allows discreet hygienic use, such as no fingers in the mouth, adapting it to be readily used in public areas. Such uses could be done without the need for a sink or fountain or other source of water.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The formation of dental plaque is a source of gingival and periodontal disease and subsequent tooth loss. Dental plaque is a mixed matrix of bacteria, epithelial cells, leukocytes, macrophages and other oral exudate. Bacteria comprise approximately three-quarters of the plaque matrix. Any given sample of dental plaque could contain as many as 400 different varieties of microorganisms. This mix includes both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, fungi and protozoa. Viruses have also been found in samples of dental plaque.

This matrix of organisms and oral exudate continues expanding and coalesces with other plaque growths situated nearby. The bacteria synthesize levans and glucans from sucrose found in the oral cavity providing energy for the microorganisms. These glucans, levans and microorganisms form an adhesive skeleton for the continued proliferation of plaque.

Calculus is a yellow or white mineralized deposit of bacterial plaque. Inorganic in nature, calculus consists primarily of calcium and magnesium phosphate and calcium carbonate. Calculus forms in layers as does plaque and is simply the mineralization of plaque's layered bacteria. Calculus is formed when plaque's protein-carbohydrate matrix accumulates calcium followed by the precipitation and mineralization of crystalline calcium phosphate. Once mineralized calculus is formed, another layer of bacteria adheres to the surface forming yet another layer of plaque winch is subsequently mineralized into calculus.

The failure to retard or stop the proliferation of plaque is detrimental to oral health. Plaque formation leads to dental caries, gingival inflammation, periodontal disease and ultimately tooth loss. The present inventors recognize these problems and have developed a composition suitable for combating oral disease preventing tooth loss, and leading to general oral well-being.

While the prior art discloses the use of various oral compositions for combating plaque, there is still a need for additional formulations, which provide greater availability, improved performance in combating oral disease along with increased user acceptance. The present inventors have discovered the use of traditional dentifrice ingredients in a base in order to create a non-traditional, portable and consumer desirable toothtape.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

Soap mix cleansing composition containing triclocarban.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Soap mix cleansing compositions are aqueous compositions that contain fatty acid soap and synthetic surfactants in combination. Soap mix compositions are typically used by consumers that want a squeaky clean skin feel similar to that provided by bar soap. Shower gels that contain all synthetic surfactants leave the skin feeling smooth. The squeaky clean feel is desired by consumers in Asia and Latin America.

Consumers have a desire for a cleansing composition to provide an antibacterial benefit. Antibacterial agents are typically added to the cleansing composition. Triclocarban (3,4,4′-trichlorocarbanilide or 3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)urea or TCC) is a common antibacterial agent that is used in bar soaps. Triclocarban, however, is not stable in soap mix compositions in that it precipitates out after a short period of time when included in amounts that are greater than 0.01 weight % of the composition. At this low level, triclocarban is used in conjunction with another antibacterial agent. It would be desirable for a soap mix formula to stably retain triclocarban in greater amounts to deliver an antibacterial benefit.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An aqueous, liquid cleansing composition comprising a fatty acid soap, a salt of a lauryl ether sulfate surfactant that is present in an amount that is at least 50% of the weight of the fatty acid soap, a betaine surfactant that is present in an amount that is at least 23% of the weight of the fatty acid soap, and at least 0.05% by weight of the composition of triclocarban.

Also, method of solubilizing triclocarban in a soap mix composition comprising mixing the fatty acid soap, the lauryl ether sulfate surfactant, the betaine surfactant, the triclocarban, and water of the composition.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with an enhanced cleaning head. An oral care implement such as a toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well as cleaning gum tissue surrounding the teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. Conventional toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice on the head for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from contact with the teeth. As a result the dentifrice often is spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

The present invention seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and other drawbacks of the prior art, and to provide new features not heretofore available.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a configuration of tooth cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of teeth and gums via improved retention and delivery of dentifrice.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to an oral hygiene device configured to store a supply of floss, and in particular, to a oral hygiene device having an engagement interface between a head and a handle, with the supply of floss being accessible from the interface.

Oral hygiene devices, such as toothbrushes, inter-dental devices, gum massagers, tongue scrapers, etc. are known for promoting oral hygiene. The use of floss to provide another level of oral hygiene care is also known. Certain products have combined oral hygiene devices with floss storage capabilities. However, these products are generally cumbersome with respect to a user accessing and using the floss. For example, certain products store a supply of floss in relatively bulky external housings in the grip area of a toothbrush handle, such that the user's grip on the handle of the toothbrush is less than optimal during the toothbrushing process. Other products store a supply of floss in housings at the base of the toothbrush handle such that accessing the floss requires changing one's grip on the handle. Even further, with some products, water used to the rinse the toothbrush could enter the area where the floss is stored, thereby ruining and contaminating the stored floss. This negatively impacts the ability of the user to easily rinse the toothbrush.

Providing a simple and convenient device for both promoting oral hygiene and flossing and that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices would be desirable. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Certain embodiments of an oral hygiene device, which can provide improved access to a supply of floss and ease of flossing, are described.

In accordance with a first aspect, an oral hygiene device has a head and a handle. The handle is configured to accommodate a user's hand grip when the head is inserted into a user's mouth. The handle is further configured to accommodate, at a distal end of the handle, a proximal end of the head. One of the head and the handle is provided with a cavity configured to receive a supply of floss. The cavity becomes accessible when the head and the handle are at least partially detached from one another.

The oral hygiene device may include a supply of floss received within the cavity. A strand of the supply of floss may be affixed to the handle or the head or to both the handle and the head.

According to another aspect, a method for using an oral hygiene device is provided. The oral hygiene device includes a head for insertion into a user's mouth during an oral hygiene session and a handle for accommodating a hand grip of a user during an oral hygiene session. The method includes at least partially disconnecting the head from the handle at an interface area and accessing a supply of floss from the interface area. The method may further include cutting a portion of the supply of floss from the oral hygiene device.

The present application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/039194, filed Apr. 1, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dentinal hypersensitivity is defined as acute, localized tooth pain in response to physical stimulation as by thermal (hot or cold), osmotic, tactile, and/or a combination of thermal, osmotic and tactile stimulation of the exposed dentin.

It is known to the art that potassium salts are effective in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity. For example, the prior art discloses that toothpastes containing potassium salts, such as potassium nitrate, desensitize the teeth after tooth brushing for several weeks. It is reported that an elevation in the extracellular potassium concentration in the vicinity of pulpal nerves underlying sensitive dentin is responsible for the therapeutic desensitizing effect of topically applied oral products which contain potassium nitrate. Due to passive diffusion of potassium ion into and out of the open dentine tubules, repeated application of the active ingredient is necessary to build up the necessary concentration in the vicinity of the pulpal nerves.

In addition to treating dental hypersensitivity, it is desirable to provide dentifrice to control dental plaque. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity, e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line and the like. Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. For example, halogenated hydroxydiphenyl ether compounds such as triclosan are well known to the art for their antibacterial activity and have been used in oral compositions to counter plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity. The effectiveness of the antibacterial agent is dependent upon its delivery to and uptake by teeth and soft tissue areas of the gums.

There is therefore a need in the art to provide means whereby the delivery to and uptake by dental tissue of antibacterial compounds contained in oral compositions containing potassium ions to provide therapeutic efficacy of the antibacterial agent with a desensitizing dentifrice.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

in a first aspect, this invention provides an oral composition including an orally acceptable vehicle for such composition, an effective therapeutic amount of an antibacterial compound, a mixture of anionic surfactant and amphoteric surfactant, the mixture having 0.1 wt. % to 2.0 wt. % anionic surfactant based on the weight of the composition and 0.8 wt. % to 2.0 wt. % amphoteric surfactant based on the weight of the composition, and a potassium ion releasable compound. The composition exhibits increased uptake by dental tissue of antibacterial compounds contained therein and eliminates or substantially reduces the discomfort and pain associated with dentinal hypersensitivity.

In a second aspect, this invention provides a method for the treatment and prevention of bacterial plaque accumulation with reduced discomfort and pain associated with dentinal hypersensitivity comprising: administering to the oral cavity an oral composition comprising: an effective therapeutic amount of an antibacterial compound, a mixture of anionic surfactant and amphoteric surfactant, the mixture having 0.1 wt. % to 2.0 wt. % anionic surfactant based on the weight of the composition and 0.8 to 2.0 wt. % amphoteric surfactant based on the weight of the composition, and a potassium ion releasable compound.

In another aspect, this invention provides oral composition comprising an orally acceptable vehicle for such composition, an effective therapeutic amount of an antibacterial compound comprising a halogenated diphenyl ether, an effective therapeutic amount of an anti-hypersensitivity agent comprising a potassium salt, and a solubilizing agent for the antibacterial compound, the solubilizing agent comprising at least one of an ethoxylated sodium lauryl sulfate and a sodium cocoyl alkyl isethionate.

As will be demonstrated herein, the solubilizing agent, which may comprise the anionic/amphoteric surfactant mixture, results in uptake and bioavailability of the antibacterial agent which is unexpectedly higher for compositions having different surfactant compositions in the presence of potassium ion releasable compounds.

This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/293,079, filed on Jan. 7, 2010, which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

This application relates to oral care compositions, and more particularly to compositions comprising chalcone compounds. Specifically, the invention relates to oral care compositions containing phenyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxystryryl ketone as a pH induced color change component. Such compositions include for example, dentifrices.

The use of mouthwash is adjunctive to toothbrushing. However, the use of mouthwash does not require as much active interaction as does brushing one's teeth. It also does not provide a signal that anything has happened during the use aside from mouth feel that is usually astringent or burning.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides, in various embodiments, oral care compositions comprising a chalcone color change component, in which the composition changes color by contact with saliva and/or by a change in pH. More specifically, the chalcone color change component is phenyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxystyryl ketone (CHAK4). In one embodiment, the oral care composition is a mouthwash.

Yet another feature of the invention relates to a method of making an oral care composition comprising phenyl-3-methoxy-4-hydroxystyryl ketone (CHAK4) as a color change component.

Still another feature of the invention relates to a method of providing oral health benefits to an oral surface.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, more particularly, to a kit having a toothbrush and an oral care dispenser containing an oral care material.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The advantages of good dental hygiene are well known. Often, however, toothbrushes are forgotten when one is traveling or away from home. Hotels, health care facilities, nursing homes, hospitals, daycare facilities, schools, airlines, etc. can use single use disposable or limited multiple use toothbrushes that may be economically supplied to and discarded by individuals without a toothbrush and/or a water supply. Such toothbrushes could be used in vending machines, or distributed in large quantities for simple, portable use from anywhere.

Various types of disposable, limited use, or portable toothbrushes are known in the art. An improved portable toothbrush is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In some embodiments, an oral care kit comprises a sachet having a ring shaped reservoir for an oral care material configured around a central opening. The sachet has a first weakened portion for forming a dispensing nozzle. An oral care implement is sized so that a portion of the oral care implement fits through the central opening. The oral care implement is configured to be used to tear the first weakened portion of the reservoir.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Antiperspirant salts, such as aluminum chlorohydrex (also called aluminum chlorohydrex polymeric salts and abbreviated here as “ACH”) and aluminum zirconium glycine salts (abbreviated here as “ZAG”, “ZAG complexes” or “AZG”), are known to contain a variety of polymeric and oligomeric species with molecular weights (MW) of 100-500,000. It has been clinically shown that, in general, the smaller the species, the higher the efficacy for reducing sweat.

In an attempt to increase the quality and quantity of smaller aluminum and/or zirconium species, a number of efforts have focused on: (1) how to select the components of ACH and ZAG that affect the performance of these materials as antiperspirants; and (2) how to manipulate these components to obtain and/or maintain the presence of smaller types of these components. These attempts have included the development of analytical techniques to identify the components. Size exclusion chromatography (“SEC”) or gel permeation chromatography (“GPC”) are methods frequently used for obtaining information on polymer distribution in antiperspirant salt solutions. With appropriate chromatographic columns, generally five distinctive groups of polymer species can be detected in commercial ACH and ZAG complexes appearing in a chromatogram as peaks 1, 2, 3, 4 and a peak known as “5, 6”. Peak 1 is the larger Zr species (greater than 60 Angstroms). Peaks 2 and 3 are larger aluminum species. Peak 4 is smaller aluminum species (aluminum oligomers, or small aluminum cluster) and has been correlated with enhanced efficacy for both Al and Al/Zr salts. Peak 5, 6 is the smallest aluminum species. Various analytical approaches for characterizing the peaks of ACH and various types of ZAG actives are found in “Antiperspirant Actives—Enhanced Efficacy Aluminum-Zirconium-Glycine (AZG) Salts” by Dr. Allan H. Rosenberg (Cosmetics and Toiletries Worldwide, Fondots, D. C. ed., Hartfordshire, UK: Aston Publishing Group, 1993, pages 252, 254-256).

Attempts to activate antiperspirant salts to produce materials having improved efficacy have included developing processes for obtaining composition having large amounts of Peak 4 species. None of these efforts, however, have resulted in an antiperspirant composition having a composition with little or no Peak 3 and optionally little or no Peak 5.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides for an antiperspirant active composition comprising an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, exhibiting a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution, and optionally including zirconium.

The present invention also provides for a method of making an antiperspirant active composition that exhibits a SEC chromatogram having a SEC Peak 4 to Peak 3 intensity ratio of at least 7 and a Peak 4 intensity greater than a Peak 5 intensity in aqueous solution comprising:I) heating an aqueous solution containing an aluminum salt having an aluminum to chloride molar ratio of about 0.3:1 to about 3:1, optionally with a buffer agent, at a temperature of about 50° C. to about 95° C. to reflux for a period of time of about 1 hour to about 5 hours to obtain an aluminum salt solution;II) adding an aqueous solution of an inorganic base to obtain an aluminum salt solution having an OH:Al molar ratio of about 2:1 to about 2.6:1 to obtain a pH adjusted aluminum salt solution having a pH of about 2 to about 5; andIII) optionally adding an aqueous solution containing a zirconium compound to the pH adjusted aluminum salt solution to thereby obtain an aluminum-zirconium salt solution having a molar ratio of aluminum to zirconium of about 5:1 to about 10:1.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. No. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C.];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement with a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in the mouth.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. The tongue is a haven for the growth of microorganisms since the papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While bladed tongue scrapers have been used in the past, these scrapers are inadequate in respect to their effectiveness on the soft tissue surface of the tongue. Broad flat scraping blades are limited in their ability to reach between the papillae where the bacteria and microdebris have collected. Moreover, notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by any ability to clean the tongue, some users avoid the use of such blades because of lack of comfort on the tongue surface.

Hence, there is a need for an oral care implement with a tongue cleanser that provides effective removal of the tongue bacteria and other debris while maintaining comfort to the user.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement with a tissue cleanser that provides improved cleaning and effective removal of bacteria and microdebris disposed on the oral tissue surfaces.

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face; a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections; and one or more peg members extending from a lower base surface of the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising one or more complementary apertures that receive the one or more peg members and expose tops of the one or more peg members.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face; and a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections extending beyond the second face of the head.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head having a longitudinal axis; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a receiving cavity formed into a second face of the head opposite the first face, the receiving cavity comprising a peripheral sidewall extending away from a lower base surface; a soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded into the receiving cavity to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of nubs that extend beyond the second face of the head; and at least one peg member aligned along the longitudinal axis and extending from the lower base surface of the receiving cavity, the soft tissue cleanser comprising at least one complementary aperture that exposes a top of the at least one peg member.

In an even further aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a head and a handle; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from a first face of the head; a soft tissue cleanser on the head opposite the first face, the soft tissue cleanser formed of an elastomeric material that is injection molded to the head to bond the soft tissue cleanser to the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising a plurality of projections; and at least one peg member aligned along the longitudinal axis and extending from the head, the soft tissue cleanser comprising at least one complementary aperture that exposes a top of the at least one peg member

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleanser for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached. The cleaning elements of these toothbrushes are configured for cleaning and/or for polishing a user's teeth, but are not configured for effective cleaning of soft tissue in a user's mouth, such as the user's tongue.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a flexible support on the head and are outwardly movable from the head. The cleaning elements may include a column-shaped central bristle at the central portion of the flexible support, and may further include a row of first cleaning elements traversing a central region of the flexible support. The oral care implement may further include a soft tissue cleanser on the head, which may be disposed on an opposite face from the cleaning elements. The soft tissue cleanser may include a ring of projections.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleanser in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof. These and other aspects are discussed in relation to the following figures.

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements including bristles and wall-like elements and being movable in the outward direction from the head; wherein the cleaning elements comprise a row of first cleaning elements substantially aligned along a longitudinal axis of the head and traversing a central region of the flexible support; and wherein some of the wall-like cleaning elements laterally radiate from the central region of the flexible support.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements comprising: a plurality of central cleaning elements disposed substantially along a longitudinal axis of the head; and for each central cleaning element, a plurality of wall-like cleaning elements that radiate from the central cleaning element to form a star configuration.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle; a flexible support attached to the head and having a face; a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the flexible support and projecting outwardly from the face, the cleaning elements comprising: a plurality of central cleaning elements disposed in a first row substantially along a longitudinal axis of the head; a plurality of transverse cleaning element disposed in a second row along a transverse axis that is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis; and wherein the central cleaning elements and the transverse cleaning elements intersect in a central region of the flexible support to form a cross-shape.

"FIELD

This application is directed to the manufacture of confectionery products and more particularly to the manufacture of heat stable chocolate and chocolaty candy.

BACKGROUND

Traditional chocolate making methods are well known and involve several basic steps carried out in a particular order. Generally, the process starts with cocoa beans harvested from pods of melon-like fruit that grow on the cacao tree. The cocoa beans are removed from the pods and placed in large heaps or piles to ferment, during which the shells of the beans harden and darken and a rich cocoa flavor develops.

Dried cocoa beans are roasted at very high temperatures and hulled to separate the shell from the inside of the bean, also called a “nib,” the part of the bean actually used to make chocolate. The nibs are milled by a grinding process that turns the nibs into a liquid called chocolate liquor.

The chocolate liquor, which is sometimes separated in advance into its constituents, cocoa butter and cocoa powder, is mixed with a sweetener, usually sugar, and in the case of milk chocolate, milk solids are also added.

The chocolate liquor is also combined with milk and sugar and is dried to a coarse, brown powder called chocolate crumb. Additional cocoa butter may be added to the chocolate crumb, after which the mixture passes through steel rollers which refine the mixture above the melting point of the cocoa butter, resulting in a chocolate powder. The chocolate powder is then conched, a process in which the chocolate powder is maintained above the fat melting temperature while mixing elements smooth out gritty particles, remove moisture and off-flavors, and develop pleasant flavors. Conching also releases fat from the chocolate powder, increasing the fat coating on the particles so that the chocolate has a proper fluidity for further processing. Additional fat is added to achieve the full formulated fat content and emulsifiers are also added to reduce viscosity and enhance fluidity of the chocolate paste. The liquid chocolate paste is tempered and then poured or deposited into a mould to produce a chocolate bar or used for enrobed products.

The melting temperature of cocoa butter and other fats sometimes used with or in place of cocoa butter in certain chocolate making processes is in the range of 29° C. to 35° C. As a result, chocolate bars and other chocolate confections cannot always be readily transported, stored or enjoyed in the summertime or in tropical climates where temperatures of unconditioned spaces typically reach or exceed the melting point of the fat in the chocolate. Even where the confections are stored or consumed in a conditioned space, if they melt during transit and then resolidify, the products may become misshapen or exhibit bloom, a condition in which the melted fat in the chocolate recrystallizes in a different structure resulting in a change in appearance or texture that can render the product unappealing.

Various attempts have been directed to trying to develop a heat stable chocolate that could better withstand conditions of elevated temperature. Efforts to date have generally involved modifying formulations by adding ingredients to the chocolate that provide heat stability. In some cases, special ingredients are added that are designed to absorb moisture during processing or after packaging. In other cases, water is incorporated directly into the chocolate during manufacture, such as using water-oil emulsions. However, chocolate products made using these kinds of additional ingredients generally have a dry, crumbly texture that is undesirable and also suffer from flavor deterioration over a shorter shelf life as a result of the high moisture content. In still other cases, high melting fats have been used, but chocolate confections having these kinds of fats are also disfavored because they tend to have a negative, waxy eating quality.

These and other drawbacks are associated with current methods of confectionery production.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to producing chocolate confectionery products that do not need to be specially formulated and can be made with traditional chocolate making ingredients, but which still exhibit heat stable characteristics. Methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments result in a chocolate confectionery product having a rheology such that the product retains its shape above the melting point of fats in the product, while retaining a flavor and mouthfeel comparable with chocolate made by traditional methods.

In one embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising a chocolate compatible fat and a sweetener; thereafter refining the mixture to form a powder having a predetermined average particle size; thereafter agitating the refined powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible fat to form a dough; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product.

In another embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising a chocolate compatible tempering fat, milk, cocoa solids and sugar; thereafter refining the mixture to form a chocolate powder having an average particle size in the range of about 10 to about 30 microns at a temperature less than the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible tempering fat; thereafter agitating the refined chocolate powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible tempering fat to form a dough; tempering the dough in the presence of greater than about 0.3% by weight tempering seed; forming the dough into a predetermined shape; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product. The amount of fat present in the mixture being refined is about 29% by weight or greater.

In yet another embodiment, a method for creating a confectionery product comprises providing a mixture comprising cocoa solids, sugar, milk fat, and a chocolate compatible fat selected from the group consisting of cocoa butter replacements, cocoa butter substitutes and combinations thereof; thereafter refining the mixture to form a chocolate powder having a predetermined average particle size; thereafter agitating the refined chocolate powder mixture at a temperature above the melting temperature of the chocolate compatible fat to form a dough; thereafter forming the dough into a predetermined shape; and thereafter solidifying the dough to form a confectionery product.

In still another embodiment, a heat stable confectionery product is provided that includes cocoa solids, milk solids, sugar, and a chocolate compatible fat, wherein the chocolate compatible fat has a melting temperature in the range of about 29° C. to about 35° C., and wherein the product has a smooth texture and a shelf life up to at least 6 months at temperatures above 32° C. Any other ingredients are present in amounts that do not interfere with the product's ability to form a dough above the melting temperature of the fat.

An advantage is that chocolate confectionery products produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments have a rheology such that the product maintains its shape above the melting temperature of the fat in the chocolate, without becoming messy or liquid-like.

Another advantage is that chocolate confectionery products produced in accordance with exemplary embodiments can be formulated with the same as or less than the overall fat content as chocolate confectioneries produced by traditional methods.

Yet another advantage is that methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments can produce chocolate confections using traditional chocolate making ingredients and avoid the kind of additives previously used to create heat stable chocolate that result in undesirable eating qualities and poor shelf life.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Effective medical management of dental caries is required for populations of patients that exhibit increased risk factors for caries. It is known that the presence of dental caries in certain patient subpopulations accounts for a substantial proportion of the dental caries seen in the population at large. Reports exist indicating that in the United States, 25% of children account for 75% of dental caries.

One present practice to reduce dental caries in children is the periodic application, e.g., 1 to 2 times per year, of a foamable fluoride composition having a relatively high concentration of a fluoride releasing salt, e.g., 1-3% by weight sodium fluoride, that is packaged in an aerosol container in combination with an aerosol propellant. The composition is dispensed from the container into the trough of a dental tray as a dense, stable, non-flowable foam which is superimposed about and into engagement with the teeth to be treated, to affect fluoride uptake by the dental enamel.

Although conventional dental foams may be effective and are in present commercial use, in practice, the thick, dense foam that is produced may cause the patient to experience discomfort during treatment. Additionally, upon completion of treatment, the residual dense foam may be difficult and/or time consuming to remove from the patient's mouth. For at least these reasons, conventional foams may discourage professional usage and patient compliance with the fluoride treatment.

Therefore, what is needed in the art is an improved dental fluoride foam composition for the treatment of tooth surfaces that facilitates professional usage and patient compliance so that treatment can be repeated over time to provide effective fluoride treatment for dental caries.

The invention includes a low density foamable oral care composition comprising an aqueous solution of: a fluoride ion releasable salt; a surface active agent selected from the group consisting of nonionic surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants betaine surfactants, and mixtures thereof, and an acidifying agent in an amount sufficient to adjust the pH of the composition to about 3 to about 5, wherein the composition is substantially free of precipitates when maintained at a temperature of 4.4° C. (40° F.) for 12 hours.

Also included in the invention are related methods.

"BACKGROUND

Shower gels, body washes, cleansing lotions, liquid soaps, and the like (hereinafter collectively referred to as “liquid cleaning compositions” be they liquids, gels, lotions or foams) have grown increasingly popular in recent times. Such compositions typically comprise a mixture of surfactants as skin cleaning agents. The performance of these compositions can be modified by modifying the interaction of the surfactants in the mixed surfactant system.

It is known to use salts to modify the packing of surfactants to achieve higher viscosity. See, e.g., Lin et al., “Spherical-To-Wormlike Micelle Transition In CTAB Solutions”, J. Phys. Chem., 1994, 98, 5984-5993 and Yang, “Viscoelastic wormlike micelles and their applications”, Current Opinion in Colloid & Interface Science 7 (2002) 276-281. With the addition of increasing concentrations of salt, the viscosity typically increases, reaches a maximum, and suddenly decreases. This observation is related to the formation of dense wormlike micelles (tighter packing which results in high viscosities) and then branched wormlike micelles (which causes the viscosity to drop).

However, high levels of salt cause the cleaning product to be stringy, and adversely affect the foam properties of the product.

It is therefore desired to increase the viscosity of liquid cleaning compositions and to create different compositional forms.

SUMMARY

An aqueous composition comprising: a) surfactants comprising a salt of a C10-16alcohol ethoxylate sulfate, a betaine surfactant, and an alkyl polyglucoside; and b) at least 8 weight % of the composition of a C12-18fatty alcohol. At this level of fatty alcohol, the composition can have a lotion like appearance in that it is shear thinning, reduced or no amount of stringiness, and the composition can stand up when dispensed.

Also, a cleansing method comprising applying the composition to skin or hair and washing, and optionally rinsing with water.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods and devices for measuring the extent of deposition or uptake of agents (e.g., oral active agents) onto substrates (e.g., hydroxyapatite surfaces to mimic tooth surfaces). The amount or concentration of an agent may be efficiently determined on a substrate (e.g., with the agent and substrate both in solid form), using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Conventional methods for analyzing the deposition of agents, such as oral active agents used in dental care, involve incubating the agent with a substrate, washing the incubated substrate, and then subjecting it to solvent extraction. Subsequently, the extract is analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to provide an indirect quantification of the deposited agent. In a particular type of such an analysis, oral active agents such as Triclosan, either in neat solutions or in dentrifrice formulations, are incubated with saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disks used to model hard tissue substrates, prior to performing solvent extraction on the disk.

The solvent-extraction/HPLC method, however, has limitations. For example, the method relies on the indirect analysis of an extract rather than the direct analysis of the surface onto which the agent is deposited. As a result of the extraction and subsequent HPLC steps, the analysis often takes considerable time. Moreover, the method relies on the use of an extracting agent which may not always be compatible with a given agent/substrate system (e.g., may decompose or adversely affect, for example by reaction with, the agent to be analyzed or otherwise influence the form of the agent).

Therefore, a need exists in the art for methods that can efficiently analyze or characterize the rate or amount of deposition of an agent onto a substrate. Ideally, such methods can be performed via direct analysis of the agent/substrate system and provide fast results.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to efficient, reliable methods such as screening methods for characterizing the deposition of agents (e.g., oral active agents) onto surfaces. Such methods can be used to assess and compare different formulations comprising the agent to be deposited, as well as different delivery systems for the agent. The methods are also applicable for evaluation or diagnostic purposes in patients or other users, and can therefore be applied to in vivo systems, for example, in the analysis of deposition of an oral active agent onto the tooth surface of a patient. The methods are also suitable for personal use, for example, in the case of a user desiring to monitor the effectiveness of a particular dental care regimen.

The direct methods described herein can be used to obtain an analytical result in a relatively short time, for example on the order of minutes (e.g., 5-10 minutes) or even seconds (e.g., less than 60 seconds or 10-45 seconds). The analytical methods, according to some embodiments, determine the distribution of various agents about surface, for example, they may be used to determine whether or not they are uniformly distributed.

Accordingly, aspects of the invention relate to a method for measuring deposition of an oral agent such as an oral care active on a substrate. The method comprises contacting the substrate with the oral agent to deposit an amount of the oral agent thereon, and analyzing the substrate using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

Other aspects of the invention relate to a method of diagnosing the oral condition of a patient. The method comprises measuring the presence of an oral agent in a patient sample using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

Other aspects of the invention relate to a method for evaluating the effectiveness of an oral delivery system. The method comprises depositing an oral agent onto a substrate using the dental instrument, and additionally analyzing the substrate using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy to measure the extent of deposition.

Other aspects of the invention relate to devices or instruments for performing any of the above methods.

Other aspects of the invention relate to one or more tangible computer readable media storing executable instructions that, when executed, cause a data processing system to perform a method comprising steps of analyzing a Near-IR spectrum or a UV spectrum generated according to the methods described above, using a mathematical method is selected from the group consisting of first and second derivative, peak area integration, partial least squares regression (PLS), Kubelka-Munk conversion, multiple linear regression, and spectral subtraction (e.g., to subtract background signals).

The methods and devices above can be used in the absolute measurement of amounts or concentrations of agents deposited onto a substrate. Alternatively, the methods may be used to obtain relative amounts or concentrations of these agents (e.g., in the case a monitoring application). The methods may be used to compare the extent of deposition of an agent as a function of its concentration in an initial composition (e.g., in a dentrifrice used to incubate a substrate according to methods described herein), as a function of the use of differing delivery systems (e.g., a paste versus a gel system), or as a function of any of a number of other parameters that will be appreciated by those having skill in the art, having regard for the present disclosure.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following Detailed Description.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is related to devices for testing ovarian reserve in pre- and peri-menopausal women.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many women do not realize that a significant decline in fertility begins in the early 30's. In fact, for many successful fertility treatments, the predominate predictor of pregnancy outcome is the age of the female partner. The significant impact that age has on fertility is related to both the quality and quantity of a woman's eggs.

Women are born with all the eggs that they will ever have. As such, the ovary can be generally thought of as an egg bank from which a woman withdraws during her reproductive life. Each month one egg or more is released during ovulation, but about one thousand additional eggs are lost by follicular atresia. Thus, with advanced maternal age the number of eggs that can be successfully recruited for a possible pregnancy declines.

In addition to this decrease in the number of eggs that women experience, some women may have poor quality eggs that reduce the likelihood that a given fertility treatment will result in a healthy pregnancy. Ovarian reserve screening is one mechanism by which fertility specialists can partially predict the reproductive potential of a specific patient as well as the potential of her eggs to result in a healthy pregnancy. Ovarian reserve is the term typically used to define the capacity of the ovary to provide eggs that are capable of fertilization. As such, the determination of a woman's ovarian reserve is an important aspect in the management and treatment of infertility.

Assessing ovarian reserve is routinely conducted for determining infertility in women of advanced reproductive age. One of the key indicators to determine the reproductive potential in women is the basal Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) level on days 2-5 of the menstrual cycle. Elevated FSH at the early follicular phase is indicative of diminished ovarian reserve. Currently, the most common test for assessing ovarian reserve is the day 3 FSH test. This blood test determines the level of FSH on cycle day 3. Cycle day 3 is chosen because at this time the estrogen level is expected to be low, a critical feature, as FSH levels are subject to a negative feedback. Generally FSH levels are expected to be below 10 mIU/ml in women with reproductive potential (e.g., levels of 10-15 mIU/ml are considered borderline).

While measuring serum FSH is still the standard practice and widely adopted in fertility clinics, such testing is not well suited for home use by an individual. As such, there remains a need for a reliable and more convenient and cost effective diagnostic test for home use, such as an over the counter test.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention satisfies at least some of the aforementioned needs by providing a diagnostic test kit that assesses ovarian reserve by assessing Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) in urine, preferably Day 3 first morning urine. Embodiments of the present invention comprise a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample deposited preferably on a sample absorbent in contact with a first portion of the device for transport to a second portion of the device, such as a lateral flow platform. These embodiments can include a release medium formed of a first material, such as Ahlstrom 989, and a labeled conjugate comprising a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH. The release medium also can include a biotinylated capturable component having a second binding member reactive with a second epitope of FSH. In such embodiments, if FSH is present in the sample a complex is formed between the labeled conjugate, FSH, and the biotinylated capturable component. These embodiments also can include a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium. The capture medium is formed of a different material, such as nitrocellulose, than the release medium. The capture medium can include a test site having immobilized thereon a capture component. The capture component in these embodiments is capable of binding with the biotinylated capturable component.

Accordingly, a liquid sample applied to the release medium at a sample deposit location positioned upstream of both the labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component wicks downstream past the labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component (not necessarily in this order). If the sample includes any FSH, then a sandwich complex is formed between the labeled conjugate, FSH, and the biotinylated capturable component. As the liquid sample front travels from the release medium onto the capture medium, the complex is carried across the capture medium until it reaches the test site, which includes an immobilized binding member reactive with the biotinylated capturable component. When FSH is in the sample, the labeled complex (i.e., labeled conjugate-FSH-biotinylated capturable component) is bound and capable of being detected at the test site.

In other embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level. In certain embodiments, the predetermined amount or level of FSH can be referred to as a threshold amount of FSH. Particularly, the predetermined level can refer to FSH at a concentration that is deemed to be an elevated level. Preferred embodiments include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample and a first portion (e.g., a release medium) including a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH. The labeled conjugate is preferably present in excess relative to an amount of labeled conjugate necessary to bind the FSH present at the predetermined level. The device also includes a second portion including a test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH bound to the labeled conjugate and a reference site having immobilized thereon a capture component comprising a binding member that binds a portion of the excess amount of the labeled conjugate. The device can also include a reservoir for containing liquid sample and excess labeled conjugate not captured at the test site and the reference site. In such embodiments, the color intensity of the reference site is calibrated to be inversely proportional to the concentration of FSH present in the sample. Assessment of the FSH level in the sample is based on the comparison of resulting color intensities at the test site and reference site.

In certain embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH present in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level. The device can include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample, a first portion including a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH, and a second portion including a single test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH. In such embodiments, the device can be calibrated such that a signal (e.g., color development) indicating binding of FSH at the test site only occurs when FSH is present in the liquid sample at a concentration above the predetermined level and no signal at the test site indicates any FSH in the liquid sample is present at a concentration below the predetermined level.

In other embodiments, the present invention provides a device for detecting FSH in a liquid sample by utilizing a scavenger component. In such embodiments, the device includes a release medium formed of a first material and including a detectable label as well as a capture medium in fluid communication with the release medium. The capture medium is preferably formed of a different material than that of the release medium. The capture medium includes a test site. However, these embodiments also include a scavenger component that is reactive with any of the following: (i) FSH, (ii) a FSH-labeled conjugate complex, (iii) a biotinylated capturable component-FSH-labeled conjugate complex, or (iv) combinations of (i) through (iii). The scavenger component can be located anywhere between the location of sample deposit and the test site.

In preferred embodiments, the scavenger component is provided in an amount to bind with a specific amount of FSH. As such, any amount of FSH above the predetermined level in the sample will be bound to the labeled conjugate and detected at the test site. That is, the specific amount of FSH can be substantially equal to the predetermined level of FSH. The specific amount of FSH to be bound by the scavenger component can be calibrated to correlate with a given concentration to reflect the predetermined level of FSH in the sample. That is, samples having an FSH concentration exceeding the predetermined level will bind with the labeled conjugate and be captured at the test site.

In another embodiment, a device according to the invention for detecting FSH present in a liquid sample at a concentration relative to a predetermined level can be designed to provide a single site or line for reading by a user to determine whether FSH levels are normal or elevated. Specifically, the single line can be a test site, and the device can be designed such that the formation of a signal at the test site indicates FSH values are elevated and the lack of formation at the test site indicates that FSH values are normal. In some embodiments, to indicate to the user that the device is functional (even though no signal is detected at the test site—meaning FSH values are normal), the device may include a control line wherein the presence of a signal is independent of normal or elevated FSH values and solely indicates that the device is functional.

Specifically, a device according to this embodiment of the invention may include a sample application member for receiving the liquid sample; a first portion comprising a labeled conjugate with a detectable label and a first binding member reactive with a first epitope of FSH; and a second portion comprising a single test site having immobilized thereon a capture component capable of directly or indirectly binding FSH. Preferably, the device is calibrated such that a signal indicating binding of FSH at the test site only occurs when FSH is present in the liquid sample at a concentration above the predetermined level and no signal at the test site indicates any FSH in the liquid sample is present at a concentration below the predetermined level. Preferably, the single test site is the only site on the device visible to a user for indicating FSH concentration in the liquid sample.

In the above embodiments, calibration can comprise the use of a scavenger component, which can be located between the sample application member and the test site. Preferably, the scavenger component will bind any FSH present in the sample below the predetermined level. Of course, other means could be used for such calibration.

In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of determining ovarian reserve utilizing a test device according to embodiments of the present invention. In one embodiment, a liquid sample is applied to a sample deposit location positioned upstream of a labeled conjugate and the biotinylated capturable component located on the release medium. The liquid sample travels downstream from the sample deposit location and passes through a site including the labeled conjugate and a site including the biotinylated capturable component. The resulting complex is captured at the test site. The labeled conjugate is detected and signals the presence of FSH. Depending on the concentration of FSH in the sample, the resulting color intensity at the test site will vary.

In preferred embodiments, the capture medium of the test device also includes a reference site having immobilized thereon a binding member reactive with the labeled conjugate. Preferably, the reference site is “active” in the sense that the resulting color intensity changes based on the concentration of FSH in the sample. Specifically, the color intensity at the reference site can be inverse to the concentration of FSH present in the liquid sample. For instance, as FSH concentrations increase, more of the labeled conjugate is complexed with FSH and the biotinylated capturable component and captured at the test site. As a result, less labeled conjugate is available to flow past the test site and bound at the reference site. Accordingly, a woman's ovarian reserve can be determined based by a color comparison or “color matching” of the reference site and the test site. This also may be described as intensity matching or a comparison of the color intensity at the reference site versus the color intensity at the test site.

Preferably, the color intensity of the reference site is calibrated to correlate with the color intensity at the test site. For example, a predetermined level of FSH (e.g., lowest concentration deemed as being elevated) can be selected and an amount of labeled conjugate can be applied to the release medium so that if a sample contains the predetermined level of FSH then a portion of the labeled conjugate will bind the FSH and be captured at the test site while the remainder of the labeled conjugate will pass the test site and a portion will bind at the reference site, with any excess labeled conjugate flowing past the reference site. In such a case, color intensity at the test site and the reference site should be practically equal and signal that the sample contained the predetermined level of FSH. In the event that the sample has an FSH concentration above the predetermined level, the color intensity of the reference site will be lighter than the color intensity of the test site, thus indicating that the FSH concentration of the sample was elevated. If the color intensity of the reference site is darker than that of the test site, then the FSH concentration of the sample was normal.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/036374, filed Mar. 6, 2009, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

There are various techniques to provide a unique appearance to a packaged product. Many techniques are directed to the use of colored containers and attractive labeling. Another technique is to use the product to additionally provide part of the overall unique appearance of the product. U.S. Pat. No. 4,159,028 to Barker et al. discloses a technique for forming a two part cosmetic composition into a random pattern of the composition in a container. This comprises rotating the container at an angle to the filling conduit and filling the rotating and angled container simultaneously with the two parts of the composition. The result will be a random pattern of the two components in the container. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,966,205 to Tanaka there is a modification of the above technique. Here the components are a transparent gel base and a colored material. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,213,166; 6,367,519 and 6,516,838 to Thibiant et al. are directed to an apparatus and process to produce precise and exacting swirl patterns. The compositions can be cosmetic compositions with one component being transparent to translucent and the preferred container being transparent. The two components are filled into the container as the container is being rotated. The filler is raised out of the container as the container is being filled. U.S. Design Pat. Nos. 429,146 and 448,281 disclose some of the patterns that can be produced using the processes of these three patents. Products that can be produced in various patterns are disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication 2005/0143268 to Sanjeev et al. Patterns which can be made from this patent application include the patterns shown in U.S. Design Pat. No. 548,599 and U.S. Design Pat. No. 552,997. These are interesting techniques to produce various designs of products in containers. While the technique of U.S. Pat. No. 4,159,028 usually will produce random patterns the techniques of the latter patents are directed to forming more geometrically defined patterns.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention is directed to a method of forming in a container a diffuse pattern mixture of at least two components, the at least two components having differing visual characteristics, comprising providing a filler/mixer having a mixing chamber, a mixing chamber input conduit into the mixing chamber for each of the at least two components, 0 to about 10 mixing elements in the mixing chamber, an exit conduit from the mixing chamber, a container after the mixing chamber on a container support, the container support being capable of rotating the container; feeding a first component and a second component into the mixing chamber to form a mixture of the first component and the second component; concurrently rotating the container in a first direction and feeding the first component and second component mixture from the mixing chamber into the container; continuing to feed the first component and second component mixture into the container and rotating the container in a second direction, then concurrently separating the container from the mixing chamber during the rotation of the container in a first direction and in a second direction. The rotation of the container in a first direction and in a second direction can optionally be repeated.

In one aspect, the present processes can produce diffuse patterns of one or more products in containers. The results are unique and very artistic patterns. One type of pattern is that of sand art type of pattern. The product in the container will give a sand art appearance to the container. By diffuse pattern is meant a pattern that has a discernable artistic pattern, but where the pattern varies in dimensions and the color varies in color density to provide a color gradation throughout the container. In one embodiment there will be bands of one product dispersed in another product, the bands varying in their dimensions and the color of the bands varying in color density.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, with an enhanced tissue cleaner. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be lead bad breath or oral malodor.

While tongue scrapers have been used in the past, they have generally not been effective or easy to use. Further, many of these scrapers cannot easily be used to cleanse other tissue within the mouth. Notwithstanding the benefits to be gained by cleaning the tissue in the mouth, many users avoid the use of such cleansers due to a lack of comfort and/or ease of use. The present description seeks to overcome certain of these limitations and to provide new features heretofore not available.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention pertains to an oral care implement or toothbrush with a configuration of tissue cleaning elements to provide enhanced cleaning of the tongue and other mouth tissue.

In one aspect of the invention, an oral care implement has a head connected to a handle. The head includes a tooth cleaning element region and a tissue cleaning element region. The tooth cleaning element region may include various bristle or other tooth cleaning element arrangements. The tissue cleaning element region includes a plurality of angled tissue cleaning projections. The tissue cleaning projections can be movable between a plurality of positions to provide directional cleaning.

In another aspect of the invention, the angled tissue cleaning projections can be configured on a portion of the head and another portion of the head can include a plurality of substantially rigid projections formed of a more rigid material than the angled tissue cleaning projections.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and or mechanically driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

FIG. 30schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush19010, which has a head19012and a handle19014. As shown, the head has bristles19016extending from a front face of its head platform19018. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

FIG. 31schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device19030, which is generally the same as toothbrush19010except that it includes a tongue cleaner19020on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 31, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. In one embodiment of the invention, an oral care implement is provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head, which are attached to a support that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements may include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements. The cleaning elements may further include a central support at a central portion of the support.

Embodiments of the invention may be multi-functional and include various combinations of features in advantageous combinations. Some embodiments include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The embodiments may be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

The oral care implement can have flexibly mounted cleaning elements extending in opposite directions. The oral care implement can include a handle and a head with tooth cleaning elements extending from fixed pods and one or more central pods suspended between the fixed pods via a bridge. The bridge may be formed from an elastomer and permit the one or more central pods to move from an initial position toward and away from the head platform during use. The one or more central pods can include first cleaning elements extending in a first direction toward the first face and second cleaning elements extending in a second direction opposite the first direction. The second cleaning elements can extend through one or more apertures in the head platform.

Another embodiment of the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle and having a first side and a second side opposite the first side; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from the head in a direction away from the first side; and a soft tissue cleaner disposed on the second side of the head, the soft tissue cleaner including: (1) a first portion comprising a plurality of projections formed of an elastomeric material and extending in a direction away from the second side of the head; and (2) a second portion comprising a plurality of bristles extending in the direction away from the second side of the head.

Yet another embodiment of the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle and having a first side and a second side opposite the first side; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from the head in a direction away from the first side; and a soft tissue cleaner disposed on the second side of the head, the soft tissue cleaner including: (1) a first portion comprising a plurality of projections extending in a direction away from the second side of the head; and (2) a second portion comprising a plurality of bristles extending in the direction away from the second side of the head.

Still another embodiment of the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head attached to the handle and having a head platform; a first fixed pod extending from a first face of the head platform; at least one movable carrier supported above the first face of the head platform by at least the first fixed pod and a first suspension member; the first suspension member comprising a first reinforcement connector connected to the first fixed pod at a first connection point and to the at least one movable carrier at a second connection point; and wherein the first connection point and the second connection point are located on opposite sides of a longitudinal axis of the head.

A further embodiment of the invention can be a method for forming an oral care implement, the method comprising: attaching first cleaning elements to a first carrier component; attaching second cleaning elements to a second carrier component; forming a dual cleaning elements carrier including connecting the first and second carrier components in an opposite configuration; threading the first cleaning elements through one or more apertures extending through a head platform; and flexibly connecting the dual cleaning elements carrier to the head platform.

Other features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description taken in conjunction with the following drawings.

"BACKGROUND

There have been several forms of antiperspirant/deodorant products, such as sticks, soft solids, roll-ons, and aerosols. The different fauns deliver antiperspirant and/or deodorant actives to axillary areas. There can be disadvantages when formulating these type of products.

One disadvantage is that when an antiperspirant active is included, steps need to be taken to stabilize the antiperspirant from hydrolyzing and polymerizing during storage. When an antiperspirant polymerizes into larger species, the efficacy is reduced.

Another disadvantage is that materials used for delivery, such as in the sticks or soft solids, can leave a white residue on the skin. This can be aesthetically unpleasing when seen on skin or when transferred to clothing during wearing.

It would be advantageous to develop a new form of delivery of antiperspirant and/or deodorant actives.

SUMMARY

An anhydrous liquid antiperspirant/deodorant composition comprising:a) a carrier comprising i) at least one member chosen from a cation and zwitterion and ii) a hydrogen bond donor, wherein an amount of carrier is greater than an amount of any other material in the composition, andb) at least one active chosen from an antiperspirant active and a deodorant active.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, in particular, to a toothbrush with an air flossing system. Individuals exhibit many forms of poor oral health including tooth decay, periodontal diseases and bad breath (halitosis). Tooth decay and periodontal disease are typically caused by harmful bacteria within the mouth. When the harmful bacteria mixes with proteins present in saliva, a film of plaque is formed on the teeth and soft tissue. If the plaque is not removed, it can attack the teeth and create cavities. Additionally, the plaque will attack the soft tissue within the mouth and cause gum disease, the leading cause of tooth loss in adults. Many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth or perform interdental cleaning of their teeth. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

INTRODUCTION

The present invention relates to tooth whitening systems employing compositions comprising hydrophobic polymers. Embodiments of the present invention include tooth whitening systems having dental trays and employing whitening compositions comprising a hydrophobic polymer carrier and a whitening agent.

There is a general desire for people to have white teeth. Such white teeth are an indication of a good health and in particular good oral care health. A problem is that various foods and the use of tobacco will discolor teeth. Beverages such as coffee, tea and cola beverages can discolor teeth.

As a result various products and procedures have been developed to whiten teeth. These products and procedures are either purchased and/or used directly by the consumer or are applied by a dentist or other professional. The more effective products and procedures are those that are performed by a dental professional.

Typically this consists of the dental professional forming a dental tray from an impression of a person's teeth. Custom dental trays can be created by any of the procedures, well known in the art. After the dental tray is formed to the structure of the teeth a whitening formulation is placed in the tray and the tray placed into the mouth and against the teeth to be treated. A dental tray having whitening composition for in-home use is typically left in the mouth for from about 10 minutes to several hours; i.e., up to 12 or more hours. If the treatment occurs in the dental office, the time of the treatment typically will be from about 0.5 hour to about 2 hours.

The products used solely by consumers primarily comprise whitening strips and brush-on products. Whitening strips are plastic strips with the whitening formulation on one surface. The surface with the whitening formulation is pressed against one's teeth and left in contact with the teeth for about 30 minutes. The plastic strip then is removed. The brush-on products are painted into teeth and the user keeps his/her mouth at least partially open for up to about a minute until the formulation dries onto the teeth. In both cases saliva will dilute and flush the tooth whitening composition from the user's teeth. This occurs more so with strips, since foreign materials (such as, a plastic strip), will enhance saliva flow in the mouth. These products are useful to remove some tooth staining. However, they are typically not as concentrated, and thus not as effective tooth whitening systems, as are dental trays, and in particular the use of dental trays by dental professionals.

A problem with the various whitening compositions that are used in dental trays is that they are substantially soluble in water and saliva. This results in a dilution of the whitening formulation during use. In order to overcome this problem producers of these whitening formulations have increased the concentration of the whitening actives. However, this causes a problem of increased tooth sensitivity, gum irritation and the potential long term for lesions. Another solution disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,846,058 has been to use higher viscosity tooth whitening compositions. This increases dilution time and flush time but is not a full solution to the problem. A better solution to this problem is to use a carrier and actives that are substantially insoluble in water and saliva, the carrier being about fully insoluble in water and saliva. The active must have some solubility in order to attack and remove tooth stains. However, it is preferred that the solubility of the active is relatively low. In this way, tooth whitening compositions with a lower concentration of active can be used to enhance whitening through a longer contact time at a more sustained active concentration.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides tooth whitening systems. Embodiments include a tooth whitening system comprising a dental tray having a surface operable to confront a tooth surface and a tooth whitening composition comprising a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier.

In another embodiment, the present invention further provides a method of whitening a surface of a tooth, comprising contacting the surface with a whitening composition contained in a dental tray. The whitening composition comprises a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier.

Another embodiment includes a tooth whitening kit, for whitening the surface of a tooth in the oral cavity of a human or other animal subject, comprising (a) a dental tray operable for insertion into the oral cavity of the subject, comprising a reservoir. The kit also comprises (b) a tooth whitening composition comprising a peroxide whitening agent and a hydrophobic siloxane polymer carrier having a viscosity of at least about 50,000 centipoise (cP).

It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over whitening compositions among those known in the art including one or more of: enhanced whitening efficacy, providing a higher available concentration of whitening agent, adherence of the whitening composition to the tooth surface even in the presence of saliva and sustained and controlled delivery of the whitening agent for a longer duration of time Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

Tooth Whitening System

In various embodiments, the present invention provides an improved tooth whitening system that comprises a dental tray and a tooth whitening composition. The tooth whitening composition comprises a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier. In various embodiments of the present invention, the whitening composition is a viscous suspension which maintains its consistency during storage. The hydrophobic polymer carrier of the whitening composition is preferably not soluble in water and is stable for longer durations during exposure to saliva and other aqueous solutions found in an oral cavity, as compared to prior art water-soluble whitening solutions.

Whitening Compositions

The present invention provides a whitening composition for use in a tooth whitening system. In one embodiment, the whitening composition comprises a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier. The whitening composition may further comprise an adhesion enhancing agent. Other additional ingredients that may be added include those known to one of skill in the art, including one or more of the following components: surfactants, flavoring agents, sweeteners, desensitizing agents, antimicrobial agents, anti-caries agents, anti-calculus agents, anti-inflammatory agents, vitamins, pigments and coloring agents, and enzymes, as will be discussed in greater detail below.

Active ingredients useful herein are optionally present in the compositions of the present invention in safe and effective amounts. A “safe and effective” amount of an active is an amount that is sufficient to have the desired therapeutic or prophylactic effect in the human or lower animal subject to whom the active is administered, without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response), commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. The specific safe and effective amount of the active will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the subject, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), the specific active used, the specific dosage form, the carrier employed, and the desired dosage regimen.

Whitening Agents

In various embodiments, the compositions of the present invention comprise a whitening agent as the main active ingredient. As further discussed below, a “whitening agent” is a material which effects whitening of a tooth surface to which it is applied. In various embodiments, the whitening compositions of this invention comprise a whitening agent selected from the group consisting of peroxides, chlorites, and hypochlorites. Examples of suitable chlorites and hypochlorites include those having alkali or alkaline metal cations and include calcium chlorite, barium chlorite, magnesium chlorite, lithium chlorite, sodium chlorite, potassium chlorite, calcium hypochlorite, barium hypochlorite, magnesium hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, lithium hypochlorite, and sodium hypochlorite.

In one embodiment, the whitening agent comprises a peroxide compound. As referred to herein, a “peroxide compound” is an oxidizing compound comprising a bivalent oxygen-oxygen group. Peroxide compounds include peroxides and hydroperoxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals, organic peroxy compounds, peroxy acids, pharmaceutically-acceptable salts thereof, and mixtures thereof. Peroxides of alkali and alkaline earth metals include lithium peroxide, potassium peroxide, sodium peroxide, magnesium peroxide, calcium peroxide, barium peroxide, and mixtures thereof. Organic peroxy compounds include carbamide peroxide (also known as urea hydrogen peroxide), glyceryl hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxides, dialkyl peroxides, alkyl peroxy acids, peroxy esters, diacyl peroxides, benzoyl peroxide, and monoperoxyphthalate, and mixtures thereof. Peroxy acids and their salts include organic peroxy acids such as alkyl peroxy acids, and monoperoxyphthalate and mixtures thereof, as well as inorganic peroxy acid salts such as persulfate, dipersulfate, percarbonate, perphosphate, perborate and persilicate salts of alkali and alkaline earth metals such as lithium, potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium and barium, and mixtures thereof. In various embodiments, the peroxide compound comprises hydrogen peroxide, urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate and mixtures thereof.

Peroxide releasing compounds particularly useful in the whitening compositions of the present invention include peroxide containing compounds such as urea peroxide, sodium percarbonate, sodium perborate and polyvinylpyrrolidone-H202complexes (hereinafter “PVP-H202”). Polyvinylpyrrolidone is also known as poly-N-vinyl-poly-2-pyrrolidone and commonly abbreviated to “PVP”. PVP generally refers to a polymer containing vinylpyrrolidone (also referred to as N-vinylpyrrolidone, N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidione and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidinone) as a monomeric unit. The monomeric unit consists of a polar imide group, four non-polar methylene groups and a non-polar methane group.

Both linear and cross-linked complexes of PVP-H202are known in the art and are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,376,110 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,480,557, which are herein incorporated by reference, and have been used in compositions for treating acne vulgaris (U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,370). PVP-H202complexes are also disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,122,370. PVP-H202is stable in an anhydrous environment. Upon exposure to highly aqueous environments, such as in the oral cavity, the PVP-H202dissociates into individual species (PVP polymer and H202). In one embodiment, the PVP-H202complex is about 80% by weight polyvinylpyrrolidone and 20% by weight H202.

In alternate embodiments, the whitening agent comprises a liquid peroxide solution. The hydrophobic polymer carrier of the whitening composition provides sufficient stability to permit the use of a liquid hydrogen peroxide. The liquid hydrogen peroxide comprises H2O2generally contained in an aqueous water-based solution. In some embodiments, the liquid hydrogen peroxide has a concentration of peroxide to the total solution of about 0.5 to about 10%, more preferably 0.5 to 5% by weight). Additionally, a stabilizer may be present. For example, a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution with about 0.1 to about 0.5% of a stabilizer may be used. Acetanilide or a similar organic material can also be used with a pyrophosphate stabilizer such as sodium acid pyrophosphate (about 0.1 to about 1.0%) with a preferred amount of about 0.5%.

In certain embodiments, an agent to enhance release of the peroxide in the oral cavity is present as a part of the peroxide component whitening agent. Polypore® which is an allyl methacrylate crosspolymer available from Amcol health & Beauty Solutions, Inc. is such an enhancing agent.

In various embodiments, the whitening agent of the whitening composition comprises from about 0.1% to about 50%, optionally from about 1% to about 40%, and optionally from about 10% to about 30% of the oral care composition.

Hydrophobic Polymer Carrier

The present invention preferably comprises a carrier that comprises a hydrophobic polymer. The term “hydrophobic” or “water-insoluble” as applied to polymers and as employed herein refers to an organic polymer which is substantially non-aqueous having a water solubility of less than one gram per 100 grams of water at 25° C. Any such polymers that are compatible with the whitening agents previously described above, and which can produce a tooth whitening composition having a viscosity of greater than about 1,000 centipoise (cP) and less than about 900,000 cP, preferably greater than about 10,000 cP and less than about 100,000 cP, more preferably greater than 50,000 cP and less than 900,000 cP, and most preferably from between about 200,000 cP to about 600,000 cP, are preferred in various embodiments of the present invention.

One preferred class of hydrophobic polymers comprise siloxane polymers, which are also generally known in the art as “silicone” polymers. In certain embodiments of the present invention, the hydrophobic polymers in the carrier are those in which a whitening agent can be dispersed and are well known in the art. Many such silicone polymers are commercially available. In various embodiments, a preferred silicone-based hydrophobic polymer is a polyorganosiloxane. One such polyorganosiloxane is produced by condensing a silicone resin and an organosiloxane such as a polydiorganosiloxane. Such hydrophobic polymers are an elastomeric, tacky material, adhesion of which to dental enamel surfaces can be varied by altering the ratio of silicone resin to polydiorganosiloxane in the copolymer molecule. Preferably, the polymers are pressure sensitive hydrophobic polymers specifically designed for pharmaceutical use and are permeable to many drug compounds and find application for the transdermal application of various compounds. In one such embodiment, the silicone polymers are the copolymer product of mixing a silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane such as polydimethyl siloxane with a silanol-containing silicone resin whereby the silanol groups of the polydiorganosiloxane undergo a condensation reaction with the silanol groups of the silicone resin so that the polydiorganosiloxane is lightly crosslinked by the silicone resin (that is, the polydiorganosiloxane chains are bonded together through the resin molecules to give chain branching and entanglement and/or a small amount of network character) to form the silicone hydrophobic polymers. A catalyst, for example, an alkaline material, such as ammonia, ammonium hydroxide or ammonium carbonate, can be mixed with the silanol-terminated polydiorganosiloxane and the silicone resin to promote this crosslinking reaction. By copolymerizing the silicone resin with the silanol terminated polydiorganosiloxane, there results a polymer with self adhering properties and the cohesive properties of a soft elastomer matrix characteristic of pressure sensitive polymers being distinguished from the hard, non-elastomeric properties of other silicone resins. In one embodiment, hydrophobic polymers used in the carrier are available from the Dow-Corning Company under the brand name BIO-PSA.

The modification of a ratio of silicone resin to polydiorganosiloxane modifies the tackiness of the hydrophilic polymer. This ratio can be in the range of about 70:30 to about 50:50. For example, the BIO PSA silicone sold by Dow-Corning is available in three silicone resin to silicone polymer ratios namely, 65/35 (low tack), 60/40 (medium tack), 55/45 (high tack). Such a polyorganosiloxane pressure sensitive adhesive is available dissolved in either ethyl acetate solvent or dimethicone.

In various embodiments, the hydrophobic polymer carrier is present in the liquid whitening compositions of the present invention at a concentration of about 1 to about 80% by weight and preferably about 15 to about 40% by weight.

Adhesion Enhancing Agents

In one embodiment of the present invention, the whitening composition further comprises an adhesion enhancing agent, that augments adhesion of the anhydrous whitening composition to the surface of the tooth, i.e., adhesion to the enamel. Adhesion enhancing agents useful with the present invention include inorganic materials as well as organic natural and synthetic polymers. Inorganic materials include amorphous silica compounds which function as thickening agents, and include colloidal silica compounds available under trademarks such as Cab-o-sil fumed silica manufactured by Cabot Corporation and distributed by Lenape Chemical, bound Brook, N.J.; Zeodent 165 from J.M. Huber Chemicals Division, Havre de Grace, Md. 21078; and Sylox 15 also known as Sylodent 15, available from Davison Chemical Division of W.R. Grace Corporation, Baltimore, Md. 21203. In certain embodiments, the inorganic adhesion enhancing material, such as silica, is surface treated to compatibilize the adhesion enhancing agent with the hydrophobic components in the whitening system.

Organic materials which may be included in the compositions of the present invention to enhance the properties of the hydrophobic polymers of the present invention include adhesion enhancing agents such as waxes, inclusive of bees' wax, mineral oil, plastigel, (a blend of mineral oil and polyethylene), petrolatum, white petrolatum, shellac, versagel (blend of liquid paraffin, butene/ethylene/styrene hydrogenated copolymer) polyethylene waxes, microcrystalline waxes, polyisobutene, polyvinyl pyrrolidone/vinyl acetate copolymers, and insoluble polyacrylate copolymers.

Also effective as adhesion enhancing agents are liquid hydrophilic polymers including polyethylene glycols, nonionic polymers of ethylene oxide having the general formula:
HOCH2(CH2OCH2)nCH2OH
wherein n represents the average number of oxyethylene groups. Polyethylene glycols available from Dow Chemical are designated by a number such as 200, 300, 400, 600, 2000 which represents the approximate average molecular weight of the polymer, as well as nonionic block copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide of the formula:
HO(CH4O)a(C3H6O)b(C2H4O)cH
The block copolymer is preferably chosen (with respect to a, b and c) such that the ethylene oxide constituent comprises from about 65 to about 75% by weight, of the copolymer molecule and the copolymer has an average molecular weight of from about 2,000 to about 15,000 with the copolymer being present in the liquid tooth whitening composition in such concentration that the composition is liquid at room temperatures (23° C.).

A particularly desirable block copolymer for use in the practice of the present invention is available commercially from BASF and designated Pluraflo L1220 which has an average molecular weight of about 9,800. The hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) block averages about 65% by weight of the polymer.

Adhesion enhancing agents employed in compositions of various embodiments of the invention are present in an amount of from about 0 to about 20% by weight. Preferably, the adhesion enhancing agents are present in an amount of from about 2 to about 15% by weight.

Additional Ingredients

As previously described, many other components may further be included in the whitening compositions of the present invention, and include flavors, sweetening agents, surfactants, anti-microbial agents, anti-inflammatory agents, plaque buffers, vitamins, anti-caries agents, anti-plaque agents, desensitizing agents, coloring agents, pigments and opacifying agents, for example.

In certain embodiments, nonionic surfactants are present in the whitening composition. These surfactants are preferably compatible with the whitening agents and serve as solubilizing, dispersing, emulsifying and wetting agents. In one aspect, surfactants are especially effective to solubilize a flavoring agent, if flavor is desired for the liquid whitening composition. A particularly useful nonionic surfactant is a water soluble polyoxyethylene monoester of sorbitol with a C10 to C18 fatty acid, marketed commercial under the Tween trademark. The Tween surfactants are mixtures of C10 to C18 fatty acid esters of sorbitol (and sorbitol anhydrides), consisting predominately of the monoester, condensed with about 10-30, preferably about 20, moles of ethyleneoxide. The fatty acid (aliphatic hydrocarbonyl monocarboxylic acid) may be saturated or unsaturated, e.g., lauric, palmitic, stearic, oleic acids. Polysorbate 20 (e.g., Tween 20) is especially preferred and is commonly referred to as polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monolaurate. The nonionic surfactant constitutes about 0 to 50% by weight and preferably 0.5 to 40% by weight of the liquid composition.

In an embodiment where the whitening composition has a flavoring agent, the flavoring agent is selected from essential oils, as well as various flavoring aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and similar materials. Examples of the essential oils include oils of spearmint, peppermint, wintergreen, sassafras, clove, sage, eucalyptus, marjoram, cinnamon, lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange. Also useful are such chemicals as menthol, carvone, and anethole. Of these, the most commonly employed are the oils of peppermint, spearmint and wintergreen. The flavoring agent is preferably incorporated in the whitening composition of the present embodiment at a concentration of about 0 to about 2% by weight and more preferably about 0.1 to about 0.5% by weight.

In embodiments where the whitening composition is sweetened, a sweetening material is used as an alternative or complement to the flavoring agent. Suitable sweetening agents are water-soluble and include sodium saccharin, sodium cyclamate, xylitol, perillartien, D-tryptophan, aspartame, dihydrochalcones and the like, in concentrations of about 0.01 to about 1% by weight. Sodium saccharin is preferred.

Other ingredients which are included in various embodiments of the liquid whitening composition comprise materials commonly used in the oral care formulations. These include: antimicrobial agents, e.g., Triclosan, chlorhexidine, copper-, zinc- and stannous salts such as zinc citrate, zinc sulphate, zinc glycinate, sodium zinc citrate and stannous pyrophosphate, sanguinarine extract, metronidazole, quaternary ammonium compounds, such as cetylpyridinium chloride; bis-guanides, such as chlorhexidine digluconate, hexetidine, octenidine, alexidine; and halogenated bisphenolic compounds, such as 2,2′ methylenebis-(4-chloro-6-bromophenol); antiinflammatory agents such as ibuprofen, flurbiprofen, aspirin, indomethacine; anticaries agents such as sodium-, calcium-, magnesium- and stannous fluoride, aminefluorides, disodium monofluorophosphate and sodium trimetaphosphate; plaque buffers such as urea, calcium lactate, calcium glycerophosphate and strontium polyacrylates; vitamins such as Vitamin C; plant extracts; desensitizing agents, e.g., potassium citrate, potassium chloride, potassium tartrate, potassium bicarbonate, potassium oxalate, potassium nitrate and strontium salts; agents effective against dental calculus such as pyrophosphate salts including the mono, di, tri and tetra alkali metal and ammonium pyrophosphate and tripolyphosphate salts; biomolecules, e.g., bacteriocins, antibodies, enzymes such as papain, glucoamylase; opacifying agents, pigments, coloring agents and fluoride ion providing salts having anticaries efficacy such as sodium fluoride, potassium fluoride, a tin fluoride such as stannous fluoride.

Dental Trays

In various embodiments of the present invention, the teeth whitening system comprises a dental tray operable to conform to the surface of a tooth or plurality of teeth. The tooth whitening composition can be applied to the surface of the dental tray by manual application, such as by painting. Thus, the dental tray is operable to retain whitening composition and to be inserted into the oral cavity. Further, the dental tray preferably has one or more surfaces that are operable to confront at least one surface of a tooth that is to be whitened.

Dental trays are well-known in the art. A dental tray can be generic (e.g., off-the-shelf) or custom designed for the subject (human or other animal) with which it is to be used. In either type of dental tray, a surface of the tray is contacted with the tooth (usually with multiple teeth), and the whitening composition is permitted to bathe or coat the tooth/teeth. The dental tray will fit within a subject's mouth, and may cover all of the upper or lower teeth or a portion thereof. In certain embodiments, one dental tray may fit over both the upper and lower teeth, such as a mouth guard typically worn by athletes. The dental tray comprises a tooth bed or reservoir formed between an inner and an outer sidewall. The teeth are placed into the tooth bed. The outer sidewall will accordingly be disposed between the outer surface of the teeth and a patient's cheeks, and the inner sidewall will be disposed between the inner surface of the patient's teeth and the mouth cavity. Dental trays designed to simultaneously fit over the upper and lower teeth preferably include air passages to permit the wearer of the dental tray to breathe.

The dental tray can be of any conventional form and made from conventionally used thermoplastic polymers. Thermoset polymers also can be used. Consequently, the tray can range from highly flexible to a low flexibility. The thermoplastic polymers useful in various embodiments of the present invention include polyethylene and polypropylene polymers their derivatives and copolymers, silicone elastomers, polyurethanes and derivatives, polycaprolactams, polystyrene and derivatives, polybutadiene and derivatives, polyisoprene and derivatives, and polymethacrylate and its derivatives. These can be in a sheet, foam or a laminate form. In forming a customized dental tray, a cast is taken of the teeth and gum area of a patient and set. A thermoplastic polymer film is placed over the cast and vacuum formed to the shape of the teeth and gum margin of the patient. In this manner, a tray in the shape of the teeth having a reservoir or bed that can contain a whitening formulation is formed, and can thus be used to treat the patient's teeth.

In one embodiment, the whitening composition is applied by the end-user (a consumer or dental care professional) to the surfaces of the dental tray prior to use, such that the whitening composition contacts the surfaces of the teeth to be whitened. In an alternate embodiment, the whitening composition may be applied to the dental tray and shipped to the end-user with the whitening composition contained in a storage reservoir.

Tooth Whitening Kit

In an embodiment according to the present invention, a tooth whitening kit is provided, for whitening the surface of a tooth in the oral cavity of a human or other animal subject, comprising a dental tray operable for insertion into the oral cavity of the subject comprising a reservoir. Such a dental tray may be selected to correspond to any of the embodiments described above or of those known to one of skill in the art. The tooth whitening kit further comprises a tooth whitening composition comprising a peroxide whitening agent and a hydrophobic siloxane polymer carrier having a viscosity of at least about 50,000 centipoise. In one embodiment, the tooth whitening kit may be employed to the surface of a tooth in the oral cavity of a human or other animal subject using the kit described above, where the whitening composition is applied to the reservoir in the dental tray of the kit and the tray is then inserted into the oral cavity so that the whitening composition is contacted with the surface of the tooth.

Methods

In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method of whitening the surface of a tooth in the oral cavity of a human or other animal subject using a tooth whitening system comprising a dental tray having a surface operable to confront a tooth surface, and a tooth whitening composition comprising a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier. The method comprises applying the composition to the dental tray and inserting the tray into the oral cavity so that the composition is contacted with the surface of the tooth. The contacting occurs for a duration of time sufficient to satisfactorily effect whitening of the teeth. Thus, the contacting occurs for a sufficient period of time to at least partially whiten teeth. This can be a period of time from about 0.5 hour to 2 hours or longer. The substantially non-aqueous tooth whitening composition is effective over a longer period of time, since it is not significantly diluted or removed from the dental tray during the treatment time.

In another embodiment, a method of whitening a surface of a tooth is provided comprising contacting the surface with a whitening composition contained in a dental tray, where the whitening composition comprises a whitening agent and a hydrophobic polymer carrier. In certain embodiments, before the contacting, a dental tray is formed that substantially conforms to a surface of a tooth, or a plurality of teeth, to be whitened. Further, after the contacting, the method comprises removing the dental tray from the surface of the tooth and then treating the surface of the tooth with a desensitizing composition in certain embodiments. The tooth desensitizing formulation can be applied via use of the dental tray. In alternate embodiments, the desensitizing composition is applied via use of a desensitizing toothpaste for several days after the whitening procedure. Such desensitizing formulations preferably contain at least one of the following: potassium nitrate, citric acid, citric acid salts, strontium chloride and the like. A process where the tooth whitening procedure is followed by a tooth desensitizing procedure is preferred for subjects who are susceptible to tooth sensitivity problems.

The liquid whitening compositions of the present invention are prepared by adding and mixing the ingredients of the composition in a suitable vessel such as a stainless steel tank provided with a mixer. In the preparation of the liquid whitening composition, the ingredients are advantageously added to the mixer in the following order: liquid anhydrous silicone based pressure sensitive polymer (hydrophobic polymer carrier), peroxide whitening agent, adhesion enhancing agent and any desired flavoring or sweetener. The ingredients are then mixed to form a homogeneous dispersion/solution. The moisture content of the tooth whitening composition will be about 0.05% by weight to about 10% by weight, and preferably about 2% by weight to about 8% by weight. The viscosity of such a composition is about 50,000 centipoise to about 900,000 centipoise and preferably about 200,000 centipoise to about 600,000 centipoise.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed to a method of applying a tooth whitening composition to teeth and an applicator to be used in this method.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Tooth whitening products are applied in different ways. A common technique is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to ones teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with the latter technique is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative affect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition if a person washes the brush each time after use moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

These problems require a better way to deliver the whitening composition to the teeth. The objective is to maintain the supply of whitening composition segregated from the general environment and from mouth saliva. This objective has to be fulfilled using a dispenser that is easy to use by a person to apply the whitening composition to his/her teeth and is gentle on the teeth and gums. Additionally in a preferred embodiment the dispenser should be readily portable.

The present invention addresses and solves these problems. Preferred dispensers are elongated and pen-like in shape. They can contain about 0.5 ml to 20 ml of a product in the body portion and they have an applicator end for applying the contained tooth whitening compositions to a person's teeth. The applicator end is constructed such that moisture and saliva components will not migrate from an applicator surface into the part of the dispenser where the whitening composition is stored. In addition the applicator components must be compatible with the whitening compositions.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This invention comprises a method for applying a tooth whitening composition to a persons teeth, and in one preferred embodiment an anhydrous tooth whitening composition. This latter composition must be maintained substantially anhydrous prior to an application to a persons teeth. In addition all compositions must be maintained free from catalase contamination during use. This requires a dispenser that is to be used for multiple treatments to maintain the stored whitening composition substantially segregated from the application surface throughout the multiple treatments. The method comprises using a dispenser having a body portion and a dispensing portion. The body portion has a cavity to contain about 0.5 ml to about 20 ml of a tooth whitening composition. At one end there is at least one aperture for the dispensing of the tooth whitening composition to an applicator. The aperture, (and collectively when there is a plurality of apertures) has a cross-sectional of area less than about 10 sq. mm, preferably less than about 5 sq. mm, and most preferably less than about 2 sq. mm. Further a channel from the body portion to the applicator surface has a length of more than about 5 mm, preferably more than about 10 mm, and most preferably more than about 15 mm. At the other end of the body portion of the dispenser is a piston to dispense the tooth whitening composition through the channel to the applicator surface. This is manually operated by a twisting motion or by a push button.

The apertures in a preferred embodiment have an associated application surface to apply the anhydrous tooth whitening composition to ones teeth. This can consist of bristles, a pad, a sponge-like surface or fibrillated surface. The size of the apertures and the length of the channel will preclude the migration of catalase and moisture into the body of the dispenser during each dispensing and subsequent to the dispensing.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, having a handle constructed of multiple components and/or materials.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, are mass-produced articles and must therefore allow cost-effective production. Toothbrushes made of a single plastic material and toothbrushes made of two plastic components, which are produced for example by a two component injection molding process, are known. In the latter case, known toothbrushes generally comprise two parts: a first part made of a hard plastic material, for example polypropylene; and a second part made of a resilient plastic material, for example a thermoplastic elastomer. Typically, the first part, which is made of the hard plastic material, forms the structural portion of the handle and has a recess or channel formed therein. This recess is filled with the resilient plastic material, thereby forming the second part which acts as a gripping surface or cover.

The hard plastic and the resilient soft plastic are selected so that they bond with one another at the surface where the two plastic parts touch. In comparison with a toothbrush made of only one plastic material, this provides greater scope for design. Since, however, the two plastic materials have to bond with one another during the injection-molding operation, there are restrictions in the selection of the plastic materials and consequently in the design of the toothbrush.

One solution to the limitation that two plastic materials must bond with one another during the injection molding operation has been introduced by which a handle can be formed by two plastics that do not chemically bond within one another during the injection molding operation but rather utilize a mechanical connection, such as by inter-fitting portions of the two plastic components or by shrinking one plastic component about the other. With respect to creating a two component toothbrush having a grip cover over a hard plastic body, this known method is limited in its design capability to a tubular sleeve that receives a cylindrical core structure within its cavity so as to circumferentially surround the entire circumference of the cylindrical core structure. This arrangement is limiting in both possible designs for the handle and the fact that the resulting handle must either be bulky or sacrifice strength.

Another oral care implement having a multi-component handle that is known in the art includes a gripping region having a thermoplastic elastomer (“TPE”) grip surface with a plurality of spaced slot openings exposing portions of a hard plastic base. This handle also includes an inclined portion and a soft TPE grip body extending through the hard plastic base of the handle to form opposite finger grips on the inclined portion of the handle.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes, that include movable cleaning features.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems, kits and methods, and specifically to a system, kit and method including a toothbrush having an open cavity that retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to ones teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with a fluid, such as an oral care product or agent, dispenser in a highly portable and convenient housing. Advantageously, such embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush having an open cavity in its handle that retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care system includes a fluid with oral care agents, either active or non-active, that may include without limitation whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other agents. The dispenser can be detachably docked and stored at least partially within the handle of the toothbrush so that a gripping portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush for access to a user permitting easy removal and use of the dispenser. In some embodiments, the dispenser is configured as and forms a removable portion of the handle itself. The dispenser can be completely removable from the toothbrush in certain embodiments so that the user can apply the oral care agent to his/her teeth with ease, and then reinsert the dispenser in the toothbrush for convenient storage. In certain embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component. The toothbrush can removably and non-fixedly secure the dispenser within the handle so that the dispenser can be repetitively removed and reinserted therein. In some embodiments, the dispenser may be adapted to be user-refillable for repeated use.

According to one embodiment of the present invention, an oral care system includes a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush. In some embodiments, the dispenser may form a constituent portion of a handle of the toothbrush. The dispenser may include a housing having an internal reservoir configured for containing a fluid, a dispensing orifice in the housing in fluid communication with the reservoir, and a fluid delivery system. The fluid delivery system may be a ratcheting type dispensing system in one embodiment including a ratchet rod extending into the reservoir, an actuator operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting movement thereto, and a two-piece plunger assembly operably coupled to the ratchet rod and axially movable within the housing by activation of the actuator. The plunger assembly forms a selectively-positionable transverse end wall of the reservoir, which in some embodiments is movable or advanceable only in a single axial direction. The plunger assembly includes an outer cup seal slidably engaged with the housing and an inner plunger disposed at least partially in the cup seal. The plunger also includes a pawl movably engaged with ratchet rod, wherein activation of the actuator moves the plunger assembly in a first direction and dispenses the fluid from the reservoir via the orifice.

According to one embodiment of the present invention, an oral care system includes a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush. The dispenser includes a housing having a distal dispensing end, a proximal actuating end, and an internal reservoir configured for containing a fluid defined therebetween. A dispensing orifice may be disposed in the distal dispensing end of the housing in fluid communication with the reservoir for delivering the oral care fluid. The dispenser further includes a fluid delivery system including a ratchet rod extending into the reservoir, a resiliently deformable actuator disposed on the actuating end of the housing and operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting movement thereto, and a plunger assembly operably coupled to the ratchet rod and axially movable within the housing in a first direction by activation of the actuator. The plunger assembly forms a selectively-positionable end wall of the reservoir. In some embodiments, the actuator may be formed of a self-biasing elastomeric material having an elastic memory and being biased towards the operating end of the housing. Depressing the actuator deforms and partially collapses the actuator inwards and moves the ratchet rod and plunger assembly together in the first direction and dispenses the fluid from the reservoir via the orifice. Releasing the actuator causes the actuator to reassume an un-depressed and undeformed position under the self-biasing force of the actuator material elastic memory. This retracts the ratchet rod in a second direction opposite the first. The plunger assembly remains stationary in an advanced axial position.

A method for dispensing an oral care product from an oral care system is also provided. In one embodiment, the method includes: providing an oral care system including a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably mounted to the toothbrush, the dispenser including a distal dispensing end, a proximal operating end, and reservoir containing an oral care product. The dispenser may further include a ratcheting fluid dispensing mechanism including: a ratchet rod axially movable within the housing; a resiliently deformable push button formed of an elastomeric material and operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting motion thereto, the push button having an elastic memory and being self-biased towards an undeformed inactive position; and a plunger assembly axially slidable within the housing and including a pawl operably coupled to the ratchet rod, the plunger assembly forming a movable end wall of the reservoir. The method further includes the steps of: detaching the dispenser from toothbrush; depressing the push button, wherein the push button becomes activated and deformed; moving the ratchet rod and plunger assembly together in a first distal axial direction wherein the plunger assembly is moved from a first position to a second position and oral care product is dispensed; releasing the push button, wherein the push button is returned to the undeformed inactive position under the self-biasing force of the push button; and retracting the ratchet rod in a second proximal direction, wherein the plunger assembly remains stationary in the second position.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to antimicrobial compositions containing a borinic acid derivative, e.g. a borinic ester. In particular embodiments, the invention covers oral compositions, for example dentifrice, for reducing bacteria in the mouth, e.g. for inhibiting and reducing plaque, gingivitis and dental caries.

Although some borinic esters are effective as antibacterial agents, incorporating borinic esters into oral care compositions presents difficulties, as borinic esters have proven to be unstable when added to aqueous compositions. For example, borinic esters may hydrolyze and decompose, e.g., in oral care compositions. Additionally, borinic esters may be insoluble in aqueous compositions. For example, the solubility of 3-hydroxypyridine-2-carbonyloxy-bis(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-borane in water is only 100 ppm, and its solubility in various oils may be less than 0.5%. There remains a need to develop compositions and methods to incorporate borinic acid derivatives stably in oral care compositions.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to the surprising discovery that certain borinic esters are stable, soluble, and retain antimicrobial activity when incorporated into an oral care composition, e.g., a dentifrice or mouthwash.

In one embodiment, the borinic acid derivatives of the present invention are borinic esters, e.g. of formula A:


wherein R1and R2are the same or different (e.g. the same), and are selected from arylalkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, or heterocycle (e.g. substituted or unsubstituted aryl or heteroaryl, for example phenyl, chlorophenyl, methylphenyl, or methylchlorophenyl); and R3is heteroaryl, heteroarylalkyl, heteroarylcarbonyl, or heteroarylalkylcarbonyl (e.g., substituted or unsubstituted heteroaryl, for example quinolinyl or hydroxypyridinylcarbonyl), in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. For example, in one embodiment R1and R2are the same and are both aryl, e.g., phenyl, chlorophenyl, methylphenyl, or methylchlorophenyl.

Heteroaryl is for example an aryl group containing 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen atoms, for example pyridinyl, quinolinyl, hydroxypyridinyl, or hydroxyquinolinyl. Alkyl is for example C1-4alkyl. Substitutions are for example halogen, e.g., chloro or fluoro, hydroxy, or C1-4alkyl.

The borinic esters useful in the present invention thus include, for example, (i) boron picolinates, e.g. diaryl boron picolinates, for example 3-hydroxypyridine-2-carbonyloxy-bis(3-chloro-4-methylphenyl)-borane or 3-hydroxypyridine-2-carbonyloxy-bis(2-methyl-4-chlorophenyl)-borane, as well as (ii) diaryl borinic esters, for example diphenylborane-8-hydroxyquinolinate (PBHQ).

Compounds of Formula 1 may exist in rotameric form, and the illustrated dative bond (arrow) may or may not be present, i.e., the present invention includes those compounds in which coordination between the boron atom and the nitrogen or hydroxy of the picolinate is present and those compounds where such coordination is missing. The present invention also includes those compounds of Formula 1 in which a dative bond is formed between the boron and another atom of the molecule. In addition, those of skill in the art, e.g., organic and medicinal chemistry, will appreciate that the large difference in atomic radius between carbon and boron can allow for the formation of solvent coordination complexes in which a solvent molecule, such as water, can be inserted between the boron atom and the nitrogen atom of the picolinate ring.

It has surprisingly been discovered that in formulations, the borinic ester compounds may exist in rotameric form, wherein the form is largely pH dependent, and the boron may be linked by a coordinate covalent bond (dative bond) to the nitrogen in the heteroaryl. The rotamer wherein the boron is nonpolar or associated with the hydroxy group on the picolinate moiety is predominantly or exclusively present at basic pH, while the more polar rotamer, wherein the boron is associated with the nitrogen on the picolinate or other heterocycle predominates at acidic pH. For example,


It has also been discovered that the nonpolar rotamer or rotamer wherein the boron is associated with hydroxy is more stable in formulation. Without intending to be bound by theory, it is believed that the shift in electron density that occurs upon the formation of the dative bond with nitrogen makes the polar isomer more susceptible to hydrolysis at the ester bond.

To favor the more stable rotamer, we have discovered that it is advantageous that the pH of the formulation be maintained above 7, e.g., by using a buffer to prevent a drop in pH which would result in formation of the more polar rotamer, and/or that the pH be maintained even at a higher level, e.g., 8-9.5, it having been surprisingly shown that the compounds are stable at higher pH, and not (as might be suspected) highly vulnerable to degradation by OH−ions. This discovery allows preparation of stable aqueous formulations of the compounds. We note that this discovery is somewhat in contrast to the examples of WO 2006/102604 which describe topical emulsions, with the borinic ester in the oil phase, or else compositions having relatively low pH, e.g., 5.5.

Thus, the invention provides Composition 1.0, a composition, e.g., an oral care composition, comprising an antibacterially effective amount of a borinic acid derivative, e.g., of Formula A, for example a compound of Formula (I), having a pH of at least 8, e.g. 8.5-11, for example about 9, or buffered to at least pH 7, and optionally further comprising one or more antioxidants, surfactants and solubilizing agents.

The present invention includes Composition 2.0, a dentifrice, comprising Composition 1.0 and a dentifrice vehicle, having a pH of at least 8, e.g. 8.5-11, for example about 9, or buffered to at least pH 7, and optionally further comprising one or more antioxidants, surfactants and/or solubilizing agents.

In another aspect, it has been discovered that borinic acid derivatives, e.g. of Formula A, which are often difficult to solubilize, are highly soluble in polymers comprising polyoxyethylene or polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene. Thus in another embodiment the present invention comprises Composition 3.0, an oral care composition, e.g., according to any of Compositions 1.0 to 2.0, comprising borinic acid derivatives, e.g. of Formula A, for example a Compound of Formula I, and a solubilizing agent, e.g., selected from polymers of polyoxyethylene and polyoxyethylene/polyoxypropylene.

It has also been found that buffering the formulation enhances stability. The invention thus provide provides Composition 4.0, an oral care formulation comprising an antibacterially effective amount of a borinic acid derivative, e.g., of Formula A, for example a compound of Formula (I), for example any of Compositions 1.0 et seq.-3.0 et seq. more fully described below, in combination with a suitable buffer, for example a phosphate buffer.

The present invention also includes Method 5.0, a method for preparing an oral care composition comprising mixing any of Compositions 1.0-4.0 with an orally acceptable vehicle and adjusting or maintaining the pH at a level of at least 7, preferably at least 8, e.g., 8.5-11.

The present invention also includes Method 6.0, a method to reduce, inhibit, or treat oral microbial infections, for example to reduce or inhibit formation of dental caries, to treat, reduce or inhibit gingivitis, to reduce levels of oral bacteria, to inhibit microbial biofilm formation in the oral cavity, to reduce plaque accumulation, and/or clean the teeth and oral cavity, comprising applying a Composition of the Invention to the oral cavity of a subject in need thereof.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a toothbrush and more particularly to a toothbrush head construction wherein the head is designed and configured to yield a brushing surface conforming to curved sections of teeth and which is bendable to conform to straight teeth sections.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Prior toothbrush constructions include toothbrush heads having pivoted or articulated sections joined together in a variety of constructions, such as a resilient strip of metal or the likes and also include pivoted or hinged articulated sections to provide a curved bristle configuration.

A curved/angled bristle surface configuration offers improved access to hard-to-reach areas such as the lingual surfaces of the front teeth and behind the rear molars, placing more bristles in contact with the outer surfaces of the front teeth.

Many current brushes which have rigidly mounted bristles and a rigid curved/angled bristle surface exhibit an inherent disadvantage when brushing both flat as well as concave tooth surfaces. Placing a curved/angled bristle surface on flat tooth surfaces results in fewer bristles making contact with the teeth. These fewer bristles must support the brushing forces applied through the handle, which will result in premature splaying of the bristles. Some current toothbrushes have a “power tip” configuration (elongated rigidly mounted tip bristles) which are claimed to have improved access benefits.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

According to the invention, an articulated toothbrush head is defined by two head sections joined by one or more thin bridges of the same resin from which the toothbrush is formed, as by molding, to produce an integral construction. These thin bridges permit limited flexing between the two head sections, the two sections normally being at a small angle with respect to each other. That portion of the head between the two head sections may be in one embodiment, in the general form of a T shaped slot running transversely of the top surface of the head, from one side head side edge to another. The slot is filled, as by injection, with an elastomer to control and enhance flexing. The construction is such that the head section most remote from the handle is normally tilted with respect to the head section nearest the handle, the latter head section located at one end of the handle. In a second embodiment, the head section may assume the form of a narrow cylindrical portion, or in a third embodiment two thin bridges may be employed, both having elastomer.

An advantage of the present flexible configuration is, in addition to the above noted features of a curved configuration, its inherent gentleness on the gums. When one brushes along the gumline with a power tip configuration, one focuses much of the force through the concentrated area at the raised tip. With the present configuration, this force is more evenly distributed.

There are considerable manufacturing efficiencies with having the elastomer material of this invention used in the flex area being the same elastic material as that which may be used as a grip material in the handle area. Therefore, a configuration which allows flexing under the loads typically encountered during brushing with materials which are suitable for use as a grip would be desirable.

To achieve the flexibility described above, the cross section of elastomer may be convoluted, with one or more convolutes. To aid in fixing the elastomer to the toothbrush head sections, the elastomer may be configured to fit into one or more slots at both ends of the flexing area.

To minimize the gap between bristle tufts when the head is flexed into a flat configuration, it is desirable to position the plastic (resin) bridge between the tip and handle portions as near the bristle tips as possible. This bridge is straightened during flexing, and directly controls the gap between bristle tufts on each side of the flex area.

The present invention also provides a toothbrush including a handle and an articulated head coupled to the handle, the head including, two sections. Each of the head sections has a bottom surface and a side surface and each of the head sections includes a plurality of bristles extending from the bottom surface of that head section. In one embodiment, at least one of the head sections includes a plurality of elastomeric fingers partially defining the side surface of that head section and partially extending from the bottom surface of that head section. The head section most remote from the handle, in a normal configuration of the head, may be angled with respect to the other head section. The elastomeric fingers are adapted, for example, to provide a massaging action against the gums when the toothbrush is applied along the gumline and the elastomeric fingers are contacted with the gums.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having various features that may include a cleaner for cleaning soft tissue surfaces in a user's mouth, tooth cleaning or tooth treating elements, movable cleaning features, vibratory mechanisms, and/or handle gripping features, as well as methods for constructing the same.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean teeth by removing plaque and debris from surfaces of the teeth as well to clean gum tissue surrounding teeth. Conventional toothbrushes typically have a head having tufts of bristles and may also have other types of cleaning structures. A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and or mechanically driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning/polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which the cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the cleaning elements are attached.

Tongue scrapers exist as devices for removing micro debris disposed on a user's tongue. Conventional tongue scrapers are stand-alone devices directed to the singular purpose of scraping a user's tongue. These conventional devices typically include a handle and scraper portion without including other cleaning elements.

Users manipulate conventional toothbrushes and tongue scrapers by grasping their handle portions. The handles are typically simple, linear rods of a relatively rigid material, which are neither comfortable for the user nor given to easy manipulation. As these devices are commonly used in wet conditions, their handles are often slippery during use.

Many people use multiple oral care implements, such as toothbrushes and tongue scrapers, on a daily basis to accomplish multiple oral care tasks. For instance, a user may use a toothbrush to clean his teeth and then use a tongue scraper to remove debris from his tongue. The user may then re-use the toothbrush to further clean his tongue. Thus, the user may switch between various oral care implements during a single session in a wet environment.

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that provides several advantages and that may be used for multiple functions. According to aspects of the invention, an oral care implement can be provided that has a plurality of cleaning elements extending from the head including cleaning elements attached to a carrier that is flexibly attached to the head. The cleaning elements can include forward angled cleaning elements and/or rearward angled cleaning elements.

Oral care implement configurations according to the invention can be multi-functional and can include various features in advantageous combinations. Some configurations can include a soft tissue cleaner in combination with tooth cleaning features and/or in combination with gripping features on the handle that improve the user's grip and handling thereof. The configurations can be manual or mechanically-driven devices, or combinations thereof.

One oral care implement configuration according to aspects of the invention includes a head frame and a cleaning elements assembly attached thereto with tooth cleaning elements extending from carriers of the assembly. One or more central carriers can be suspended via a flexible bridge between a pair of support carriers of the assembly that can be attached to the head frame. The bridge can be formed from an elastomer that permits the one or more central carriers to move from an initial position toward the head frame during use. The carriers and the bridge can be formed as a unitary assembly attached to the head frame, such as via mechanical connections. The mechanical connections could include snap-fit connections.

"INTRODUCTION

The present invention relates to oral care compositions, particularly compositions for caries prevention.

Dental caries are caused by the production of acid by certain bacteria, includingStreptococcus mutans(hereinafterS. mutans).S. mutansproduces sticky, adhesive glucans and fructans from fermentable sugars, particularly sucrose, which promote the adhesion of bacteria to the oral surfaces. TheS. mutansmay be contained in a dental plaque—the soft material formed of a complex mass of bacteria in a polysaccharide matrix which surrounds the teeth. A cariogenic plaque containing a high proportion ofS. mutanscan often contain 2×108bacteria per mg wet weight and can rapidly convert fermentable sugars (sucrose, glucose, or fructose, for example) to generate enough acid to lower the pH of the plaque to 5.5 or lower.

Demineralization of enamel occurs in an oral environment having a low pH because the natural equilibrium between hydroxyapatite being dissolved from the enamel of teeth and hydroxyapatite being formed on or in the teeth from substances occurring naturally in the saliva is disrupted. While saliva can reduce the acidity of the oral environment and provide a continuing source of calcium and phosphate to the tooth enamel, which tends to remineralize the enamel and inhibit or reverse the carious process, once the acid attack causes sufficient progression of the demineralization, a full-fledged carious lesion develops. For further discussion, see U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,298, Gaffar, et al., issued Oct. 24, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 5,378,131 Greenberg, issued Jan. 3, 1995; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,255, Gaffar, et al. issued Feb. 18, 1992.

Current methods of preventing dental caries include fluoride treatments and other anti-cariogenic oral care compositions used as part of a personal or a professional oral care regimen. Other methods include inhibiting acid production by disrupting metabolism of theS. mutansto kill the cells. Nonetheless, caries are still a prevalent dental problem.

Thus, there is an ongoing need to provide anti-cariogenic oral care compositions. It would be desirable to provide an oral care composition that prevents cariogenic conditions and remineralizes demineralized enamel.

SUMMARY

The present invention relates to oral care compositions comprising xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt, where the xylitol and the calcium salt are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.

The present invention also provides methods of preventing or treating dental caries comprising administering a safe and effective amount of an oral care composition to the oral cavity of a subject, the composition comprising xylitol and a water-soluble calcium salt, where the xylitol and the calcium salt are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.

The present invention also provides oral care compositions comprising xylitol, calcium glycerophosphate and fluoride providing agents in anti-cariogenic amounts, where the xylitol and calcium glycerophosphate are present in a weight ratio of at least about 10:1.

It has been discovered that the compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over anti-caries compositions known in the art. Such advantages include providing an oral care composition highly effective to remineralize demineralized dental surfaces. Further uses, benefits, and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a substantially anhydrous detergent composition that contains an effective amount of an insoluble stabilizer, such as clay, in a dispersed particulate form.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Liquid detergents are often considered to be more convenient to employ than dry powdered or particulate products. They are readily measurable, rapidly dissolved in the wash water, capable of being easily applied in concentrated solutions or dispersions to soiled areas on garments to be laundered and are non-dusting. Additionally, the liquid detergents may include materials that could not stand drying operations without deterioration, which materials are often desirably employed in the manufacture of particulate detergent products.

In particular, liquid detergent ingredients such as enzymes, bleach (e.g. hydrogen peroxide) and alkalizing agents contribute greatly to the removal of stains and soils. Multiple enzymes are typically used in detergent formulations to deliver a wide range of stain removal. These enzymes include, but are not limited to proteases (for stains/soils containing proteins such as dairy or grass), lipases (for stains/soils containing lipids such as butter or make-up), amylases (for stains/soils containing starches such as potatoes or gravy), and cellulases (for stains/soils containing cellulose such as fruits or vegetables). Meanwhile, bleaches work effectively against non-fatty stains such as red wine or coffee. Higher alkalinity can be provided by sodium carbonate or percarbonate, which helps to counteract water hardness and increase detergency.

However, most laundry detergents do not deliver all three mechanisms of stain removal due to incompatibility and interactions of the components that deliver these chemistries, particularly because current detergent systems are water based, which presents a challenge in stabilizing such a system. For example, enzymes that are typically only stable at a pH level of 6-9 can be unstable in a large presence of water. Bleaches, based on sodium percarbonates or hydrogen peroxide, are also unstable in aqueous environments at an alkaline pH level.

One of the approaches to deliver all of the cleaning ingredients together is to develop a pourable and substantially anhydrous paste or slurry system, which includes suspended percarbonate and/or carbonate salts and enzymes. The substantially anhydrous system is beneficial because the sodium percarbonate and enzymes would be stable in the absence of water, and they remain inactive until the system is in contact with a wash liquor. Furthermore, the incorporation of these salts in a stable anhydrous composition also provides an option to meter and package the composition in a dissolvable pouch or container. A dosed and contained detergent composition that requires minimal handling is highly desirable by consumers.

Various attempts are well known in the prior art to produce stable anhydrous detergents. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,264,466 to Carleton et al. teaches liquid laundry detergents that contain a chain structure type clay that is selected from attapulgite, sepiolite and palygorskite clays as a suspending agent.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,901 to Moorfield et al., which teaches a fabric care composition comprising an organophilic clay, a functionalized oil and water to provide softness benefits to fabric.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,846,992 to Fonsny teaches a non-aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising a suspension of builder salt in a liquid nonionic surfactant. The stability of the composition is improved by the addition of small amounts of organophilic-modified clay. The stability is further enhanced by reducing the solid particulate matter to a particle size below about 15 microns.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,316,812 to Hancock et al. teaches a liquid detergent composition comprising a dispersion of solids that includes one or more builders and bleach. The solids have an average particle diameter of less than 10 microns. Suitable inorganic builders include phosphates, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, sodium hexametaphosphate and, preferably, sodium tripolyphosphate, carbonates (e.g. sodium carbonate), sodium bicarbonate and sodium sesquicarbonate, clays (e.g. kaolin, montmorillonites and sodium bentonite), sodium borate, sodium citrate sodium meta-silicate and nitrilotriacetic acid.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,661,280 to Ouhadi et al. teaches a liquid heavy duty laundry detergent composition comprising a suspension of builder salt in a liquid nonionic surfactant, and at least one additional suspension stabilizing agent that is selected from the following: quaternary ammonium compounds, phosphoric esters, modified clays and mixtures thereof.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,713 to Dixit et al. teaches a non-aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising a builder salt suspension in a liquid nonionic surfactant. The composition is stabilized against phase separation by the addition of small amounts of low density fillers, such as hollow plastic or glass microspheres.

The above references teach various means to stabilize liquid detergent ingredients with the addition of fillers, builders and/or salts. However, there remains a need to formulate a stable liquid anhydrous detergent composition with a high proportion of dispersed solid materials.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A substantially anhydrous detergent composition is provided comprising a liquid phase, a dispersed solid phase and a processed clay mixture to stabilize the composition. The composition is surprisingly stable during its long-term storage, with no phase separation and minimal activated oxygen loss.

"This invention is directed to a package that has a type of hologram image on at least a part of its exterior surface, and the process to produce this hologram image that has on the exterior surface of a package. More particularly, this invention is directed to producing a hologram image on paper, paperboard, plastics and related substrates that can be used to package products.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Holograms have been used to enhance the appearance of packages for many years. They have been formed on labels and substrates that are applied to and are used as a layer on the surface of packages, such as cartons. However, the conventional hologram image on packages is expensive and usually requires the production of a hologram containing laminate film and the bonding of this film to a package surface. This requires several processing steps and costly materials. It would be more efficient and less costly to form the hologram on the packaging material in line with the printing of other image and information onto the packaging material.

In U.S. Pat. No. 5,889,598 there is disclosed the printing of a hologram onto a surface followed by the printing of another image onto the same surface. The hologram design is embossed onto the surface followed by a metallizing of the hologram design surface, in turn followed by the cutting of the surface into sheets for subsequent printing of other image and information. This process requires the subsequent metallizing of the embossed hologram design. This metallizing is by a relatively slow vapor deposition process. U.S. Pat. No. 5,003,915 discloses the forming of a hologram directly onto the desired end product paper or other sheet material. However, after the embossing of a hologram design there is a required step of metallizing the hologram surface. This could be by vapor deposition to produce a reflective film or refractive layer onto the hologram. A protective layer can be coated over this hologram. U.S. Pat. No. 6,979,487 discloses the printing of textured pattern over a substrate. A reflective ink or foil can be deposited or laminated onto this textured pattern layer. This produces an effect of depth and dimensionality. This is interesting but does not disclose the production of a hologram. This process would be inoperable to produce a holographic image. U.S. Pat. No. 6,638,386 discloses the technique of forming a holographic image or a diffraction grating image onto a composite sheet and the subsequent attachment of this sheet to a substrate. This involves the operation of separately forming the hologram on a composite sheet and applying this composite sheet onto a substrate to produce the finished hologram on a package or other item. All of these processes have the differing drawbacks. However, all are less efficient than the holograms on a package surface produced by the present processes.

The present processes produce a hologram image directly on the package surface solely through printing steps. Further, no subsequent metallizing steps are required. Such steps which usually involve the vapor deposition of a metal, such as aluminum, onto a hologram surface are relatively slow as compared to printing techniques and require specialized equipment. In the present processes a hologram image is produced on a substrate solely through the use of printing techniques and equipment.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention comprises a hologram image directly on packaging material, and the process to produce this hologram image directly on the packaging material. The process comprises having a paper, paperboard or plastic surface, which in one embodiment can be a substantially white paperboard surface, coating onto at least a part of this surface a polymeric radiation curable coating that contains a particulate metal component, curing this polymeric radiation curable coating, coating the cured polymeric radiation curable coating containing the particulate metal with a radiation curable and substantially transparent polymer coating, contacting this radiation curable substantially transparent coating with the negative of a hologram on a shim, and at least partially curing the radiation curable coating while the shim carrying the negative of the hologram is in contact with this coating. The combination of these two coatings and the negative of the hologram produce a hologram image in the areas where there also is an underlying particulate metal coating. An effective hologram image is formed by the technique of at least partially curing the substantially transparent radiation curable coating while the shim is in contact with this coating.

In a preferred embodiment a substantially white paperboard stock comprising blanks for the production of carton comprising a blank for the production of cartons is in a first step coated over at least a part of its surface with a coating that contains a particulate metal, this coating is cured, one or more image and/or information layers are then coated onto the cured particulate metal coated layer and each cured, coating these image and/or in formation layers with a substantially transparent radiation curable coating, and contacting this substantially transparent radiation curable coating with a shim that contains the negative of a hologram, and at least partially curing the radiation curable coating while the shim is in contact with the radiation curable coating. In this preferred embodiment the coatings are applied to the paperboard stock using printing techniques. A preferred technique is the use of flexographic printing. However, other commercially available printing techniques and equipment can be used.

After the paper or paperboard stock has been printed and contains the hologram it is finished by forming it into a package. The paper or paperboard stock usually will be in the form of a continuous sheet. The paper or paperboard stock can be use directly to make packages or it can be formed into cartons. To make cartons the continuous sheet will be formed into individual carton blanks. The carton blanks are shipped to the place where a product is to be packaged and placed in the magazine of a carton making and filling machine. The cartons containing a product are filled with a product, sealed and then usually placed in corrugated shipping cartons.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to ansate oral care implements, and specifically to toothbrushes, either manual or powered, that have a handle and a head having cleaning elements for oral cleaning.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes provided with a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice is often spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process and to hold the dentifrice in place during brushing, the industry continues to pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the preceding technology.

In an early attempt at improving the cleaning elements, toothbrushes were developed having two or three circular brush sections which are arranged within holders that may be screwed into mating receptacles in the tooth brush handle so that they can be removed and replaced as needed. Each brush section contains stiff cleaning elements and is spaced from the other along the longitudinal axis of the handle at a distance less than the thickness of a tooth so that the brush operates on both the lingual (inside) and facial (outside) surfaces of the teeth.

Another existing toothbrush includes a head containing a flexible, rubber-like prophylaxis polishing cup or “prophy cup” similar to that used by dental personnel to professionally clean teeth. This prophy cup is loaded with toothpaste by the user and applied to the teeth. The “soft rubber-like prophy cup device follows the contours of teeth more effectively than bristles.” A ring of cleaning elements (“bristle tufts”) are placed about the periphery of the toothbrush head which co-act with the prophy cups to clean the user's teeth and gums.

More recently, the strategic arrangement and combination of cleaning elements in the form of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts has become more common as a way of improving cleaning efficiency and maintaining the dentifrice in place during brushing. One example of the combined use and strategic arrangement of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts is a toothbrush having a head portion comprising a plurality of inner loops formed by elastomeric walls. The central inner loop is surrounded by outer loops formed of bristles. A central cleaning element, formed as a bristle tuft, is located within the elastomeric inner loop.

Another example of the combined use and strategic arrangement of elastomeric prophy cups and bristle tufts can be found in a toothbrush having a head portion comprising a plurality of soft elastomer prophy cups surrounded by bristle rings. In another embodiment, a toothbrush exists wherein the centralized prophy cups are formed by groups of densely packed cleaning elements that are surrounded by bristle rings. The bristle rings in this toothbrush are also disclosed as having one or more tufts at an inclination.

"BACKGROUND

The use of dental floss and other interdental cleaners are an important part of dental hygiene, and are used to remove plaque and other particulate from between the teeth and under the gum line, e.g., areas in the mouth where a toothbrush cannot reach. Frequently, these are the initiation sites of tooth decay, especially if not cleaned regularly. However, even with routine maintenance, caries and gingivitis still develop in these areas. Thus, there is a continuing need to develop more effective dental flosses.

Dental flosses are generally linear strips of a material having a fixed diameter/dimensions. However, teeth are not all equally spaced apart. Thus, use of a dental floss that has a diameter less than the distance between the teeth results in inefficient or ineffective cleaning between the teeth. In addition, a space usually resides between the gum and two adjacent teeth that is usually larger than the diameter of dental floss, and efficient cleaning of such area is difficult. Dental floss users occasionally use dental floss to massage the gums, but dental flosses generally are hard when pulled taut, resulting in potential damage to the gum.

Solutions to overcome such problems include manufacturing dental flosses having a wider diameter. This may pose problems insofar as it may be difficult to pass larger diameter flosses, or even normal diameter flosses, between the teeth without a substantial increase of force. The force exerted to pass the floss between the teeth is immediately released once the floss passes between the teeth, usually resulting in a painful collision with the gums, and resulting in possible lacerations and bleeding. Also this “extra” force exerted to pass the floss between the teeth would cause a fiber filaments rupture provoking shred and fray. Thus, small children may even be discouraged from flossing due to possible self-inflicted injuries.

Gelatinous elastomeric articles are known in the art, and often are used as handles for umbrellas, brushes, or for toys, dental floss, hand exercising grips, cushions, and the like. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,334,646, and 5,508,334, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, discloses a gelatinous composition comprised of an intimate blend admixture of poly(styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene) triblock copolymer with a high level of a plasticizing oil. These gelatinous polymers usually are too jelly-like and lack sufficient rigidity to be used in dental floss applications, because, inter alia, they tend to break too easily upon elongation (i.e., the tensile strength at break is too high, and the elongation at break is too low for practical use). U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,572, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses oriented gels useful in a variety of applications such as low frequency vibration applications, damping of mechanical structures, and the like.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,243, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss comprised of a fiber core, surrounded by an elastomeric outer layer. The outer layer provides a softer coating on a thicker floss used as a brush portion of a floss, but the floss itself is not stretchable due to the inner fiber core. A similar floss is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,797, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 5,918,609, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety discloses particulate modified elastomeric flosses in which particulate modification agents are either adsorbed to the surface of the floss or embedded in the surface of the floss.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,256, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss having microcapsules associated with a portion of the floss that will burst and release a color to indicate use of the floss. U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,678, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a “gel” dental floss that comprises a core material and a gel material in which the core material provides for sufficient tensile strength and the gel component provides for softness of the floss. U.S. Pat. No. 6,161,555, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss in the form of a strand or tape made from gels having improved high tear strength and improved high tensile strength.

Accordingly, there remains a need to develop dental floss compositions that solve such problems.

SUMMARY

An elastomeric dental floss comprised of at least one elastomeric material that can be enlarged and swelled without breaking in a normal flossing operation. The dental floss provides improved and gentler application to the gums, capable of massaging the gum, more interesting and fun to use, and flexible to allow easy handling during flossing.

In one embodiment, the elastomeric dental floss comprises at least an elastomeric block copolymer, polypropylene, a plasticizer, an optional flavorant, and an optional colorant. The elastomeric dental floss preferably can be elongated up to 1,500% of its initial length without breaking, a tensile strength peak at breaking point, for a 2 mm wide sample, as measured on an Instron 4464 with 2.76×103Pa (40 psig) grips, of less than 20 N·min, and an elongation at breaking point, for a 2 mm wide sample, as measured on an Instron 4464 with 2.76×105Pa (40 psig) grips, of more than 100%.

In another embodiment, the elastomeric dental floss is prepared by extrusion or injection molding a mixture of at least an elastomeric block copolymer, polypropylene homopolymer, a mineral oil, an optional flavorant, and an optional colorant through a die to produce a filament dental floss product having a cross-sectional shape selected from the group consisting of circular, star-shape, trapezoidal, elliptical, square, triangular, octagonal, and rectangular.

"BACKGROUND

The present invention relates to an oral care composition which contains an inorganic particulate component in an oral care composition, and more particularly to a dentifrice composition containing a cationic-compatible inorganic particulate component with an oral care active antibacterial compound, which achieves plaque reduction with superior breath freshening characteristics.

Halitosis, the technical term for bad breath, or Fetor ex Oris, is an undesirable condition. As a matter of fact, everyone, excluding the very young, occasionally has bad breath, with approximately 25% suffering on a regular basis and the problem tends to get worse and more frequent as one gets older. The problem seems to be evenly split between men and women. Bad breath results when proteins from the food we eat and saliva debris are broken down by bacteria. Even the cleanest mouth hosts millions of bacteria which have the potential to decompose these protein-containing particles left in the mouth. This bacterial population forms foul smelling products, called volatile sulfur compounds (VSC)—such as hydrogen sulfide (“rotten eggs”) and methyl mercaptans (“skunk smell”) and other odorous and bad tasting compounds. Up to 80-90% of bad breath that originates in the mouth is by this mechanism.

Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on teeth and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity, e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like. Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation. For example U.S. Pat. No. 5,874,068 and GB 1352420 disclose that arginine derivative compounds exhibit antibacterial activity when used in oral compositions such as mouthrinses to counter plaque formation by bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity. Arginine derivative compounds and their salts in particular show excellent inhibitory effect against microorganisms which possess relatively strong resistance to bacterial such asS. aureus, S. mutans, F. nucleatumwhich are involved in plaque formation on teeth. Other cationic oral care active ingredients, such as bis biguanides or cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPC) are also known for their inhibitory effect on plaque formation and bacterial accumulation in the oral cavity.

Although the cationic active material compounds, such as for example, the arginine derivative compounds disclosed in the prior art, are effective antibacterial agents, when these compounds are included in silica containing dentifrice it was discovered that when the dentifrice was applied to the teeth, the bioavailability of the arginine derivative compound was reduced to a level whereby little antiplaque benefit was achieved. Investigation of this problem led to the discovery that compounds such as abrasives and thickeners such as silica compounds conventionally used in the preparation of dentifrice compositions were the factor responsible for the impairment of the antiplaque efficacy of the arginine derivative compound.

Thus, there is a clear need in the art to formulate a dental product capable of delivering a cationic active antiplaque antibacterial agent whereby the ingredients used to prepare the dentifrice composition do no inhibit the bioavailability of the cationic antiplaque agent so that optimum antiplaque benefits result.

SUMMARY

In one aspect, the present invention provides a cationic-compatible inorganic component for an oral care composition comprising an inorganic particulate component comprising silica and having a surface substantially coated with a non-ionic surfactant to form the cationic-compatible inorganic component.

In another aspect the present invention provides an oral care composition comprising an active ingredient comprising a cationic compound and an inorganic particulate component having a surface substantially coated with a non-ionic surfactant.

In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of making a dentifrice having an enhanced availability of a cationic oral care active ingredient comprising coating an inorganic particulate component with a non-ionic surfactant to form a cationic-compatible inorganic component, and adding the cationic-compatible inorganic component into a dentifrice composition comprising a cationic oral care active compound.

It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over prior art oral care compositions using cationic antibacterial ingredients and inorganic particulates, such as those known in the art. Such advantages over the art include one or more of the following: enhanced bioavailability and efficacy of a cationic active ingredient translating to improved antibacterial and/or antiplaque efficacy, potential to reduce concentrations of cationic active materials in oral care compositions comprising an inorganic particulate, potential expansion of the active ingredients useful in dentifrice oral compositions. Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"FIELD

The present invention relates to a dentifrice composition and to a method of stabilizing metal ions in a dentifrice composition.

BACKGROUND

It is known to provide dentifrice compositions including a source of metal ions for delivery to the oral cavity during brushing of the teeth. Such metal ions can act as therapeutic agents. Some metal ions tend to be unstable in dentifrice compositions, particularly when the dentifrice composition includes components with which the metal ions may react during manufacture or storage of the dentifrice composition prior to use. This reduces the delivery and bioavailability of the metal ions at the oral surfaces during brushing of the teeth when using the dentifrice.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,669,929 (Boyd et al.) and the related U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2004/0126332 and 2008/0138369 disclose a dentifrice containing functional film flakes. The film flakes are formed of a water hydratable film which forms a matrix having entrained therein a constituent which may be a therapeutic material, or a cosmetic or decorative material. A number of therapeutic materials are disclosed, including fluoride salts as anticavities agents, calcium salts, anticalculus agents and other active agents including antibacterial agents, breath freshening agents, desensitizers, vitamins, herbs, whitening agents, high cleaning silica, preservatives, silicones or chlorophyll compounds. The breath freshening agents identified are zinc gluconate, zinc citrate and/or alpha ionone.

There is a need in the art to provide an improved dentifrice composition capable of enhancing the delivery and bioavailability of metal ions at the oral surfaces during brushing of the teeth when using the dentifrice.

There is a further need to enhance the delivery and bioavailability of metal ions such as zinc, stannous, and copper from a dentifrice, while maintaining stability in a low water dentifrice.

BRIEF SUMMARY

In a first aspect the present invention provides a dentifrice composition comprising an orally acceptable vehicle and at least one source of metal ions in a polymer matrix, the metal being selected from zinc, stannous, copper or combinations thereof the at least one source of metal ions comprising from 10 to 75 wt % of the total weight of the polymer matrix and the at least one source of metal ions, and wherein the dentifrice composition comprises less than 10 wt % water based on the total weight of the dentifrice composition.

In a second aspect the present invention provides a method of stabilizing at least one source of metal ions in a dentifrice composition comprising an orally acceptable vehicle, the method comprising the steps of: providing at least one source of metal ions in a polymer matrix, the metal being selected from zinc, stannous, copper or combinations thereof, the at least one source of metal ions comprising from 10 to 75 wt % of the total weight of the polymer matrix; and combining the polymer matrix with the orally acceptable vehicle to form a stabilized dentifrice composition comprising less than 10 wt % water based on the total weight of the dentifrice composition.

The orally acceptable vehicle may include at least one phosphate compound.

The present invention is predicated on the finding by the present inventors that therapeutically effective amounts of metal ions can be retained in a highly stabilized form in dentifrice compositions if the dentifrice composition has a low water content and the metal ions are in a polymer matrix which can act to protect the metal ions against premature reaction with or degradation by other components in the vehicle of the dentifrice composition.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to liquid laundry detergents provided in the form of a water-soluble pouch containing the liquid laundry detergent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Laundry detergent compositions, contained within a water-soluble pouch, are seeing wider use among consumers for reasons of convenience. Consumers are attracted to such single dose products because such products are less likely to result in spillage or dripping. Further, the unit dose laundry detergent pouches are advantageous since the consumer does not come into direct contact with the ingredients of the composition. Pouches associated with these products are typically composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) or poly(vinyl alcohol) copolymer films which can dissolve in water over a matter of seconds. The high aqueous solubility of such films necessitates a payload composition that contains a minimum amount of water. Typically, such compositions contain less than 10% water by weight.

It is generally believed that high water content liquid laundry detergents are incompatible with water-soluble films because of their water content. Thus, the attendant advantages of high water content liquid laundry detergents over other forms of laundry detergents such as granules, pastes, gels, and mulls have not been available in water-soluble unit dosage form. The advantages of liquid laundry detergents over granules, pastes, gels, and mulls include their aesthetic appearance and the faster delivery and dispersibility of the detergent ingredients to the laundry wash liquor, especially in a cool or cold water washing process.

The smaller amounts of water contained in water soluble pods have implications for both formulation and wash performance. For example, a smaller amount of water can limit the ability of certain materials to be incorporated into the composition, e.g. salts, water-soluble polymers (like anti-redeposition polymers), and water-soluble dyes. It is also well-known that removal of the chemical reactives in the payload are correlated with the extent of dissolution. As active ingredients in anhydrous formulations may not be released into the wash until full dissolution occurs, unit dose “pods” with higher water concentrations may exhibit faster action in the wash. Finally, as water is typically the least expensive component in a formulation, it is advantageous from a cost standpoint to employ the maximum amount of water, while still maintaining the desired performance.

There is a need, then, for unit dose systems with a level of water higher than that typically found in the prior art.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

It has been found that by incorporating a polymer made from vinyl dicarboxylic acid monomers into a liquid laundry detergent composition, the composition can include at least about 30 wt. % water and be useful in a liquid-containing water-soluble unit dose pouch.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement having a supplemental feature incorporated within and/or at the back of the head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristled section on a front face of the oral care implement followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums.FIG. 1schematically illustrates a conventional toothbrush10, which has a head12and a handle14. As shown, the head has bristles16extending from a front face of its head platform18. The overall thickness H1of the head, including the bristles, ranges from 15 mm to 20 mm to permit comfortable use of the toothbrush by most adults.

Some toothbrushes have a tongue cleaner on a second face that is opposite to the first face. This configuration permits the user to use a single device for cleaning their teeth, as well as their tongue, by rotating the toothbrush as needed to change the active face.FIG. 2schematically illustrates a conventional combination toothbrush/tongue cleaner device30, which is generally the same as toothbrush10except that it includes a tongue cleaner20on its rear face. The overall thickness H2of the head ranges from 16 mm to 20 mm to accommodate the tongue cleaner and to permit comfortable use of the device by most adults. As shown inFIG. 2, the head platform of conventional toothbrushes has a thickness T of 5 mm to 8 mm.

There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements that can provide multiple cleaning functions in a single device. Further, there is a need for alternative oral care implements that can simultaneously perform multiple functions and comfortably fits within a user's mouth.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This summary is not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter.

An oral care implement according to aspects of the invention can include a head platform having a plurality of faces and an insert retention space formed therebetween. The oral care implement can have an insert disposed within the insert retention space. The oral care implement can further include a transparent or translucent support member on one of the faces and a reflective insert within the insert retention space.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2010/036542, filed on May 28, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

BACKGROUND

Esterquat, a quaternary ammonium compound, is a fabric softening molecule. It is typically formed when the reaction product of long chain (C12-C22 or C16-C18) fatty acids and a tertiary amine is esterified in the presence of an acid catalyst and subsequently quaternized to obtain quaternary ammonium salts. The final product is a mixture of mono, di and tri ester components. The quaternary ammonium compound giving particular good performance and stability profiles are obtained from reaction of C12-C22 fatty acids or the hydrogenation products, usually containing some degree of unsaturation, the iodine value range of 20-90.

Saturated alkyl chains deliver greater softening efficacy compared to unsaturated ones. Cationic surfactants, when dispersed in water, form multilayer particles called vesicles that in turn deposit on fabrics. Saturated alkyl chains deliver stronger vesicle structure giving higher softening efficacy as well as fragrance delivery, compared to unsaturated alkyl chains. The increment in saturation level, however, increases the melting point and imposes handling and processing challenges because of the higher melting material. Currently, esterquat products contain 75% soft and 25% hard fatty acids or 100% hard fatty acids.

BRIEF SUMMARY

A composition comprising an esterquat that is a quaternized reaction product of an alkanol amine and a fatty acid having a ratio of fatty acid to alkanol amine of 1.5 to 1.75, wherein 45 to 75% by weight of the fatty acids are saturated.

Also, a method of softening a fabric and increasing fragrance delivery comprising treating the fabric with the composition.

Also, a use of the composition as a fabric softener.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements, such as toothbrushes which utilize special filaments.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Conventional toothbrushes have cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

Efforts have been made to improve tooth cleaning performance by developing special filaments with unique physical characteristics. One such exemplary filament has a cross-section profile that changes along the longitudinal axis of the filament. This filament has a square cross-section and is twisted so that the square cross section is rotated about the filament's central axis. When a sufficient amount of these twisted filaments are run across the teeth, they provide a unique, scrubbing mouth feel to the user. Other examples of filaments with changing profiles along the central axis are “crinkled” or “wavy” filaments, which have varying profiles like a sine wave.

Analysis of conventionally tufted toothbrushes with twisted “spiral” filaments revealed that tufts with the twisted spiral filaments have a tendency to appear “bushy” at their tips. This “bushiness” is not a desirable characteristic, since this appearance is perceived to indicate that the toothbrush is worn. However, this “bushiness” merely indicates the fact that the tips of the filaments no longer appear as discreet groups of filaments.

Improvement to the existing technology is thus desirable.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement that utilizes alternate means of attaching twisted “spiral” filaments to toothbrushes that eliminate the “bushiness” effect. Specifically, it was discovered that there is a significant amount compressive “choking” force applied to these filaments with conventional staple tufting technology. These forces are required to maintain secure tuft retention, and result in very neat and compact tufts when using conventional round filaments. However, when these compressive forces are applied to filaments with variable profiles, the filaments are easily bent along their profile inside the tuft hole. Once the filaments are free of the compressive forces outside the tuft hole, they return to their at-rest profile. As the distance between the center line of each filament is greater at rest when compressed, the filaments bend away from the center line of the tuft, resulting in the bushy appearance.

The bushy appearance may be eliminated by removing the compressive forces during attachment of the filaments to the tufts. One such means utilizes heat to melt the filament ends, and this melted mass is then trapped within the toothbrush head, providing secure filament attachment with relatively low compressive forces at the base of the tuft.

In addition, it is discovered that locating the twisted filaments along the majority of the brush head increases scrubbing action of the tooth enamel, for more cleaning effect.

In one aspect, the invention may be forming an oral care implement having a handle and a head. The method may include forming a base structure in the head. The method may also include securing a plurality of cleaning elements to the base structure, one end of each of the plurality of cleaning elements being connected to one another. At least one of the plurality of cleaning elements may be a spiral bristle.

In another aspect, the invention may be an oral care implement that includes a handle, a head connected to the handle, the head having a base structure, and a plurality of cleaning elements attached to the base structure. One end of each of the plurality of cleaning elements may be connected to one another. At least one of the plurality of cleaning elements may be a spiral bristle.

"BACKGROUND

For consumers who use liquid cleansing compositions, such as shower gels, body washes, or liquid hand soaps, foaming of the cleansing composition during use is desired. Also, it is desired to provide a sufficient amount of foam that is stable for a desired amount of time during use. Also, there is a desire for the foam to provide a creamy texture. The foam volume and creaminess usually compete against each other. As one is increased, the other one usually decreases. It is desired to provide a cleansing composition with a desired amount of foam and a desired amount of creaminess.

BRIEF SUMMARY

A cleansing composition comprising surfactants comprising decyl glucoside and coco glucoside, wherein the decyl glucoside is present in an amount by weight that is 1.5 to 2.5 times the weight of coco glucoside, and water. Having about 2 times the amount of decyl glucoside by weight as coco glucoside results in foam characteristics comparable to some cleansing compositions with anionic surfactants.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems, kits and methods, and more specifically to a system, kit and method including a toothbrush and a dispenser containing a fluid that detachably couples to the toothbrush.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for applying tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and apply the tray to his/her teeth. The tray is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to one's teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalyze the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

Further difficulties arise in that dispensers may be inadvertently activated to dispense the fluid prior to or after use due to unintentional manipulation of the actuator. This can be especially problematic if the dispenser is coupled to the oral care implement, which must be reused by the user over a period of time.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, with a fluid dispenser. Advantageously, certain embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Exemplary embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush that detachably retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care system includes fluids, either active or non-active agents, that may include without limitation, whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other fluidic materials. The dispenser can be detachably coupled to the toothbrush. In one embodiment, the dispenser may be at least partially located within the handle of the toothbrush so that a portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush. The dispenser can be completely removable from the toothbrush in certain embodiments so that the user can apply the fluid to his/her teeth with ease, and then re-couple the dispenser to the toothbrush for convenient storage. In certain embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component.

In one embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; a dispenser comprising a reservoir containing a fluid and a rotatable actuator for dispensing the fluid from the dispenser; and the dispenser alterable between: (i) a storage state in which the dispenser is detachably coupled to the toothbrush and a mechanical interference between a portion of the rotatable actuator and a portion of the toothbrush prohibits rotation of the rotatable actuator relative to the toothbrush; and (ii) an application state in which a user can rotate the rotatable actuator to dispense the fluid from the dispenser.

In another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush comprising: a handle; an anti-rotation feature; and a head; a dispenser comprising: a housing having a reservoir containing a fluid; a dispensing orifice located at a distal end of the housing; a rotatable actuator having an anti-rotation feature, the rotatable actuator located at a proximal end of the housing, wherein upon rotation of the rotatable actuator relative to the housing, the fluid from the reservoir is dispensed via the dispensing orifice; and the dispenser alterable between: (i) a storage state in which the dispenser is detachably coupled to the toothbrush and the anti-rotation features of the toothbrush and the rotatable actuator mechanically mate to prohibit rotation of the rotatable actuator relative to the toothbrush; and (ii) an application state in which a user can rotate the rotatable actuator to dispense the fluid from the dispenser.

In yet another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care system comprising: a toothbrush; a dispenser comprising a reservoir containing a fluid and a rotatable actuator for dispensing the fluid from the dispenser; the dispenser alterable between: (i) a storage state in which the dispenser is detachably coupled to the toothbrush; and (ii) an application state in which the dispenser is separated from the toothbrush; and one of the toothbrush or the dispenser comprising a key and the other of the toothbrush or the dispenser comprising a recess, and wherein the key mates with the recess when the dispenser is in the storage state so as to prohibit rotation of the rotatable actuator relative to the toothbrush.

In certain exemplary embodiments, any suitable fluid may be used with embodiments and methods described herein according to the present invention. Accordingly, the oral care treatment system may be any type of system including without limitation tooth whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection/control, and others. The invention is expressly not limited to any particular type of oral care system or oral care material, unless specifically claimed.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to novel film compositions for application to teeth to provide whitening, and other benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Most tooth whitening systems in use today contain peroxide or other bleaching material. Peroxide-based products may present formulation difficulties, due to the volatility and reactivity of hydrogen peroxide, and many countries strictly regulate peroxide levels in tooth whitening products.

There is also a need to protect the teeth from bacteria and plaque formation, and to provide sustained delivery of active agents, for example fluoride, antibacterial agents, and remineralization agents.

Polymer delivery systems for application to the teeth have in general not proved sufficiently durable to remain on the teeth for extended periods. The teeth are physically abraded by brushing and chewing and are moreover exposed to a wide range of temperatures and pH levels as a result of eating and drinking. Under ordinary conditions, therefore, most polymers will not remain on the teeth for very long. Moreover, it is desirable that the polymers themselves to not readily take up stain or otherwise discolor the teeth.

There is an unmet need in the art for a delivery system that can provide whitening particles and other active ingredients to the teeth and protect the teeth from plaque and biofilm formation for extended periods.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

We have discovered that formulations comprising acrylate/octylacrylamide copolymers are suitable for application to the teeth, that they are easily applied and that they are more durable than other polymer systems, even in the face of brushing and acid challenges, thus making them suitable vehicles for delivery and sustained application of whitening particles and/or active agents to the teeth and for protecting the teeth from staining and from biofilm and plaque formation, which could otherwise lead to tooth decay and gingivitis.

In one embodiment, the invention provides a dental film-forming composition comprisingi. an acrylate/octylacrylamide copolymer, for example 2-propenoic acid, 2-methyl-, 2-methylpropyl ester, polymer with 2-propenoic acid and N-(1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl)-2-propenamide, (e.g., DERMACRYL 79®), e.g. in an amount by weight of 5-30%, e.g. greater than 10%, for example about 20%;ii. one or more alkyl cellulose ethers, e.g., ethyl cellulose, e.g., in an amount by weight of 1-20%, e.g., about 5%;iii. an orally acceptable solvent, for example ethanol.
The formulation may be applied to provide a film which protects against staining and bacteria, and/or may optionally further comprise one or more of the following: whitening materials, for example comprising, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, hydroxylapatite, or combinations thereof; one or more antibacterial agents, e.g., triclosan; and/or one or more fluoride ion sources, e.g., sodium monofluorophosphate; calcium sources, e.g. calcium carbonate; basic ammo acids, e.g. arginine in free or salt form; or other active agents.

The invention moreover provides methods of whitening and/or protecting the teeth from stain or bacterial damage and/or delivering an active ingredient, comprising applying a formulation of the invention to the teeth.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND

Matrix metalloproteinases, which are referred to as MMPs, are a naturally occurring family of calcium- and zinc-dependent endopeptidases that are found in most mammals. Over-expression and activation of MMPs or an imbalance between MMPs and inhibitors of MMPs have been suggested as factors in the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by the breakdown of extracellular matrix or connective tissues.

The major component of periodontium (gingival, cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone) is organic matrix. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are involved in remodelling the periodontal matrix. Destructive MMPs degrade various components of the extracellular matrix both in physiological and pathological conditions. The pathologic overproduction of destructive MMPs leads to an inappropriate and excessive degradation of matrix. The overproduction of destructive MMPs facilitates bone resorption by first degrading osteoid (the nonmineralized and newly synthesized bone matrix) and then degrading the matrix, resulting in the clinical manifestations of periodontitis including gingival recession, pocket formation, loss of attachment, tooth mobility and tooth loss.

MMP-13 is one of the major destructive MMPs that plays a role in degradation of the extracellular matrix. The level of MMP-13 expression correlates to periodontitis clinical indexes. MMP-13 is detected in diseased periodontal tissue and in gingival crevicular fluid; however, MMP-13 is not detected in healthy oral mucosa. Uitto et al.American Journal of Pathophysiology,152(6), 1489 (1998).

Matrix metalloproteinase-13 was known as an enzyme responsible for bone resorption and cartilage destruction in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. Elevated levels of MMP-13 are also known to exist in gingival crevicular fluid of patients with chronic periodontitis. In addition, MMP-13 is known to contribute to both bone and connective tissue destruction in patients with periodontal diseases. Ilgenli, T. et al.Oral Diseases,12, 573 (2006).

Currently, antimicrobials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), bisphosphonates and tetracyclines used in the treatment of periodontal disease. These agents often do not provide adequate symptomatic relief and are not believed to alter the natural progression of the disease. Furthermore, powerful side effects are found with most all of these therapies. Hence, there is a great need for safe and effective therapy for these disorders.

Although there are many treatments for various aspects of periodontal disease, there remains a need to develop an improved oral composition comprising active ingredients which target destructive MMPs that facilitate bone resorption and cause tissue breakdown. In particular, there is a need to develop improved oral compositions which target MMP-13, which contributes to both bone resorption and connective tissue destruction.

SUMMARY

In a first aspect, a method for the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 comprising administering to a subject an effective therapeutic amount of a matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 inhibitor, wherein the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 inhibitor is selected from the group consisting of cranberry extract NDM, acetyl keto β-boswellic acid, resveratrol, 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl 2-hydroxyphenylcarbamate, 4-acetamidophenyl 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl carbonate, and combinations thereof.

The method provides a new mechanism for effectively inhibiting matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13 and thereby treating or preventing conditions caused by MMP-13 expression. The present inventors have surprisingly found that cranberry extract NDM, acetyl keto β-boswellic acid (AKBBA), resveratrol, 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl 2-hydroxyphenylcarbamate, 4-acetamidophenyl 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl carbonate, and combinations thereof, effectively inhibit matrix metalloproteinase MMP-13.

In a second aspect, an oral care composition, the composition comprising an orally acceptable carrier and a compound selected from the group consisting of cranberry extract non-dialyzable material, acetyl keto β-boswellic acid, resveratrol, 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl 2-hydroxyphenylcarbamate, 4-acetamidophenyl 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl carbonate, and combinations thereof, wherein the compound is present in an amount effective to inhibit MMP-13.

In a third aspect, an oral care composition comprising a compound selected from the group consisting of cranberry extract non-dialyzable material, acetyl keto β-boswellic acid, resveratrol, 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl 2-hydroxyphenylcarbamate, 4-acetamidophenyl 2-isopropyl-5-methylcyclohexyl carbonate, and combinations thereof for the treatment or prevention of a condition caused by MMP-13 expression.

Also, a method of treating degradation of the extracellular matrix, loss of attachment, tooth loss, tooth mobility, pocket formation and bone loss.

This application is related to French Patent Application Ser. No. 10 60625 filed Dec. 16, 2010 and takes priority therefrom.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a device for applying epilation wax, allowing for a precise application from the standpoint of thickness as well as dimensions of the application.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Wax dispensers which are constituted of a head mounted on a flexible container are known. The container ensures the containment of the wax and the head ensures the distribution of the wax thus stored in the container.

The wax generally used is adapted to be made more fluid by a temperature increase. This fluidity is limited so as to enable an application of the wax in a thin layer, but without running, while also ensuring a sufficient wettability vis-à-vis the hairs and/or fine hairs to be removed. When cooling, the wax imprisons the hairs. The wax is adapted not to adhere to the skin. The wax thus deposited then only has to be removed by traction to ensure the hairs imprisoned within the wax are pulled out.

To facilitate this pulling operation, it is possible to lay a small strip of mesh or non-woven material on the laid out wax, immediately after application, when the latter is still sticky and has a “tacking” power, so the small strip is also imprisoned in the cooling wax matrix, becoming affixed to this small strip. A traction on the strip facilitates grasping and makes pulling out the wax/hairs assembly including the hairs possible.

Waxes are presently of a different nature, based on synthesis polymers. More and more, these new waxes are based on natural, sugar-based polymers. The advantages of these waxes are numerous. First, these waxes use sugars which are known to originate from agricultural products and are thus renewable. In addition, these products are naturally biodegradable, and require no recycling. The cleaning is carried out with water, and therefore without necessitating any sort of solvent and without generating any waste.

However, there still remains the problem of the wax application and practicality of this operation. This wax application and removal operation must indeed be simple, fast, precise, without requiring skill, and, most importantly, with no risk to the user. Another constraint is cleaning the device since the device must be reusable after a first use in a simple and fast manner without requiring complex cleaning or disassembly.

The device according to the invention not only targets the above objections, but, also targets other industrial objectives: simplicity of fabrication to limit costs, increased affordability of the device, a limited number of pieces to facilitate its assembly and its automation on a conveyor, and durable and reliable functioning, without blockages.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods and devices for measuring the extent of deposition or uptake of agents (e.g., oral active agents) onto substrates (e.g., hydroxyapatite surfaces to mimic tooth surfaces). The amount or concentration of an agent may be efficiently determined on a substrate (e.g., with the agent and substrate both in solid form), using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Conventional methods for analyzing the deposition of agents, such as oral active agents used in dental care, involve incubating the agent with a substrate, washing the incubated substrate, and then subjecting it to solvent extraction. Subsequently, the extract is analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to provide an indirect quantification of the deposited agent. In a particular type of such an analysis, oral active agents such as Triclosan, either in neat solutions or in dentrifrice formulations, are incubated with saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disks used to model hard tissue substrates, prior to performing solvent extraction on the disk.

The solvent-extraction/HPLC method, however, has limitations. For example the method robes on the indirect analysis of an extract rather than the direct analysis of the surface onto which the agent is deposited. As a result of the extraction and subsequent HPLC steps, the analysis often takes considerable time. Moreover, the method relies on the use of an extracting agent which may not always be compatible with a given agent/substrate system (e.g., may decompose or adversely affect, for example by reaction with, the agent to be analyzed or otherwise influence the form of the agent).

Therefore, a need exists in the art for methods that can efficiently analyze or characterize the rate or amount of deposition of an agent onto a substrate. Ideally, such methods can be performed via direct analysis of the agent/substrate system and provide fast results.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to efficient, reliable methods such as screening methods for characterizing the deposition of agents (e.g., oral active agents) onto surfaces. Such methods can be used to assess and compare different formulations comprising the agent to be deposited, as well as different delivery systems for the agent. The methods are also applicable for evaluation or diagnostic purposes in patients or other users, and can therefore be applied to in vivo systems, for example, in the analysis of deposition of an oral active agent onto the tooth surface of a patient. The methods are also suitable for personal use, for example, in the case of a user desiring to monitor the effectiveness of a particular dental care regimen.

The direct methods described herein can be used to obtain an analytical result in a relatively short time, for example on the order of minutes (e.g., 5-10 minutes) or even seconds (e.g., less than 60 seconds or 10-45 seconds). The analytical methods, according to some embodiments, determine the distribution of various agents about a surface, for example, they may be used to determine whether or not they are uniformly distributed.

Accordingly, aspects of the invention relate to a method for measuring deposition of an oral agent such as an oral care active on a substrate. The method comprises contacting the substrate with the oral agent to deposit an amount of the oral agent thereon, and analyzing the substrate using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

Other aspects of the invention relate to a method of diagnosing the oral condition of a patient. The method comprises measuring the presence of an oral agent in a patient sample using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy.

Other aspects of the invention relate to a method for evaluating the effectiveness of an oral delivery system. The method comprises depositing an oral agent onto a substrate using the dental instrument, and additionally analyzing the substrate using Near-Infrared (Near-IR) spectroscopy or Ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy to measure the extent of deposition.

Other aspects of the invention relate to devices or instruments for performing any of the above methods.

Other aspects of the invention relate to one or more tangible computer readable media storing executable instructions that, when executed, cause a data processing system to perform a method comprising steps of analyzing a Near-IR spectrum or a UV spectrum generated according to the methods described above, using a mathematical method is selected from the group consisting of first and second derivative, peak area integration, partial least squares regression (PLS), Kubelka-Munk conversion, multiple linear regression, and spectral subtraction (e.g., to subtract background signals).

The methods and devices above can be used in the absolute measurement of amounts or concentrations of agents deposited onto a substrate. Alternatively, the methods may be used to obtain relative amounts or concentrations of these agents (e.g., in the case a monitoring application). The methods may be used to compare the extent of deposition of an agent as a function of its concentration in an initial composition (e.g., in a dentrifrice used to incubate to substrate according to methods described herein), as a function of the use of differing delivery systems (e.g., a paste versus a gel system), or as a function of any of a number of other parameters that will be appreciated by those having skill in the art, having regard for the present disclosure.

These and other aspects of the invention will become apparent from the following Detailed Description.

"BACKGROUND

For cleaning compositions such as hand dishwashing liquids, a correct consistency or viscosity is very important to consumers' perception of the products. The desired viscosity, expected by the consumer, should not be too thick or too thin. The consumer desires a liquid viscosity providing liquid pourability and ease of dissolution in water. To be consumer acceptable, liquid cleaning products like hand dishwashing liquids must be able to provide good cleaning and manifest the foaming and rinsing properties which consumers today expect from a commercial liquid detergent. Finally, the dissolution rate of the liquid in water is desired to be rapid so that foam generation is not delayed. Foam is a signal to consumers that the detergent is high quality. Pourability and dissolution are in part linked to liquid viscosity.

In addition, there is a general desire for cleaning formulations that are environmentally sustainable and so have reduced impact to the environment but exhibit satisfactory performance and aesthetics, at least comparable to previous less sustainable compositions.

Some liquid consumer products are sold in a concentrated form and the consumer dilutes the concentration at home. This enables products to be sold in a smaller package to reduced packaging waste, with corresponding reduced transportation costs.

There is a need for cleaning compositions, in particular hand dishwashing liquids, which can be sold in concentrated form and are readily dilutable at home by the consumer to achieve the desired viscosity properties, which properties not only present in the initial concentrated composition but also are achieved over a wide dilution range.

BRIEF SUMMARY

An aqueous liquid cleaning composition comprisinga. a plurality of surfactants, the surfactants including surfactant active components comprising from greater than 30% to up to 55% by weight, based on the weight of the composition, wherein the plurality of surfactants includesi. at least one anionic surfactant, the total anionic surfactant active component comprising from greater than 20% to up to 40% by weight, based on the weight of the composition; andii. at least one additional surfactant selected from at least one amphoteric surfactant and at least one nonionic surfactant, wherein when at least one amphoteric surfactant is present, the total amphoteric active component comprises from greater than 5% to up to 15% by weight, based on the weight of the composition; and when at least one nonionic surfactant is present, the total nonionic active component comprises from greater than 5% to up to 15% by weight, based on the weight of the composition;b. at least one divalent metal salt in an amount of 1.5% to 5% by weight, based on the weight of the composition; andc. water;
wherein the composition has a viscosity of 100 to 500 mPas as measured at 25° C., and the composition is dilutable with water to form a non-gelling diluted composition having up to six times the volume of the undiluted composition and a viscosity within the range of 100 to 1600 mPas as measured at 25° C. at any dilution up to the six times dilution.

Also, a package containing the composition, wherein the package has instructions associated therewith instructing a user to dilute the composition with water to a particular amount, the amount being selected from a dilution value and a dilution range.

Also, a method of preparing a diluted aqueous liquid cleaning composition, the method comprising the step of diluting, with water, a concentrated aqueous liquid cleaning composition to form a diluted composition that is non-gelling composition having up to six times the volume of the concentrated composition and a viscosity within the range of 100 to 1600 mPas as measured at 25° C. at any dilution up to the six times dilution.

The preferred embodiments provide liquid cleaning compositions, especially dishwashing liquids, which are formulated to permit easy viscosity control by the consumer upon dilution with water. The cleaning liquid may be sold in concentrated faun and, upon dilution by the consumer, can display stable viscosities within a desired range over a wide range of activity levels, the activity levels reducing with increased dilution.

The preferred embodiments particularly provide a viscosity property in a liquid cleaning compositions, which is a dilutable concentrated cleaning liquid, so that the liquid can be easily diluted with water by several folds and still retain a viscosity that is acceptable to consumers. A relatively constant viscosity is maintained, from the undiluted composition through to the desired diluted composition, irrespective of the dilution level across a broad dilution range, typically up to six times dilution with water. The concentrated composition can easily be diluted by the consumer at home by combining with water and inverting or gentle shaking of the package, which reliably forms a homogeneous single phase diluted composition. No gel phase (typically having a viscosity greater than 10,000 mPas) is formed during the dilution process, and the viscosity remains substantially constant, as discussed hereinafter.

Typical challenges in formulating highly concentrated surfactant-containing cleaning compositions include: reduced free water in the composition as a result of increased active ingredient content, which can render homogeneous dilution difficult; the formation of gel phases throughout the dilution process; increased processing time; longer deaeration times (i.e. for air bubble removal) upon dilution of the composition, which results from higher viscosity causing longer deaeration times; and maintaining a viscosity profile both before and after dilution that provide a similar cleaning performance at dilution as compared to conventional non-reconstitutable cleaning compositions.

These challenges are at least partly overcome by providing a substantially flat viscosity profile on dilution with the avoidance of gel phases. Mixing is facilitated, reducing processing and deaeration times. The composition remains visually clear. A desired viscosity range is not critically dependent upon the dilution level. Consumer perceived performance is made more uniform.

The preferred cleaning compositions can offer opportunities for producing more sustainable or more eco-friendly cleaning products that can be sold in a smaller package to reduced packaging waste, and then to be diluted by consumers to a regular dishwashing liquid at home in a reusable container. Alternatively, the composition may be used in super-concentrated form, in which case the composition readily dilutes in water. Such a concentrated composition saves packaging cost and reduces packaging waste and recycling.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral inflammations, such as gingivitis and periodontitis, are common oral conditions. Gingivitis, which is an inflammation of the gums, is the initial stage of gum disease. The direct cause of gingivitis is plaque, which is a soft, sticky, colorless film including bacteria that forms on the teeth and gums. Plaque, if left untreated, produces toxins that can inflame or infect the gum tissue to cause gingivitis. Untreated gingivitis can eventually spread from the gums to the ligaments and bone that support the teeth, thus causing periodontitis. While a variety of different treatments exist for preventing and suppressing oral inflammatory conditions, such treatments are subject to improvement.

Antioxidants are compounds that help inhibit oxidation reactions caused by active or free radical oxygen. Active oxygen naturally occurs in the body as a result of chemical reactions during normal cellular processes. Active oxygen can also be formed in response to excess pollution, too much UV sunlight, and exposure to cigarette smoke. In an attempt to stabilize, active oxygen molecules bond with other molecules of the body to oxidize them, which leads to, for example, destruction of cell membranes, damage to DNA, and oxidation of lipids (fats). Oxidation can ultimately lead to cancer, heart disease, stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, cataracts, and Alzheimer's disease.

Antioxidants can inhibit oxidation reactions in a number of different ways. For example, antioxidants can scavenge reactive oxygen free radical species and/or decrease localized oxygen concentration thereby reducing molecular oxygen's oxidation potential. Various antioxidants exist and antioxidants can be derived from a variety of different sources. Exemplary antioxidants include Vitamin E, Vitamin C, carotenoids, and polyphenols, such as flavonoids.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In an embodiment of the present invention, an oral composition for at least one or treating and inhibiting an oral inflammatory condition is provided. The oral composition comprises: aCamelliaextract including at least about 30% epigallocatechin gallate, at least about 50% total catechins, and at least about 60% total polyphenols; and a substantially water insoluble non-cationic anti-bacterial agent.

In another embodiment of the present invention, a method of at least one of treating and inhibiting an oral inflammatory condition is provided. The method comprises administering to an oral cavity of a subject in need thereof an effective amount of an oral composition comprising aCamelliaextract including at least about 30% epigallocatechin gallate, at least about 50% total catechins, and at least about 60% total polyphenols.

In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a method of at least one of treating and inhibiting an oral inflammatory condition and providing antioxidant activity in an oral cavity is provided. The method includes administering to an oral cavity of a human or other animal subject in need thereof an effective amount of an oral composition comprising: aCamelliaextract including at least about 30% epigallocatechin gallate, at least about 50% total catechins, and at least about 60% total polyphenols; and a halogenated diphenyl ether anti-bacterial agent.

In various embodiments, the compositions and methods of the present invention further comprise an anti-bacterial agent, such as triclosan. In various embodiments, the compositions and methods further comprise a rosemary extract.

It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compositions and methods among those known in the art. Such advantages include the use of an oral composition including a natural green tea extract to provide enhanced anti-inflammatory activity and enhanced anti-oxidant activity. Further uses, benefits, and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a class of compounds, and especially a group of fragrance precursor compounds which are used for creating a fragrance effect, preferably on surfaces such as fibers, skin, hair and hard surfaces. More specifically, the invention relates to a group of fragrance precursor compounds that break down on the above outlined surfaces, and as a result of this release perfume. In preferred embodiments the invention relates to certain hemiacetal and acetal compounds. Since the perfume or fragrance is only released when the compounds of the invention are broken down, the compounds of the invention are capable of providing a long-lasting fragrance effect. That is, the compounds of the present invention provide for a sustained release of fragrances.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing these precursor compounds. Fragrance precursor compounds consist of fragrance raw materials and functional compounds such as surfactants, polymers etc., which provide benefits such as surface protection, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning.

In addition, the present invention relates to compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, and to fragrance raw material delivery systems which provide extended fragrance benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In WO-00/72816, fragrance delivery systems are described which comprise pro-fragrances or pro-accords selected from at least two of the following: (i) aldehyde and ketone releasing pro-fragrances, which pro-fragrances comprise inter alia and preferably axazolidines: (ii) β-amino pro-fragrances; and (iii) orthoester pro-accords. The pro-fragrances described are capable of delivering fragrance raw material aldehydes and ketones to especially the human skin. More in detail, said international patent application is based on the finding that certain aldehyde fragrance raw materials, such as para-t-bucinal, cymal and lillial can be controllably released from particular heterocyclic pro-fragrances to especially the skin.

In laundry products, such as fabric softeners or detergents, generally perfume additives are present which make the said products more aesthetically pleasing to the consumers. The product should not only smell pleasantly and in that way add to the purchase perception, but also impart a pleasant and preferably long, lasting fragrance to the fibers or fabrics treated therewith. One of the problems the person skilled in the art is confronted with is that the amount of perfume carryover is rather marginal; much fragrance is lost during washing and disappears down the drain. It would be very desirable to find ways of more effectively delivering perfume or fragrances to fibers, fabrics and textiles and to achieve the fragrance effect for a longer period of time.

Colgate-Palmolive application WO 02/057400 describes a water soluble cross-linked cationic polymer derived from the polymerisation of from 5 to 100 mole percent of a cationic vinyl addition monomer, from 0 to 95 mole percent of acrylamide, and from 70 to 300 ppm of a difunctional vinyl addition monomer cross-linking agent which enhances fragrance delivery from a fabric softening composition to the fabric to be softened.

In copending Colgate-Palmolive U.S. application Ser. No. 09/893,117, filed Jun. 27, 2001, there is described a fabric care composition comprising a cationic softening compound; a non-confined fragrance oil; and at least one fabric or skin beneficiating ingredient such as a fragrance oil, contained within pressure sensitive microcapsules to provide enhanced delivery of such beneficiating ingredient to the fabric.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION

The first objective of the present invention is to provide alternative fragrances precursors or pro-fragrances.

It is another objective to provide a more efficient delivery system of fragrance or perfume to surfaces.

It is a further objective to provide functional fragrance precursor compounds that impart long lasting fragrance benefits, especially to fiber containing materials, such as fabrics and laundry.

Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a controlled or sustained release system releasing fragrance for a longer period of time.

Yet a further objective is to provide consumer product compositions which are capable to provide sustained release of fragrance.

Other objectives will become apparent from reading the following description and are especially obtained for laundry products, personal care products, bard surface care products, oral products and so on.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque or plaque bio-film is a soft deposit that forms on surfaces of the oral cavity, such as tissue and teeth, and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity (e.g., on rough calculus surfaces, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like). Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

Bacteria are present on the tongue. The bacteria are a part of a protective bio-film that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.

In spite of the extensive prior art relating to antibacterial dentifrice and oral treatment compositions, there is still a need in the art to formulate a product capable of enhanced effect in the retardation of bacterial plaque accumulation.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention encompasses an oral treatment composition containing an anti-adhesion agent, preferably a cysteine protease and most preferably ficin. In another aspect, the cysteine protease is in combination with one or more ingredients, such as antibacterial agent and surfactant. The anti-adhesion agent mitigates interaction between a subject oral cavity and plaque-forming materials.

In a further feature, a compound relatively incompatible with the anti-adhesion agent and/or the antibacterial agent is included in a limited amount and is controlled to minimize decline or degradation of activity of the anti-adhesion agent and/or the antibacterial agent. In a still further feature, a relatively incompatible compound is included and segregation is implemented to prevent or inhibit contact with the anti-adhesion agent and/or antibacterial agent.

"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a class of compounds, and especially a group of fragrance precursor compounds which are used for creating a fragrance effect, preferably on surfaces such as fibers, skin, hair and hard surfaces. More specifically, the invention relates to a group of fragrance precursor compounds that break down on the above outlined surfaces, and as a result of this release perfume. In preferred embodiments the invention relates to certain hemiacetal and acetal compounds. Since the perfume or fragrance is only released when the compounds of the invention are broken down, the compounds of the invention are capable of providing a long-lasting fragrance effect. That is, the compounds of the present invention provide for a sustained release of fragrances.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing these precursor compounds. Fragrance precursor compounds consist of fragrance raw materials and functional compounds such as surfactants, polymers etc., which provide benefits such as surface protection, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning.

In addition, the present invention relates to compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, and to fragrance raw material delivery systems which provide extended fragrance benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In WO-00/72816, fragrance delivery systems are described which comprise pro-fragrances or pro-accords selected from at least two of the following: (i) aldehyde and ketone releasing pro-fragrances, which pro-fragrances comprise inter alia and preferably oxazolidines; (ii) β-amino pro-fragrances; and (iii) orthoester pro-accords. The pro-fragrances described are capable of delivering fragrance raw material aldehydes and ketones to especially the human skin. More in detail, said international patent application is based on the finding that certain aldehyde fragrance raw materials, such as para-t-bucinal, cymal and lillial can be controllably released from particular heterocyclic pro-fragrances to especially the skin.

In laundry products, such as fabric softeners or detergents, generally perfume additives are present which make the said products more aesthetically pleasing to the consumers. The product should not only smell pleasantly and in that way add to the purchase perception, but also impart a pleasant and preferably long lasting fragrance to the fibers or fabrics treated therewith. One of the problems the person skilled in the art is confronted with is that the amount of perfume carryover is rather marginal; much fragrance is lost during washing and disappears down the drain. It would be very desirable to find ways of more effectively delivering perfume or fragrances to fibers, fabrics and textiles and to achieve the fragrance effect for a longer period of time.

Colgate-Palmolive application WO 02/057400 describes a water soluble cross-linked cationic polymer derived from the polymerisation of from 5 to 100 mole percent of a cationic vinyl addition monomer, from 0 to 95 mole percent of acrylamide, and from 70 to 300 ppm of a difunctional vinyl addition monomer cross-linking agent which enhances fragrance delivery from a fabric softening composition to the fabric to be softened.

In copending Colgate-Palmolive U.S. application Ser. No. 09/893,117, filed Jun. 27, 2001, there is described a fabric care composition comprising a cationic softening compound; a non-confined fragrance oil; and at least one fabric or skin beneficiating ingredient such as a fragrance oil, contained within pressure sensitive microcapsules to provide enhanced delivery of such beneficiating ingredient to the fabric.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION

The first objective of the present invention is to provide alternative fragrances precursors or pro-fragrances.

It is another objective to provide a more efficient delivery system of fragrance or perfume to surfaces.

It is a further objective to provide functional fragrance precursor compounds that impart long lasting fragrance benefits, especially to fiber containing materials, such as fabrics and laundry.

Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a controlled or sustained release system releasing fragrance for a longer period of time.

Yet a further objective is to provide consumer product compositions which are capable to provide sustained release of fragrance.

Other objectives will become apparent from reading the following description and are especially obtained for laundry products, personal care products, hard surface care products, oral products and so on.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

It is well known to provide a variety of different roll-ball dispensers for consumer compositions such as antiperspirant compositions, deodorant compositions and/or detergent compositions. A bottle contains the liquid composition and a roll-ball is held captive at a head at the top of the bottle, the roll-ball being covered by a removable cap when the product is not in use. It is possible to invert the bottle prior to use in order to apply the liquid composition to an inwardly directed surface of the ball prior to rotating the ball against the skin to deposit the liquid composition on a desired area of the skin. Such packages are generally intended to have an aesthetic appeal as well as provide an ergonomic design for ease of application of the consumer composition to the either the body of the user or another surface.

It is known to provide a number of different package designs which purport to meet these design criteria of aesthetic appeal combined with an ergonomic design. For example, it is known to provide a linear or angled relationship between the body of the bottle and the head of the bottle to provide convenient application to particular parts of the body, for example the underarm area, and concave or convex surfaces of the bottle for ease of manual handling, in particular secure gripping. US-A-2002/012565 discloses such an angled head.

Nevertheless, there is a need in the art for a package for a consumer composition which provides improved manual control by the user and easier application to only desired areas.

There is also a need in the art for a package for a consumer composition which is easier to use, in particular to provide an initial wetting of the ball by the liquid composition.

There is furthermore a need in the art for a package for a consumer composition which exhibits improved aesthetic appeal.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries is a major dental disease that affects the majority of the population. In the early part of the 20thcentury, investigators discovered that fluoride was effective in reducing the incidence of caries. Since that time, fluoride research has developed, and it is now well accepted that fluoride treatments benefit dental health.

Fluoride has several principal anti-cariogenic mechanisms. For example, in early dental caries, the acids formed by bacteria cause demineralization of the enamel (breakdown of the tooth structure with a loss of mineral content). Fluoride can enhance remineralization and inhibit demineralization during the earliest stages of the carious process. Fluoride from fluoridated water or fluoride toothpaste is, in part, taken up by plaque, and the majority of the fluoride provided in this manner is stored therein in bound form rather than ionic form. Subsequently, if the pH of the oral environment is lowered, bound fluoride is then released. This released fluoride then acts with calcium and phosphate ions to help reverse the effects of early demineralization.

Fluoride also acts antibacterially, in that fluoride in plaque can inhibit glycolysis (where fermentable carbohydrates are metabolized by cariogenic bacteria to produce acid). Finally, fluoride from fluoridated water or fluoride supplements, when incorporated into the developing dental enamel, can strengthen it and make it more decay-resistant. Thus, fluoride's benefits are particularly beneficial for the developing teeth of children.

Professionally administered fluorides include gel-tray applications, solutions, foams and pastes. However, over-the-counter fluoride sources such as mouthrinses, toothpastes and gels are more commonly used by consumers.

Dentifrices that are widely available typically contain fluoride ions in the range of 1,000 to 1,500 ppm. However, for some segments of the population, higher amounts of fluoride may be even more beneficial. Some patients often suffer from either more aggressive caries, or are otherwise at a higher risk of dental decay than the general population. Those patients may benefit from special dentifrices for treating high levels of caries that incorporate high levels of fluoride ions. For example, some such dentifrices incorporate sodium fluoride as a fluoride ion source, in amounts of over 1,500 ppm, 2,000 ppm or 5,000 ppm. Such compositions are highly effective in anticaries treatment.

However, a potential complication encountered with many dental applications is that of tooth sensitivity among consumers, for various health-related reasons. Treatments for sensitive teeth can vary. For example, potassium nitrate is a well-known tooth sensitivity agent used in commercial dentifrices. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 3,863,006 to Hodosh. Other sensitive teeth treatments include potassium bicarbonate or potassium chloride (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,631,185 and 4,751,072). U.S. Pat. No. 4,990,327 lists use of strontium and fluoride ions for a sensitive teeth treatment. All patents mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.

It would be desirable to treat sensitivity in teeth as well as caries and provide high levels of fluoride treatment, all using a single formulation. However, while teeth sensitivity agents as noted above can be effective if they are added in requisite effective treatment amounts, it is difficult to maintain the effective properties of the fluoride in an oral care composition that also includes such a sensitivity agent. This is because the fluoride (F−) ions tend to precipitate out when effective amounts of potassium nitrate are added. This is due to the inherently low solubility of fluoride ion sources such as sodium fluoride (usually less than 5%). On the other hand, if more solvent is added, the composition changes and tends to lose the desirable physical characteristics associated with an acceptable over-the-counter or prescription dentifrice having both such components.

Thus, there is a need in the art for a high-fluoride content oral care composition that is also capable of treating sensitive teeth, that is available in a single, easy-to use oral care composition, such as a dentifrice and more particularly a toothpaste, and that allows for the successful dissolution of both the high levels of fluoride required and the sensitivity agent. This would be beneficial for those patients who need high levels of fluoride and also suffer from sensitive teeth. It is further desirable to develop such a composition in which the anticaries activity of the fluoride ion is maintained successfully over time.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to an oral care composition comprising:

a sufficient amount of a fluoride ion source to provide at least about 2,500 ppm of fluoride ions;

an effective amount of a desensitizing agent; and

at least about 40 percent by weight water.

In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to an oral care composition comprising:

at least about 2,500 ppm of fluoride ions;

about 5 percent to about 10 percent by weight of a potassium salt;

about 40 percent to about 75 percent by weight water; and

about 0.5 percent to about 15 percent by weight of a hydrocolloid selected from the group consisting of xanthan gum and carrageenan gum.

The invention is directed, in another embodiment, to a method of maintaining anticaries activity of fluoride ion in an oral care composition comprising:

providing an oral care composition comprising at least about 2,500 ppm of fluoride ions, an effective amount of a desensitizing agent and at least about 40 percent by weight water; and

providing to the oral care composition about 0.5 percent to about 15 percent by weight of a hydrocolloid.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque is a soft deposit which forms on the surfaces of teeth. Plaque is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and bacterial by-products. Dental plaque is generally believed to be formed as a byproduct of bacterial growth and comprises a dense microbial layer consisting of a mass of microorganisms embedded in a polysaccharide matrix. Plaque tenaciously adheres to the surfaces of teeth, especially along irregular and rough surfaces, and is typically found at the gingival margin, in cracks in the enamel, and on the surface of built-up dental calculus.

Gingivitis is the inflammation or infection of the gums and the alveolar bones that support the teeth. Gingivitis is generally believed to be caused by bacteria in the mouth (particularly the bacteria instigated in plaque formation) and the toxins formed as by products from the bacteria. Periodontitis is generally believed to occur where unremoved plaque hardens into calculus (tartar) which effects the periodontal ligaments. Periodontitis is a progressively worsened state of disease as compared to gingivitis. As plaque and calculus continue to build up, the gums begin to recede from the teeth and pockets form there between, which ultimately may result in destruction of the bone and periodontal ligament. These reactions lead to the destruction of the supporting structure, continued infection, and potentially the subsequent loss of teeth.

A wide variety of antibacterial agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections associated with plaque formation. It is difficult to predict the antiplaque efficacy of antibacterial compounds when incorporated into an oral care composition with other active ingredients. Further, many antibacterial agents negatively interact with one or more components in the oral care delivery vehicle. Notwithstanding the efficacy of certain antibacterial agents, there is a continuing interest in the oral care field for oral care compositions which improve the treatment of both plaque and tartar formation, as well as to reduce the inflammation associated with gingivitis and periodontitis. It would be advantageous to have an active agent that is efficacious to combat plaque and diseases of the oral cavity, and further has anti-inflammatory effects in the oral cavity. Additionally, oral compositions that contain natural or botanically-based active ingredients are desirable.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention provides an oral care composition that containing and ingredients that comprises a compound from an extract ofmagnoliaand a compound from an extract of hops. Also provided is a method of preventing the formation of plaque on an oral surface in a mammalian subject comprising: (a) contacting the oral care to an oral surface; and (b) repeating (a) over a period of plurality of days.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to choline salts in cleaning compositions.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Tough food soil removal through quicker, more effortless means is a continuing goal in dishwashing. Most attention historically has been given to pure grease soils. Also, everyday cleaning needs are readily met by conventional cleaners and cleaning equipment. Removal of heavily encrusted and burnt on soils, however, remains a challenge. Common approaches include prolonged soaking and/or heavy scouring. Specialty solutions such as pre-treatment products can be generally effective but very abrasive or harsh (high pH) on hands and surfaces. Also, they are inconvenient to the consumer since multiple products are required for complete cleaning. An increasing problem comes from the greater use of microwave ovens that provide more intensive cooking.

It would be desirable to have a cleaner that is effective on tough soil removal.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Provided is a cleaning composition comprising at least 7.5% by weight choline chloride and at least one of a surfactant and a solvent. Provided is a cleaning composition comprising choline bicarbonate, surfactant, and solvent. Provided is a cleaning composition comprising at least 0.5% by weight of at least one choline salt chosen from choline salicylate and choline dihydrogencitrate, and at least one of a surfactant and a solvent.

Also, a method of cleaning comprising applying the cleaning composition to a substrate, and optionally removing the cleaning composition.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a class of compounds, and especially a group of fragrance precursor compounds which are used for creating a fragrance effect, preferably on surfaces such as fibers, skin, hair and hard surfaces. More specifically, the invention relates to a group of fragrance precursor compounds that break down on the above outlined surfaces, and as a result of this release perfume. In preferred embodiments the invention relates to certain hemiacetal and acetal compounds. Since the perfume or fragrance is only released when the compounds of the invention are broken down, the compounds of the invention are capable of providing a long-lasting fragrance effect. That is, the compounds of the present invention provide for a sustained release of fragrances.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing these precursor compounds. Fragrance precursor compounds consist of fragrance raw materials and functional compounds such as surfactants, polymers etc., which provide benefits such as surface protection, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning.

In addition, the present invention relates to compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, and to fragrance raw material delivery systems which provide extended fragrance benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In WO-00/72816, fragrance delivery systems are described which comprise pro-fragrances or pro-accords selected from at least two of the following: (i) aldehyde and ketone releasing pro-fragrances, which pro-fragrances comprise inter alia and preferably oxazolidines; (ii) β-amino pro-fragrances; and (iii) orthoester pro-accords. The pro-fragrances described are capable of delivering fragrance raw material aldehydes and ketones to especially the human skin. More in detail, said international patent application is based on the finding that certain aldehyde fragrance raw materials, such as para-t-bucinal, cymal and lillial can be controllably released from particular heterocyclic pro-fragrances to especially the skin.

In laundry products, such as fabric softeners or detergents, generally perfume additives are present which make the said products more aesthetically pleasing to the consumers. The product should not only smell pleasantly and in that way add to the purchase perception, but also impart a pleasant and preferably long, lasting fragrance to the fibers or fabrics treated therewith. One of the problems the person skilled in the art is confronted with is that the amount of perfume carryover is rather marginal; much fragrance is lost during washing and disappears down the drain. It would be very desirable to find ways of more effectively delivering perfume or fragrances to fibers, fabrics and textiles and to achieve the fragrance effect for a longer period of time.

Colgate-Palmolive application WO 02/057400 describes a water soluble cross-linked cationic polymer derived from the polymerisation of from 5 to 100 mole percent of a cationic vinyl addition monomer, from 0 to 95 mole percent of acrylamide, and from 70 to 300 ppm of a difunctional vinyl addition monomer cross-linking agent which enhances fragrance delivery from a fabric softening composition to the fabric to be softened.

In copending Colgate-Palmolive U.S. application Ser. No. 09/893,117, filed Jun. 27, 2001, there is described a fabric care composition comprising a cationic softening compound; a non-confined fragrance oil; and at least one fabric or skin beneficiating ingredient such as a fragrance oil, contained within pressure sensitive microcapsules to provide enhanced delivery of such beneficiating ingredient to the fabric.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION

The first objective of the present invention is to provide alternative fragrances precursors or pro-fragrances.

It is another objective to provide a more efficient delivery system of fragrance or perfume to surfaces.

It is a further objective to provide functional fragrance precursor compounds that impart long lasting fragrance benefits, especially to fiber containing materials, such as fabrics and laundry.

Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a controlled or sustained release system releasing fragrance for a longer period of time.

Yet a further objective is to provide consumer product compositions which are capable to provide sustained release of fragrance.

Other objectives will become apparent from reading the following description and are especially obtained for laundry products, personal care products, hard surface care products, oral products and so on.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"TECHNICAL FIELD

The present invention relates to a class of compounds, and especially a group of fragrance precursor compounds which are used for creating a fragrance effect, preferably on surfaces such as fibers, skin, hair and hard surfaces. More specifically, the invention relates to a group of fragrance precursor compounds that break down on the above outlined surfaces, and as a result of this release perfume. In preferred embodiments the invention relates to certain hemiacetal and acetal compounds. Since the perfume or fragrance is only released when the compounds of the invention are broken down, the compounds of the invention are capable of providing a long-lasting fragrance effect. That is, the compounds of the present invention provide for a sustained release of fragrances.

In a further aspect, the present invention relates to a process for preparing these precursor compounds. Fragrance precursor compounds consist of fragrance raw materials and functional compounds such as surfactants, polymers etc., which provide benefits such as surface protection, surface conditioning, and/or surface cleaning.

In addition, the present invention relates to compositions comprising the compounds of the invention, and to fragrance raw material delivery systems which provide extended fragrance benefits.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In WO-00/72816, fragrance delivery systems are described which comprise pro-fragrances or pro-accords selected from at least two of the following: (i) aldehyde and ketone releasing pro-fragrances, which pro-fragrances comprise inter alia and preferably oxazolidines; (ii) β-amino pro-fragrances; and (iii) orthoester pro-accords. The pro-fragrances described are capable of delivering fragrance raw material aldehydes and ketones to especially the human skin. More in detail, said international patent application is based on the finding that certain aldehyde fragrance raw materials, such as para-t-bucinal, cymal and lillial can be controllably released from particular heterocyclic pro-fragrances to especially the skin.

In laundry products, such as fabric softeners or detergents, generally perfume additives are present which make the said products more aesthetically pleasing to the consumers. The product should not only smell pleasantly and in that way add to the purchase perception, but also impart a pleasant and preferably long lasting fragrance to the fibers or fabrics treated therewith. One of the problems the person skilled in the art is confronted with is that the amount of perfume carryover is rather marginal; much fragrance is lost during washing and disappears down the drain. It would be very desirable to find ways of more effectively delivering perfume or fragrances to fibers, fabrics and textiles and to achieve the fragrance effect for a longer period of time.

Colgate-Palmolive application WO 02/057400 describes a water soluble cross-linked cationic polymer derived from the polymerisation of from 5 to 100 mole percent of a cationic vinyl addition monomer, from 0 to 95 mole percent of acrylamide, and from 70 to 300 ppm of a difunctional vinyl addition monomer cross-linking agent which enhances fragrance delivery from a fabric softening composition to the fabric to be softened.

In copending Colgate-Palmolive U.S. application Ser. No. 9/893,117, filed Jun. 27, 2001, there is described a fabric care composition comprising a cationic softening compound; a non-confined fragrance oil; and at least one fabric or skin beneficiating ingredient such as a fragrance oil, contained within pressure sensitive microcapsules to provide enhanced delivery of such beneficiating ingredient to the fabric.

OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION

The first objective of the present invention is to provide alternative fragrances precursors or pro-fragrances.

It is another objective to provide a more efficient delivery system of fragrance or perfume to surfaces.

It is a further objective to provide functional fragrance precursor compounds that impart long lasting fragrance benefits, especially to fiber containing materials, such as fabrics and laundry.

Moreover, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a controlled or sustained release system releasing fragrance for a longer period of time.

Yet a further objective is to provide consumer product compositions which are capable to provide sustained release of fragrance.

Other objectives will become apparent from reading the following description and are especially obtained for laundry products, personal care products, hard surface care products, oral products and so on.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to film barrier liners for the shoulder/nozzles of tube packaging. In addition this invention relates to continuous methods for making tube shoulder/nozzles with film laminate liners to preclude the absorption of product components from a packaged substance in contact with the shoulder/nozzle.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed to tube packaging and a method of making that tube packaging so as to minimize the absorption of components of the product in the tube by the tube components. A tube package consists of the tube body, the tube shoulder/nozzle and a closure. The absorption of product components by the tube body can be minimized by the use of a tube laminate structure that includes a barrier such as a metal foil or a plastic film such as ethylene vinyl alcohol, polythylene terephthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, or acrylonitrile methyl-acrylate copolymers. The shoulder/nozzle consists of a large amount of a polymer or copolymer that has a plurality of alkene groups. Therefore, a barrier is required between the shoulder/nozzle and the product in the tube.

The barrier requirement has been recognized in the prior art for more than 30 years. U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,968 discloses the friction fit of a barrier insert into the shoulder nozzle of a tube. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,565,293 and 4,185,757 disclose the forming of a shoulder/nozzle on and around a barrier insert. In this way the shoulder/nozzle and the barrier insert are essentially a single piece. It is further disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,185,757 that at the time that the shoulder/nozzle is being formed on and around the barrier nozzle that the shoulder/nozzle can be attached to the tube body. This has many structural and manufacturing advantages. U.S. Pat. No. 5,656,346 discloses performing an insert with the insert having a polyethylene layer and a polyethylene terephthalate layer or ethylene vinyl alcohol layer. The polyethylene layer will be adjacent to the shoulder/nozzle material and will bond to the shoulder/nozzle material and the polyethylene terephthalate layer or ethylene vinyl alcohol layer will be in contact with the product to function as a barrier between the product and the shoulder/nozzle. U.S Patent Application 2005/0029216 is directed to a preformed insert that has a particular geometry. However, that geometry appears to be disclosed in the aforementioned patents.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to using flexible film laminates as the barrier in shoulder/nozzles and to a method of producing the laminate film liners and the inserting and sealing of these laminate film liners in the shoulder/nozzles. These laminate film liners are film laminates that are not preformed to the shape of the shoulder/nozzle. They conform to the shape of the shoulder/nozzle upon being inserted into the shoulder/nozzle and sealed to the shoulder/nozzle. The shape of the shoulder/nozzle can vary within certain bounds and the same laminate film liner can be used. If the shape of the shoulder nozzle is outside of the certain bounds, then all which will be needed is a different die cutter to form the nozzle opening and to cut the film laminate to the required diameter. This is an easy equipment change that can be made in minutes. There also is the advantage that less manufacturing equipment is needed when using film laminate of the present invention as opposed to preformed barrier inserts. More specifically, injection molding equipment to make preformed inserts, hoppers and sorting equipment to hold the preformed inserts, equipment to align the preformed inserts for input into a formed shoulder/nozzle, or into equipment to form the shoulder/nozzle on the preformed insert, are not required when using the laminate film liner as in the present invention. In the present invention there is only the need to store rolls of film laminate material. The net result is a savings on the capital cost of equipment and a savings in manufacturing operations. There is set out an effective way to use film laminate material as the barrier in shoulder/nozzles of tubes.

The methods for making tube shoulder/nozzles with a barrier for the tube shoulder/nozzles comprises forming the tube shoulder/nozzle, placing the tube shoulder/nozzle in a holder with the shoulder end exposed, placing a film laminate comprising a barrier layer and a polymer layer above the shoulder end, the polymer layer facing into the shoulder/nozzle, contacting the film laminate with a die/mandrel to (i) cut the film laminate to fit into the shoulder/nozzle, and (ii) insert the film laminate into the shoulder/nozzle. The cutting of the film laminate to fit into the shoulder/nozzle comprises two operations, one is to form a nozzle opening in the film laminate and the other is to cut the film laminate to a diameter that can fit the shoulder of the shoulder/nozzle. The cut film laminate in the area of the nozzle is comprised of one of a circular aperture, a plurality of slits and a circular aperture, and a plurality of slits.

The method can comprise a plurality of stations, the die cutting of the film laminate to fit into the shoulder/nozzle being at one station and the sealing of the film laminate into the shoulder/nozzle being at another station. The die cutting of the film laminate to fit into the shoulder/nozzle comprises two operations, one is to form a nozzle opening in the film laminate and the other is to cut the film laminate to fit into the shoulder of the shoulder/nozzle. The nozzle opening of the film laminate is comprised of one of an aperture, usually a circular aperture, a plurality of slits or an aperture with a plurality of peripheral slits. The shoulder/nozzles after the film laminate is inserted into the shoulder/nozzle, and prior to sealing the film laminate in the shoulder/nozzle, are fed to a detector to determine the positioning of the film laminate in the shoulder/nozzle. If not properly positioned, it will be rejected. The film laminate is sealed to the shoulder/nozzle by heat bonding the polymer layer of the film laminate to the inner surface of the shoulder/nozzle. After the film laminate is sealed into the shoulder/nozzle, the shoulder/nozzle is fed to a detector to determine the positioning of the film laminate sealed into the shoulder/nozzle. If the film laminate is not properly positioned, the shoulder/nozzle is rejected. After the film laminate is sealed into the shoulder/nozzle, the shoulder/nozzle is fed to be attached to a tube body. The tube body with the shoulder/nozzle attached will have a closure attached, the tube filled with a product and the lower end crimped sealed to close the tube body. This tube structure is particularly useful for dentifrice products. Such products are usually sold in tubes.

In an alternate embodiment, the film laminate can be bonded to the shoulder/nozzle at the time that the film laminate is being die cut to form the nozzle aperture and to fit into the shoulder. In such an embodiment the die/mandrel is at a temperature to seal the die cut film laminate into the shoulder/nozzle after inserting the die cut film laminate into the shoulder/nozzle. The shoulder/nozzle, after the film laminate is sealed into the shoulder/nozzle, is fed to a detector to determine the positioning of the film laminate sealed into the shoulder/nozzle. If not properly positioned, it will be rejected. The shoulder/nozzles then are fed to be attached to a tube body.

The film laminate has a thickness of about 100 micron to about 400 micron, the barrier layer having a thickness of about 15 micron to about 100 micron and the polymer layer having a thickness of about 75 micron to about 250 micron. A tie layer bonding the barrier layer to the polymer layer will have a thickness of about 10 micron to about 50 micron. The barrier layer of the barrier/polymer laminate film can be any polymeric material that is essentially inert to the substances that are to be packaged in the tube. Useful barrier layers can be selected from polyethylene terephthalate, polytrimethylnaphthalate, polyethylene naphthalate, ethylene vinylalcohol copolymers, acrylonitrile-methyl acrylate copolymers, amorphous polyamides, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid polymers and polyhydroxy alkanote polymers. The polymer of the barrier/polymer film laminate can be any polymer that can be bonded to the shoulder plastic. Usually it will be essentially the same as the nozzle/shoulder10plastic. Preferably the polymer will contain a fluorescent material. After the film laminate has been inserted into shoulder of the shoulder/nozzle the film laminate is contacted with a light source to activate the fluorescence to ascertain the position of the film laminate in the shoulder.

This application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/053500, filed Aug. 12, 2009, the contents of which are incorportated herein by reference.

The present invention relates to an oral care composition and the use of such an oral care composition for treating conditions caused by biofilm formation. The present invention also relates to a method for inhibiting biofilm formation and/or degrading biofilm.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Bisabolol is a natural monocyclic sesquiterpene alcohol. It is commonly found in nature as the principle extract of chamomile. It is used in the cosmetics industry specifically for its skin healing properties, as well as its anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, and anti-bacterial benefits.

Szalontai, M; Verzár-Petri, G.; Flórián, E.; Gimpel, F., Pharmaz. Ztg, 120, 982 (1975) and Szalontai, M., Verzár-Petri, G.; Flórián, E.; Gimpel, F., Dtsch. Apoth. Ztg. 115, 912 (1975) disclose the bactericidal and fungicidal action of biologically active substances of chamomile including α-bisabolol.

Issac O., Dtsch. Apoth. Ztg 120, 567-570 (1980) discloses that bisabolol has antimicrobial and antimycotic effects.

Luppold O., Pharmazie in unserer Zeit, 13,(1984), 3, p 65-70 discloses that chamomile is an effective remedy in traditional medicine. This document discloses that bisabolol, especially (−)-α-bisabolol is important for the pharmacological action of chamomile oil and have antiphlogistic, spamolytic and antibacterial activity.

Sesquiterpenoids including bisabolol have also been found to increase bacterial permeability to antimicrobial agents. Brehm-Stecher, B. F., Johnson, E. A., Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy 47(10), (2003), p 3357-3360 and WO99/66796 each disclose that the sesquiterpenoids nerolidol, farnesol, bisabolol and apritone were found to enhance non-specifically the permeability of cultured bacterial cells to certain exogenous chemical compounds including antimicrobial agents.

A biofilm is a structured group of microorganisms encapsulated within a self-developed polymeric extracellular matrix. Biofilms are typically adhered to a living or inert surface. In the human or animal body biofilms can form on any internal or external surface. Biofilms have been found to be involved in a wide variety of microbial infections in the body and, therefore, cause a number of conditions including urinary tract infections, middle-ear infections, formation of dental plaque and gingivitis.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,116,602 discloses an antiplaque oral composition containing a low concentration of a sesquiterpene alcohol flavour compound to inhibit the formation of dental plaque in the presence of an additive selected from the group consisting of benzoic acid, a preservative, and a polycarboxylate and mixtures thereof, in an oral vehicle. The sesquiterpene alcohol flavour compound is not disclosed as an antimicrobial agent by itself, but must be used in combination with the additives disclosed therein.

JP 58213706 discloses a composition for the oral cavity capable of suppressing and inhibiting the formation of bacterial plaque, preventing dental caries and periodontosis, obtained by blending a composition for an oral cavity with an active ingredient selected from amygdalin, indigo, sanshool, bisabolol and rutin.

JP 2005298357 discloses a composition for the oral cavity containing a biosurfactant selected from a glycolipid produced by the microorganism, a polypeptide produced thereby and a derivative thereof and further contains one, two or more kinds of essential oil components selected from thymol, anethole, eugenol, bisabolol, farnesol and nerolidol.

Microorganisms present in a biofilm have significantly different properties from free-floating microorganisms of the same species. This is because the polymeric extracellular matrix acts to protect the microorganisms from the surrounding environment allows the microorganisms to cooperate and interact in various ways which are not exhibited by free-floating microorganisms. These complex communities of microorganisms present a unique challenge in that they are often resistant to classical means of antimicrobial control. Bacteria living in a biofilm exhibit increased resistance to antibiotics because the dense extracellular matrix and the outer layer of cells protect the interior of the biofilm from the effects of the antibiotics. Therefore, known antimicrobial agents will not have the same effect on bacteria present in a biofilm.

There is a need in the art to provide an improved oral composition capable of inhibiting biofilm formation and degrading biofilms.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In a first aspect the present invention provides an oral care composition comprising a sesquiterpenoid and an antimicrobial agent, wherein the sesquiterpenoid and the antimicrobial agent are present in an amount effective to inhibit and/or degrade a biofilm in the oral cavity. In another aspect, the invention provides an oral care composition comprising sesquiterpenoid and an antimicrobial agent that improves the anti-biofilm (killing properties) of the antimicrobial agent.

The composition according to the present invention provides a new means for inhibiting formation of and/or degrading a biofilm in the oral cavity. The present inventors have surprisingly found that the sesquiterpenoid enhances the antibiofilm activity of antimicrobial agents. The combination of both the sesquiterpenoid and an antimicrobial agent has been found to provide a synergistic effect on the inhibition of biofilms. In an aspect, the sesquiterpenoid is selected from the group consisting of nerolidol, farnesol, bisabolol, apritone, and mixtures thereof.

In a second aspect the present invention provides a composition as defined above for use as a medicament. The present invention also provides a composition comprising a sesquiterpenoid and an antimicrobial agent for the treatment or prevention of a condition caused by biofilm formation. The present invention also provides a method for inhibiting biofilm formation and/or degrading a biofilm in a subject comprising administering to the subject a composition comprising a sesquiterpenoid and an antimicrobial agent. The method may be used for treating or preventing a condition caused by biofilm formation.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to multi-purposed dentifrice products.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries, i.e., tooth decay, is a leading cause of tooth damage in humans. Dental caries begins with lesions of so-called “white spots”, which are demineralized areas below the surface of intact dental enamel. Such subsurface lesions are formed before a cavity is detectable. If unchecked, surface enamel above a subsurface lesion eventually collapses, leading to cavitations and subsequent loss of tooth structure.

The primary component of the enamel and dentin in teeth is calcium phosphate in the form of calcium hydroxyapatite. This material is highly insoluble at normal oral pHs. However, calcium phosphate salts are more soluble in acidic media, and they are subjected to acids produced from the glycolysis of sugars by the action of various oral bacteria. Therefore, the acids cause carious lesions that form in teeth.

Although it is desirable to prevent caries from spreading, it is also desirable to restore the carious tooth to its original state. Restoration of a carious tooth to its original state involves the process of remineralization. The object of remineralization is to deposit hydroxyapatite in the carious lesion such that the dental enamel incorporates the hydroxyapatite into its structure at the point of lesion. Thus, remineralization not only prevents further tooth decay but also restores the tooth to its original state.

Saliva is supersaturated with respect to calcium and phosphate ions. Saliva therefore helps protect teeth against demineralization and can slowly remineralize teeth that have become demineralized by acids. It is also well known that the presence of fluoride ions can enhance the natural remineralization process and this is one of the accepted mechanisms by which fluoride toothpastes and rinses protect against caries. However, the modest levels of calcium and phosphate in saliva limit the efficacy of fluoride containing toothpastes and rinses to remineralize teeth. Therefore, it is highly desirable to increase the available concentration of calcium and phosphate ions in the oral cavity to speed up the remineralization process. To do so, one must taking into account of calcium phosphate's low solubility at the pH of saliva, and that calcium ions must be prevented from reacting with the phosphate ions or fluoride ions until immediately before use, so that the ions would not precipitate prematurely before reach oral cavity.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to attempt to cure the deminineralization problem. Examples are U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,037,639; 5,268,167; 5,437,857; 5,427,768; and 5,460,803 (all to Tung), teach the use of amorphous calcium compounds such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), amorphous calcium phosphate fluoride (ACPF) and amorphous calcium carbonate phosphate (ACCP) for use in remineralizing teeth. These amorphous compounds or solutions which form the amorphous compounds when applied either onto or into dental tissue prevent and/or repair dental weaknesses such as dental caries, exposed roots and dentin sensitivity. The compounds are claimed to have high solubilities, fast formation rates and fast conversion rates (to apatite). In the Tung patents, remineralization is accomplished by bringing the amorphous compound into contact with the dental tissue. This can be done directly, i.e., putting an amorphous compound directly on the tooth, or indirectly through a carrier, i.e., incorporating the amorphous compound in a carrier such as a gel, a chewing gum, or a toothpaste and applying the carrier to the dental tissue. Once contact is established with the tooth, the amorphous calcium phosphate compounds will recrystallize to the less soluble apatite form in the lesion and reform the tooth. However, under conditions where amorphous calcium phosphate compounds are stable, the quantity of calcium and phosphate released is relatively low and, therefore, remineralization is slower than desirable.

The aforementioned patents to Tung teach the use of two-part solutions wherein a first part contains phosphate salt(s) and a second part contains calcium salts(s), wherein either the first part or the second part further contains carbonate salt(s). In addition, the Tung patents teach solutions formed by dissolving in water a solid powder containing calcium salt(s). These solutions are salt(s) and carbonate salt(s). These solutions are then applied to dental tissue. The Tung patents further teach the use of non-carbonated solid powders containing mixtures of calcium salts and phosphate salts which can be applied directly to the tooth or dispersed in gel, chewing gum, or other non-aqueous medium such as toothpaste which is placed in contact with the tooth. The patents teach that these powders are easily dissolved in saliva and then reprecipitated as an amorphous calcium phosphate compound. However, the Tung patents do not disclose the pHs of aqueous solutions formed from the non-carbonated solid powders.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,502 to Winston et al. is directed to one-part, non-aqueous products and methods of using same to remineralize subsurface lesions, wherein the products contain at least one water-soluble calcium salt; at least one water-soluble phosphate salt; either a stabilizer or a hydrophilic, non-aqueous, water-soluble vehicle; and, optionally, at least one water-soluble fluoride salt. When the components are mixed with water or saliva to form an aqueous mixed solution, the solution has a pH of from about 4.5 to about 10.0.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,159,449 to Winston et al., is directed to two-parts, simultaneously releasable dentifrice. Such dentifrice compositions are capable of providing remineralization of subsurface lesions and/or mineralization of exposed dentinal tubules.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,321 to Lee et al. discloses a two-parts dentifrice that includes one part made of water soluble calcium phosphate salt having a pH less than 7, and a second part containing an alkaline material and a fluoride ion source to achieve a pH greater than 7.5. The two parts are stored separated and simultaneously released to generate hydroxyapatite depositing on dental enamel.

Besides dental caries, another major teeth problem facing the consumers is dental plaque build-up. Dental plaque is essentially a colorless biofilm that develops naturally on the teeth by colonizing bacteria attaching itself to a smooth surface (of a tooth). Dental plaque is soft enough to come off if scraped with a fingernail. However, If not removed, the plaque starts to harden and calcified within 48 hours, and in about 10 days the plaque becomes dental calculus (tartar), rock-hard and difficult to remove.

As the mature calculus develops, it becomes visibly white or yellowish in color unless stained or discolored by some extraneous agent. In addition to being unsightly and undesirable from an aesthetic standpoint, the mature calculus deposits can be constant sources of irritation of the gingival, causing gingivitis, which if left untreated, results in periodontitis. Generally periodontitis cannot be treated by superficial use of chemotherapeutic agents, and the intervention of a dentist is required and surgery is often necessary.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to attempt to remove or prevent plaque and/or tartar. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,455,024 to Winston et al. discloses dentifrices comprised of sodium bicarbonate, zinc oxide, and an anti-caries agent to inhibit the formation of plaque

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,248,310 to Lee et al. discloses a two-parts dentifrice that includes one part made of water soluble calcium phosphate salt having a pH less than 7, and a second part containing an alkaline material and a fluoride ion source to achieve a pH greater than 7.5. The two parts are stored separated and simultaneously released to generate a system for inhibiting tartar around the teeth.

While periodontitis, gingivitis, and tooth decay have longed vexed the human population, ill appearance of teeth due to stains are equally undesirable. Indeed, many individuals desire a “bright” smile and white teeth, and consider dull and stained teeth cosmetically unattractive. Unfortunately, without preventive or remedial measures, stained teeth are almost inevitable due to the absorbent nature of dental material.

Stains on teeth can be of the extrinsic or intrinsic type. The types of attractive forces involved in extrinsic dental stains include electrostatic and van der Waal forces, hydration forces, hydrophobic interactions, dipole-dipole moment forces, and hydrogen bonds. The strength of adhesion for chromogens and pre-chromogens are not well understood. A method of classification was attempted to further describe dental stains which involves three categories (Nathoo SA. The chemistry and mechanisms of extrinsic and intrinsic discoloration.J Am Dent Assoc1997 April; 128 Suppl: 6S-10S).

In category 1 stains, the color of the discoloration is the same as the color of the material (chromogen) that causes the stain. The substances of tea, coffee and wine contain tannins and are composed of polyphenols such as catechins and leucoanthocyanins. These materials generate color due to the presence of conjugated double bonds and are thought to interact with the tooth surface via an ion exchange mechanism. Also included in the mechanism of adherence of the chromogen to the tooth is the salivary pellicle, a protein structure adhering to enamel via calcium bridges.

In category 2 stains, pigmented materials bind to the pellicle or tooth and subsequently change color. An example of this would be the cervical yellow stain turning brown with age. A proposed mechanism for this change is through the further accumulation or chemical modification of pellicle proteins (denaturation by acids or detergents). Intensification may occur via a metal bridging mechanism. Category 2 stains are considered to be more difficult to remove than category 1 stains.

In category 3 stains, the binding of a colorless material to teeth can undergo chemical reactions or transformations. The colorless material is termed a pre-chromogen. Examples of this type of staining are the induction of chlorhexidene stain, browning of foods high in carbohydrates and sugars via a rearrangement of the carbohydrates and amino acids, termed the Maillard or non-enzymatic browning reaction, and staining from stannous fluoride.

Thus, extrinsic stains result from chromogens binding either to enamel or probably more so to pellicle. The removal of a pellicle layer via a bleaching system will present a whiter tooth. The pellicle is a natural occurring biolayer and will re-establish itself if removed. It will do so with minimal chromogen build-up.

Intrinsic stains include phenomena occurring both before and after eruption of the tooth from the alveolar bone into the oral cavity. Pre-eruptive phenomena include endemic fluorosis, tetracycline staining, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and amelogenesis imperfecta. Post-eruptive phenomena include pulpal hemorrhaging, and deposition of secondary dentin or metals in a tooth from an amalgam restoration.

Everyday activities such as smoking or other oral use of tobacco products, and eating, chewing or drinking certain foods and beverages (in particular coffee, tea and red wine), cause undesirable staining of surfaces of teeth. Staining can also result from microbial activity, including that associated with dental plaque.

The chromogens or color causing substances in these materials become part of the pellicle layer and can permeate the enamel layer. Even with regular brushing and flossing, years of chromogen accumulation can impart noticeable tooth discoloration.

There are a variety of compositions described in the art for preventing or treating the discoloration of teeth. In particular, to combat staining and brighten or restore the natural enamel color, a variety of products containing bleaching materials are commercially available for professional and consumer use. The materials most commonly used in teeth whitening today are peroxides. Such peroxides include hydrogen peroxide, carbamide peroxide, sodium perborate, and sodium percarbonate.

When these peroxides are in appropriate contact with teeth they will usually oxidize the majority of stains, rendering the teeth whiter.

Current home whitening treatment methods include abrasive toothpastes, toothpastes that produce oxides, whitening gels for use with a dental tray and whitening strips.

The effectiveness of such techniques depends on a variety of factors including the type and intensity of the stain, the type of bleaching agent, contact time of the bleaching agent on the teeth, the amount of available bleaching active in the composition, the ability of the bleaching agent to penetrate the tooth enamel, and consumer compliance.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art for whitening teeth. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,891,211 to Winston discloses a hydrogen peroxide-releasing toothpaste comprising sodium bicarbonate and sodium percarbonate in a polyethylene glycol base for removing stains and odor.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 6,521,215 to Okay discloses a dentifrice composition for whitening and remineralizing teeth, wherein the three key components are a whitening agent, a protease enzyme, and a remineralizing agent.

Another example is U.S. Application Number 2007/0071696 to Wang et al. discloses a dual phase whitening oral care composition. The composition includes a first phase that contains a whitening agent in a substantially anhydrous and orally acceptable carrier and a second phase that contains an abrasive and an anti-calculus agent in an orally acceptable carrier. The first phase and the second phase are maintained separately from each other until dispensed.

Although consumers recognize the need to maintain healthy teeth, and have used various dentifrice products on the markets for this purpose, it must be noted that majority of the consumers preferred flavored dentifrices, in particular those that provide a “refreshing” taste upon usage. Refreshing flavors such as wintergreen are known to degrade in liquid (aqueous and non-aqueous) alkaline environments. For non-liquid formulation, wet granulations often supply sufficient water to initiate the degradation process even though the ultimate product (pressed tablet, mint, or candy) appears dry. Meanwhile, other components have sufficient trapped water within their crystal structure which can be released on compression and initiate the degradation. Still other components are hygroscopic to a sufficient degree such that moisture is picked up from the ambient environment in sufficient amounts to initiate the degradation process.

Furthermore, significant wintergreen degradation is observed when the bicarbonate dentifrices are flavored with wintergreen. Bicarbonate containing dentifrice formulations are often prepared with various standard humectants such as propylene glycol, glycerin, and polyethylene glycol. Where water is present, the degradation is more pronounced than when water is absent, but even in the absence of water, wintergreen degradation is still significant with these humectants.

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art to incorporate flavors in alkaline dentifrices. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 5,709,852 to Gopalkrishnan et al., disclosing a stable non-aqueous carrier for personal care product containing flavor and bicarbonates, comprising about 80-98% by weight of anon-ionic liquid triblock EO/PO/EO copolymer of MW=1000-5000, and about 2-20% by weight of a non-ionic solid triblock EO/PO/EO copolymer of MW=4000-16,000.

However, none of the above products or references disclosing whitening and/or reminerialization addresses the issue of removing plaque build-up. Moreover, none of the references disclosing remineralization or removal/prevent of plaque teaches whitening teeth. Furthermore, some of the mentioned references teach that of a two-parts dentifrice, and none address the issue of flavor degradation in alkaline dentifrice. Given the tedious task of teeth maintenance, there is a need for developing a flavored single-part and multi-purposed dentifrice, such that it requires only a single application to achieve the functions of teeth whitening, teeth remineralization, and prevention or removal of plaque.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A multi-purposed, single-part dentifrice comprising a remineralization component, a teeth whitening component, and a plaque inhibiting component.

This application is a national stage application of Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent Application No. PCT/US/US2011/54938, filed Oct. 5, 2011, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to the field of packaging, and specifically to packaged oral care implements with easy-open features to facilitate access to the oral care implements.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In the commercialization of toothbrushes, the current trend is to package toothbrushes in blister packages. While the use of blister packages has proved to be cost-effective and effective at adequately protecting the toothbrush contained therein, existing blister packages are often difficult to open. While easy-open blister packages have been introduced into the art, existing easy-open blister packages are either complex to manufacture and/or compromise the containment of the product. Still a further issue with existing easy-open blister packages is that sharp protruding edges may be exposed that can prevent shipping, cause inadvertent opening, and/or injury to the end user. Thus, a need exists for an improved easy-open blister package that eliminates one or more of the aforementioned deficiencies.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A package for an oral care implement comprises, in one embodiment, a container having a display portion, a periphery and an interior for receiving an oral care implement, a backing attached to the container and further comprising a first portion attached to a portion of the periphery for enclosing the interior and a second portion attached to the display portion; wherein the second portion of the backing further comprises a separable portion that facilitates separation of the first portion of the backing from the display portion to thereby facilitate access to the interior of the container. In one embodiment, the severing or separation of the second portion of the backing relative to the first portion of the backing results in the initial opening along the periphery and access to the interior, and facilitates the subsequent removal of the first portion of the backing from the periphery of the container.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to an oral care implement including a capillary delivery system for a fluid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, particularly toothbrushes, are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristle section followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue, and/or gums. Some toothbrushes have been equipped with fluid reservoirs and systems for delivering auxiliary active agents, such as whitening agents, breath freshening agents, and the like. There is a continuing need for alternative oral care implements for delivering auxiliary active agents.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement having a capillary delivery system. Optionally, the oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements on a first surface thereof.

In one embodiment, an oral care implement includes a reservoir containing at least one active agent. A variety of active agents can be administered for therapeutic, hygienic, and/or other benefits, such as fresh breath, tooth whitening, or producing sensations of heat, cool, or tingling.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement includes a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets. In one embodiment, an outlet is located on a second surface of the head generally opposite the first surface that contains the tooth cleaning elements.

In yet another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir for storing a fluid containing at least one active agent, and an overflow chamber. The reservoir and overflow chamber may be separated by a partition. A capillary channel constructed from a fibrous material, ceramic, porous plastic, or combination thereof extends through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets.

In another embodiment, an oral care implement has a head containing tooth cleaning elements, a reservoir containing at least one active agent, a capillary channel extending through at least a portion of the implement to deliver the active agent to one or more outlets, and a motion-producing device. When activated, the motion-producing device vibrates the implement or a portion thereof, such as the head portion. The vibration enhances the function of the tooth cleaning elements and also promotes delivery of the active agent through the capillary channel, which together provides an enhanced cleaning action.

"BACKGROUND

Oral health problems can take many forms, such as tooth decay, periodontal disease, and bad breath. Bacteria play a major role in many oral health issues. For example, tooth decay and periodontal disease are often caused by undesirable bacteria in the mouth. Bacteria also interact with proteins present in saliva to form a film (plaque) that coats the teeth. If this plaque is not removed, acids produced by the bacteria can attack the teeth resulting in tooth decay. The plaque also may attack the soft gum tissue of the mouth leading to tooth loss in adults.

Oral care agents, such as rinses and mouthwashes, serve to remove bacteria and supply breath freshening agents. However, people do not always implement effective oral care procedures when using these liquids. Thus, significant amounts of harmful bacteria may remain in the mouth, attacking the teeth and gums, even after the person has completed his/her oral care routines.

Prior attempts at oral healthcare detection systems have not met with widespread adoption and have had limited functionality. For example, test strips employing conventional approaches for diagnosing the risk of dental caries using antibodies to detect the presence of oral bacteria have not achieved commercial success or widespread adoption by the public. Moreover, systems using color as an indicator of the presence of particular bacteria or enzymes have been burdened by the need for additional processing or apparatus, e.g., a colorimeter or fluorometer, to develop the color. In addition to the inconvenience of performing multiple steps, the use of additional agents and equipment may increase risk and increases cost.

Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method and apparatus capable of overcoming the disadvantages described herein at least to some extent.

SUMMARY

In some embodiments, the present invention provides an oral device, comprising: a detector capable of detecting a marker of an oral condition; an agent capable of indicating the existence of an oral condition, wherein said agent is disposed within a releaser; and a releaser, configured to release said agent in response to a marker being detected by said detector.

Some embodiments provide an oral device, comprising: a detector capable of detecting a marker of an oral condition; a self-contained indicator disposed on a head of the oral device, wherein said indicator is actuated by a signal from the detector.

Further embodiments provide an oral system, comprising: an oral device configured for introduction into an oral cavity of a user; a detector capable of detecting a marker of an oral condition; an agent capable of indicating the existence of an oral condition, wherein said agent is disposed within a releaser; and a releaser, configured to release said agent in response to a marker being detected by said detector.

Other embodiments of the invention provide an oral system, comprising: an oral device, wherein said oral device comprises: a detector capable of detecting a marker of an oral condition; a self-contained indicator disposed on a head of the oral device, wherein said indicator is actuated by a signal from the detector.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Aspects of the present disclosure relate to consumer products, including toothbrushes, and more particularly to a removable audio output module that can record and/or play music or other audio signals for use with various consumer products.

A small percentage of the population brushes their teeth for the dentist-recommended time of two minutes. This can be especially true of younger children and teenagers, who view tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects.

In addition, healthy cleaning habits should extend beyond teeth cleaning. Recursive tasks such as washing dishes, cleaning a house, shampooing, and shaving, may be rushed and/or even neglected since little to no pleasure is often associated with them.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"BACKGROUND

Oral health problems can take many forms, such as tooth decay, periodontal disease, and bad breath. Bacteria plays a major role in many oral health issues. For example, tooth decay and periodontal disease are often caused by undesirable bacteria in the mouth. Bacteria also interact with proteins present in saliva to form a film, known as plaque, that coats the teeth. If this plaque is not removed, acids produced by the bacteria can attack the teeth resulting in tooth decay. The plaque also may attack the soft gum tissue of the mouth leading to tooth loss in adults.

Prior attempts at oral healthcare detection systems have been widely adopted and have had limited functionality. For example, test strips employing conventional approaches for diagnosing the risk of dental caries using antibodies to detect the presence of oral bacteria have not achieved commercial success or widespread adoption by the public. Moreover, systems using color as an indicator of the presence of particular bacteria or enzymes have been burdened by the need for additional processing or apparatus, e.g., a colorimeter or fluorometer, to develop the color. In addition to the inconvenience of performing multiple steps, the use of additional agents and equipment may increase risk and increases cost.

SUMMARY

Some embodiments of the present invention provide a device for identifying the existence of an oral condition, comprising: a vessel for collecting a sample from the oral cavity; a detector capable of detecting the existence of a marker within said sample; and an indicator capable of being actuated by a signal from the detector.

Further embodiments provide a method for identifying the existence of an oral condition in a subject comprising: collecting a sample from the oral cavity of a subject using a vessel; detecting the existence of one or more markers in the sample; and indicating the existence of at least one of the one or more markers to the subject.

"FIELD

This application is directed to flexible packaging and more particularly to flexible bags and other packages having a feature for controlling access to the package and its contents.

BACKGROUND

Candy and other food products are often packaged in bulk and consumed incrementally over time. Consumers prefer such packages be closed when not being actively consumed to maintain freshness, encourage portion control, and to prevent accidental spillage during handling and/or storage. In some cases, the reclosure of a package may be achieved by the use of a separate clip provided by the consumer and affixed to the bag. Zipper closures incorporated directly in the package are also commonly used as a reclosure feature.

Among the drawbacks of current package reclosure features are that the consumer often does not consider the need for a clip until after the bag is open. The consumer then must search for the clip among a drawer full of odds and ends while trying not to spill the contents of the now-opened package. Zipper closures formed as part of the package can be slightly more handy, but are expensive to produce. Zipper closures also present consumers difficulties in the visual or palpable determination whether a proper closure has been achieved until after the packages is in a position that would result in spillage if the zipper was not properly closed.

Furthermore, current reclosure features are provided to achieve only that limited purpose. They do not act as a true access control feature that can also aid in keeping the package open when its contents are desired to be consumed.

These and other drawbacks are found in current product packaging.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to flexible packaging that contains an access control feature for reclosing the packaging in a robust, repeatable manner that provides a readily identifiable way for a consumer to conclude the package is safely closed. In certain embodiments, the access control feature further assists in keeping the package open for easy access where, for example, repeated servings are likely to occur in short succession. Exemplary embodiments employ one or more strips formed of a malleable sheet of material capable of maintaining a dead fold incorporated into the package.

According to an embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of a malleable sheet material attached to the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package.

According to another embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of metallic foil attached to the first package side wall, extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package and the strip of metallic foil is oriented substantially horizontally with respect to the mouth of the packaging, the strip of metallic foil having a fold guide formed therein comprising a score extending linearly across the strip of the metallic foil.

According yet another embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of metallic foil attached to the first package side wall and extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package. The strip of the metallic foil is oriented substantially vertically with respect to the mouth of the packaging, the strip of metallic foil having a plurality of fold guides formed therein, each fold guide comprising a score extending linearly along the width of the strip of metallic foil, whereby the fold guides are oriented substantially horizontally with the mouth of the packaging.

In one embodiment, a flexible package comprises a first package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface; a second package side wall having an external surface and an internal surface, the second package side wall opposing the first package side wall such that the internal surfaces of the first and second package side walls face toward one another; and a strip of a polymer coated metallic foil heat sealed to a surface of the first package side wall, the foil extending from a first edge of the first package side wall to a second edge of the first package side wall, the foil having a thickness in the range of about 0.003 inches to about 0.005 inches. An edge portion of the first package side wall is sealed to an edge portion of the second package side wall to form a seam, the first package side wall and the second package side wall further forming a mouth of the package. The strip of foil is oriented substantially horizontally with respect to the mouth of the package, the foil having a fold guide formed therein comprising a score extending linearly substantially parallel to the mouth of the package.

An advantage is that a flexible package is provided that is easy to close and operates in an intuitive manner, while providing visual assurance that the package has been closed.

Another advantage is that incorporation of a fold guide into the strip of the malleable sheet material provides a tactile cue to the user for properly closing the package.

Yet another advantage is that the use of the strip of malleable sheet material can also be used to maintain the mouth of the package open for easier access to its contents.

Still another advantage is that exemplary embodiments of the invention may be less expensive to produce than packages with zipper style closures, while still providing an integrated closure feature.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are cellular byproducts formed by the metabolism of oxygen, are responsible for cell oxidative damages, and can be the cause of cellular injury, cellular dysfunction, and cell death (apoptosis). The effects of ROS on cell metabolism have been well documented. Accumulation of ROS in tissue may cause oxidative injury, and thus it may be desirable to reduce the amounts of ROS in tissues. It is desirable to monitor ROS generation in cells to determine whether ROS are involved in diseases including cardiovascular, inflammatory, and infectious diseases. Cells normally are capable of preventing oxidative damage from ROS with enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase or catalase. Other compounds also are useful in preventing such damage, including antioxidants such as vitamins, uric acid, and glutathione. Such compounds, (e.g., antioxidants), may play an important role in scavenging free radicals and protecting the host organism from pathogens.

Although many methods have been developed to measure ROS quantities in tissue, there are few methods that measure intracellular ROS concentrations in real time. The ability to measure ROS quantities is important, in that ROS concentrations may change, e.g., increase or decrease, over time.

Accordingly, there is a continuing interest in developing and administering effective antioxidant compositions to prevent ROS damage. There are few methods, however, that are capable of measuring the effects of compositions on ROS production in real time. It therefore would be desirable to develop methods that can measure the effects of components on intracellular ROS production.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In accordance with certain embodiments, a method is provided that can be utilized to measure intracellular ROS concentrations in real time. The method of the embodiments may be useful in determining the effects of test components on intracellular ROS production and oxidative stress on a cell. The methods also may be useful to determine the ability of test components to reduce ROS components in a cell, in which the ROS which may be endogenous or exogenous to the cell.

Thus, certain embodiments described herein include a method of measuring the effect a test component has on the production of ROS in a cell. The method includes contacting a cell with a material capable of fluorescence, contacting the cell with a test component, contacting the cell with an ROS or an ROS stimulant, and measuring cell fluorescence. The embodiments further include measuring cell fluorescence after contacting the cell with the material capable of fluorescence and either an ROS or an ROS stimulant, measuring cell fluorescence after contacting the cell with a test component, comparing the two fluorescence values and determining whether the test component reduced ROS.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for detecting luteinizing hormone (LH) in a biological sample.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Just prior to ovulation, women experience a short surge where the luteinizing hormone (LH) level rises to a significantly higher level relative to one's baseline, or normal circulating, LH level. As such, ovulation predictor tests are configured for the detection of this LH surge to facilitate the prediction of when a woman will ovulate. Generally, most women will ovulate within 24 to 36 hours after an LH surge is detected. A reliable method of predicting ovulation can determine a woman's fertility period for pregnancy. As such, ovulation predictor kits/devices must provide unambiguous test results (i.e., surge or no surge) to accurately facilitate the prediction of ovulation in a timely manner.

Ovulation predictor kits/devices currently available provide test results that can be difficult to interpret by a user due at least in part to the nature in which these test results are conveyed to the user. That is, ovulation predictor tests generally require the user to compare the resulting color intensities of the test line and reference line. In many instances, these devices are deemed to indicate LH surge when the test line exhibits a color intensity equal to or greater than the color intensity exhibited by the reference line. Accordingly, interpretation of these test results is necessarily subjective. For instance, as a user approaches the time of her LH surge the test results provided by these “color matching/comparing” devices become increasingly vague and subjective since the respective color intensities of the test and reference lines are increasingly similar. As such, the user is left to interpret as to whether the respective color intensities are truly indicative of an LH surge or not. This inherent guesswork can often result in the user missing the detection of her LH surge. The inability to timely identify an LH surge renders pinpointing ovulation undesirably difficult.

As such, there remains a need for a reliable ovulation predictor device that provides test results that can be less subjectively interpreted by a user, particularly by a user in her home.

"BACKGROUND

This application relates to oral and personal care compositions, and more particularly to compositions comprising a film entrained in a carrier, in which the film includes a relatively high concentration of zinc-containing compound. Such compositions include, for example, dentifrices.

The aesthetic appeal of such compositions is important, and can have significant effects on consumer acceptance and usage. Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products. Indeed, many such compositions known in the art are deficient in one or more attributes.

Compositions for enhancing health, hygiene or appearance, such as oral care compositions, skin care compositions and hair care compositions, are used by millions of people. These compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including for enhancing personal health, hygiene, and appearance, as well as for preventing or treating a variety of diseases and other conditions in humans and in animals.

The formulation of such compositions presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Compositions that contain therapeutic active materials preferably deliver the active at effective levels, avoiding undue chemical degradation. Similarly, compositions containing cosmetically functional materials must deliver the material to, e.g., the oral cavity, skin or hair at effective levels under the conditions that they are typically used by the consumer.

Water-soluble films for oral administration of therapeutic agents are well known in the art. It is also known in the no to use such films for administering a breath freshening agent, e.g., menthol. The known films for administering breath freshening agents and/or active pharmaceutical agents are generally comprised of at least one water-soluble polymer suitable for human consumption and at least one compound that enhances the wettability of the water-soluble polymer, typically selected from polyalcohols, surfactants and plasticizers. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,948,430, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes a monolayer film that can be adhered to the oral cavity to release a pharmaceutically or cosmetically active ingredient, wherein the film comprises at least one water-soluble polymer; at least one member selected from the group consisting of a polyalcohol, a surfactant and a plasticizer; at least one cosmetic or pharmaceutically active ingredient; and a flavoring agent.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,700,478, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes a laminated device for controlled release of a substance within a mucosa-lined body cavity including a water-soluble adhesive layer comprised of a water-soluble polymer and a water-soluble plasticizer, and a water-soluble polymer layer. This patent teaches a multiple layer laminate that dissolves relatively slowly for controlled or sustained release of a substance.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,900,552, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, describes a trilaminate film suitable for prolonged and sustained delivery of an active ingredient in a buccal cavity. The trilaminate includes a hydratable muco-adhesive base layer; a non-adhesive reservoir layer; and a water-impermeable barrier sandwiched between and bonded to the base layer and the reservoir layer. This patent discloses slowly disintegrating films for prolonged or sustained release of a substance.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,047,244, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a therapeutic dosage form comprising an anhydrous but hydratable monolithic polymer matrix that contains amorphous fumed silica as well as a therapeutic agent, and a water-insoluble barrier layer secured to the polymer matrix and defining a non-adhesive face. This patent does not disclose rapidly disintegrating films, but instead contemplates compositions that are capable of providing improved availability of therapeutic agents from a controlled release muco-adhesive carrier system.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,669,929, and U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0053962, the disclosures of each of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, disclose film forming agents useful in oral care compositions. The films dissolve in the mouth and release functional components, typically flavorants.

It is known to incorporate flavorants, colorants, and some active components in films that dissolve in the oral cavity. These films are used either by themselves as breath freshening strips, teeth whitening strips, or as polymer flakes dispersed throughout an oral care composition. It also is known to incorporate zinc salts in dentifrice formulations. Use of various zinc salts often is limited by the solubility of the zinc, undesirable consumer astringency when higher levels of zinc are utilized, and the reactivity of the zinc once zinc ions that are available for reaction (i.e., the zinc ions sometimes cause adverse reactions within the formulation).

Thus, there is an ongoing need for new oral and personal care compositions, and methods of their use.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides, in various embodiments, oral and personal care compositions comprising a film entrained in a carrier, in which the film includes a relatively high concentration of a zinc-containing compound. In one embodiment, the film is provided as a plurality of film fragments. In various embodiments, the present invention provides compositions comprising a plurality of lamellar fragments in a carrier.

In one embodiment, the oral care composition comprises a film entrained in a carrier, in which a zinc-containing compound is contained in the film in an amount from about 35% by weight to about 60% by weight. Increasing the solid loading in the film formula increases the delivery of actives per area which is important for delivering superior efficacy.

The embodiments also provide methods for making the film and methods for administering a zinc-containing compound to a human or animal subject in need thereof, the method including topically applying to the subject an oral care composition comprising a film entrained in a carrier, a zinc-containing compound contained in the film, a polysaccharide, and a maleic anhydride copolymer. In various methods, such methods further comprise disrupting the film after the topical application.

Compositions and methods of this invention afford benefits over compositions and methods among those known in the art. Such benefits include one or more of increased consumer acceptability, improved amounts of available zinc, decreased adverse reactions brought about by the presence of zinc ions, enhanced aesthetics, improved stability for active or other functional materials, and controlled delivery of active materials such as zinc. Further benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a method for assessing perspiration reduction of compositions

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

For antiperspirant products, their efficacy can be measured using the procedure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which is described in 21 CFR 350 and its subparts and in Guidelines for Effectiveness Testing of OTC Antiperspirant Drug Products (http:www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm106437.pdf). This method describes how to apply an antiperspirant to a test subject and have the test subject sit in a hot room to measure the level of perspiration. The level of perspiration reduction is compared to an area on the test subject where no antiperspirant was applied or a control formulation was applied.

This method requires an absorbent pad to be applied to a test area to collect perspiration. The absorbent pad in the test area is compared to the control area to determine the difference in the level of perspiration between the two areas.

One drawback to this method is that the absorbent pad is in direct contact with the area where the composition is applied to the skin. While traditional antiperspirants work by penetrating the pores and forming a plug thus not remaining on the surface of skin, other compositions that can be used to reduce perspiration, such as occlusives or film formers, work by forming a layer on skin. When the absorbent pad comes into contact with the composition, the absorbent pad may remove some or all of the composition. This leads to an inaccurate result for the test. It would be desirable to have a test method that does not interfere with the test composition.

Another drawback is that the test requires a full clinical study, which is costly and time consuming. It would desirable to have a method that can be used in the laboratory to screen compositions to save time and money.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Provided is a method to assess perspiration reduction of a composition comprising obtaining an amount of water in stratum corneum in a first area of skin on an individual using confocal Raman spectroscopy, applying a composition to the first area of skin on the individual, having the individual perform an activity to cause the individual to perspire, and obtaining an amount of water in stratum corneum in the first area of skin on the individual after the activity using confocal Raman spectroscopy.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND

Precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is manufactured on a commercial scale for use in a variety of industrial, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. Generally, precipitated calcium carbonate is made by heating crushed limestone at high temperatures, breaking the raw calcium carbonate into lime (CaO) and carbon dioxide gas (CO2). Addition of the water to the lime (a process called “slaking”) yields Ca(OH2). The slaked lime (or “milk of lime”) is treated with carbon dioxide gas. The resulting calcium carbonate precipitates from the aqueous solution, yielding a slurry of precipitated calcium carbonate that can be neutralized, milled, filtered, dewatered and/or dried, as desired.

Slurries of precipitated calcium carbonate are susceptible to microorganisms. To deter microorganisms, a preservative such an aldehyde can be added to the slurry. For example, U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2009/0088483 discloses combinations of a dialdehyde (such as glutaraldehyde) and a formaldehyde-releasing agent such as (ethylenedioxy)dimethanol. Unfortunately, these preservatives have their limitations. Glutaraldehyde, for example, is unstable at alkaline pH, and is therefore ineffective as a long-term preservative. Furthermore some bacterial strains metabolize formaldehyde (see, for example, Di Maiuta et al. (2009)International Biodeterioration&Biodegradation63:769-777), permitting bacterial growth even in a treated PCC slurry.

There is a need for improved preservation methods for precipitated calcium carbonate compositions.

SUMMARY

Polymeric biguanides can effectively preserve oral care compositions that include precipitated calcium carbonate. The polymeric biguanide provides lasting antimicrobial action without requiring an aldehyde-based preservative.

Thus, in one aspect, a dry precipitated calcium carbonate composition for use in oral care, or in the manufacture of an oral care composition. The dry precipitated calcium carbonate composition includes, in addition to the precipitated calcium carbonate, a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide.

Also provided are precipitated calcium carbonate slurries for use in oral care or in the manufacture of an oral care composition. The slurry includes water, precipitated calcium carbonate, and a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide. The slurry is optionally free of other preservatives, such as formaldehyde. The slurry can include one or more other oral care ingredients, such as humectants, inorganic dispersants, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, anticaries agents, anticalculus agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, breath fresheners, antiplaque agents, enzymes, vitamins, anti-adhesion agents and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, the concentration of the polymeric biguanide does not exceed 0.04%. For example, in certain embodiments the concentration is between 0.01% and 0.04%.

Also provided are methods of preparing an oral care composition. The methods include combining a pre-formed complex of precipitated calcium carbonate and a polymeric biguanide such as polyhexamethylene biguanide with a composition that includes one or more oral care ingredients chosen from humectants, inorganic dispersants, bicarbonate salts, pH modifying agents, surfactants, foam modulators, thickening agents, viscosity modifiers, sweeteners, flavorants, colorants, anticaries agents, anticalculus agents, stannous ion sources, zinc ion sources, breath fresheners, antiplaque agents, enzymes, vitamins, anti-adhesion agents and combinations thereof.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Stannous salts such as stannous fluoride are used in dentifrices as agents for preventing plaque. However, some disadvantages of stannous salts include instability, tendency to stain teeth, astringency and unpleasant taste for users. For that reason, oral care compositions containing stannous salts such as stannous fluoride are often presented as dual phase compositions, in which the stannous salt is kept separate from the other components in order to reduce its negative effects on the oral cavity, such as astringency and unpleasant taste. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,521,216 and 7,063,833, both to Glandorf et al.

Sodium tripolyphosphate is an effective anticalculus (anti-tartar) agent, but the compound is not generally compatible with stannous salts in long term storage (such as that normally sustained in the lifetime of a tube of toothpaste between time of packaging and time of discard after use). In particular, the combination of sodium tripolyphosphate with stannous salts such as stannous fluoride can lead to undesirable stannous tripolyphosphate intermediates.

Accordingly, there is an ongoing need for oral care compositions that have improved efficacy in combating plaque and tooth discoloration and are still able to retain long-term stability.

"TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to the field of toothbrushes, and more particularly, the invention relates to the field of electrically powered toothbrushes.

BACKGROUND

Toothbrushes have traditionally utilized one or more groups of bristles that are fixed or otherwise attached to the head or end of the toothbrush. Toothbrushes are also known to utilize movable bristle sets or bristle holders that are mechanically or electrically powered. Generally, a significant cleaning efficacy results from a toothbrush that utilizes a combination of fixed bristles and moveable bristles. Typically, for example, an electrical motor and drive mechanism are retained within the body of the toothbrush and are coupled to the movable bristle sets or bristle holders. Upon activation of the motor and drive mechanism, the bristle holders may undergo a variety of different types of motion. Further, typically for example one or more batteries are also provided within the body of the toothbrush to power the drive mechanism and impart motion to the bristle holder.

The mechanisms used to impart motion to the bristle holders often utilize complicated, expensive and in many instances precision gearing mechanisms to move the bristle holder with a desired motion.

What is needed therefore is an electric toothbrush with a combination of fixed bristles and movable bristles that provides motion to a movable bristle holder without complicated, expensive and precision gearing mechanisms.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to methods of treating a solid surface to kill and/or prevent mold growth by applying onto the surface a novel aqueous silane quaternary ammonium composition.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as the public becomes aware that exposure to mold can cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms. Molds can produce allergens that can trigger allergic reactions or even asthma attacks in people allergic to mold. Other molds are known to produce potent toxins and/or irritants. Potential health concerns are an important reason to prevent mold growth and to remediate/clean up any existing indoor mold growth. Molds can also hasten the deterioration of surfaces and structural components of buildings.

Molds reproduce by making spores that usually cannot be seen without magnification. Mold spores waft through the indoor and outdoor air continually. When mold spores land on a damp area, the spores may begin growing and digesting whatever media such as spores are growing on in order to survive. Molds gradually destroy the area on which the spores grow.

Mold spores can be found in the air and on nearly every surface in a home, but generally a consistent source of moisture is required for mold to grow. Molds can grow on virtually any organic substance, as long as moisture and oxygen are present. There are molds that can grow on wood, paper, ceramic, concrete, plastics, textiles, and foods.

Many types of molds exist. Molds such as mold, fungus mold, and slime molds are most often found in areas that have high humidity levels such as bathrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms or damp basements (especially after flooding). Outdoor structures that are often wetted or remain damp are also areas of mold growth. Thus, roofs, fences, porches, pools and the like are often damaged by continual mold growth. Molds are a type of microscopic fungus that can grow naturally indoors and outdoors. The most common household mold types includeAspergillus, Cladosporium, PenicilliumandAlternaria. Stachybotrys chartarum, often referred to as black mold, is less common than the molds listed above and is the type of mold commonly dealt with in home remediations.

Antimicrobial agents are chemical compositions that are used to prevent microbiological contamination and deterioration of products, materials, and systems. Of the diverse categories of antimicrobial agents and compositions, quaternary ammonium compounds represent one of the largest of the classes of agents in use. At low concentrations, quaternary ammonium type antimicrobial agents are bacteriostatic, fungistatic, algistatic, sporostatic, and tuberculostatic. At medium concentrations they are bactericidal, fungicidal, algicidal, and viricidal against lipophilic viruses. Silicone containing quaternary ammonium compounds are well known as exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 3,560,385, and the use of such compounds as antimicrobial agents is taught, for example, in a wide variety of patents such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,730,701, and 3,817,739, where the compounds are used to inhibit algae; U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,794,736 and 3,860,709 where they are employed for sterilizing or disinfecting a variety of surfaces and instruments; U.S. Pat. No. 3,865,728, where the compounds are used to treat aquarium filters; U.S. Pat. No. 4,259,103; and in British Patent No. 1,386,876. Published unexamined European Application No. 228464 of Jul. 15, 1987, teaches that microorganisms on plants can be killed by the application thereto of an aqueous mixture of a surfactant and an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a particular application of an antimicrobial silicone quaternary ammonium compound, a paper substrate is rendered resistant to the growth of microorganisms in U.S. Pat. No. 4,282,366. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,504,541, an antimicrobial fabric is disclosed which is resistant to discoloration and yellowing by treatment of the fabric with a quaternary ammonium base containing an organosilicone. U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,937, as well as its companion U.S. Pat. No. 4,692,374, relate to wet wiper towelettes having an antimicrobial agent substantive to the fibers of the web and being an organosilicon quaternary ammonium compound. In a series of patents assigned to Burlington Industries, Inc. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,408,996, 4,414,268, 4,425,372, and 4,395,454, such compounds are disclosed to be useful in surgical drapes, dressings, and bandages. This same assignee also discloses these compounds as being employed in surgeons' gowns in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,411,928 and 4,467,013. Organosilicon quaternary ammonium compounds have been employed in carpets in U.S. Pat. No. 4,371,577; applied to walls, added to paints, and sprayed into shoes, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,394,378; applied to polyethylene surfaces and used in pillow ticking in U.S. Pat. No. 4,721,511; in flexible polyurethane foams of fine-celled, soft, resilient articles of manufacture in U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,297; and mixed with a nonionic surfactant in Japanese Kokai Application No. 60-048908, filed Aug. 26, 1983, of Sanyo Chemical Industries, Ltd., for the purpose of achieving uniformity of distribution of compounds to a textile surface. Thus the versatility of such compositions is readily apparent.

For organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n is an integer from 0 to 2, hydrolysis of the first two X groups with water produces a species bearing —Si(OH)2— units which can self-condense through the hydroxyl moieties to linear and/or cyclic oligomers possessing the partial structure HO—Si—(O—Si)mm—O—Si—O—Si—O—Si—OH, where mm is an integer such that an oligomer is formed. For those cases, RSiX3, hydrolysis of the third X group generates a silanetriol (RSi(OH)3) which produces insoluble organosilicon polymers through linear and/or cyclic self-condensation of the Si(OH) units. This water induced self-condensation generally precludes storage of most organosilanes RnSiX4-n, where n ranges from 0 to 2, inclusive, in water. Except for some organosilanes which can be stable in very dilute solutions at specific pH ranges, the use of water solutions of most organosilanes require the use of freshly prepared solutions. Quaternary ammonium organosilanes are often applied from solvent solutions such as lower alcohols and the commercial versions of these quaternized organosilanes are commonly provided as methanolic solutions.

Quaternary ammonium functional organosilanes containing hydrolyzable groups such as those sold under the trademark DOW CORNING® 5772 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride) by Dow Corning Corporation of Midland, Mich. and REQUAT® 1977 (3-(trimethoxysilyl)propylmethyldi(decyl)ammonium chloride) by Sanitized, Inc. of New Preston, Conn. have found a large number of uses because of their ability to attach themselves to a wide variety of substrates where the quaternary ammonium functional group then acts as an antimicrobial and algicidal agent. Substrates treated with such quaternized organosilanes have also been noted to, among other things, be easier to clean, possess soil release properties, and cause hair to exhibit a conditioned appearance.

A clear microemulsion of a quaternized organosilane using a cosurfactant having an HLB value of at least 1 is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 4,842,766 to Blehm et al. This patent teaches that the methanol-based solvent in which the organosilane is supplied must be removed before blending the quaternized organosilane with the cosurfactant (e.g., a nonionic surfactant can used). If the methanol is not removed, a creamy white emulsion forms which is unstable and will separate into oil and water phases over time. The '766 patent also teaches that high shear may have to be applied to the mixtures of organosilane and cosurfactant to ensure codispersion.

Obviously, this has the disadvantage of requiring a homogenization step to prepare such microemulsions. Blehm et al. teach that almost any surfactant can be employed including anionic, cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as well as nonionic surfactants although nonionic surfactants and compounds such as glycerol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and higher monoalcohols such as pentanol, decanol and decanediol are most preferred.

Another patent teaching oil-in-water emulsions containing 3-(trimethoxysilyl)propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride as well as, optionally, cosurfactants such as nonionic and cationic surfactants, is U.S. Pat. No. 4,631,273 to Blehm et al. These emulsions employ a homogenizer using high shear conditions and teach that the quaternized organosilane does not hydrolyze while it is in emulsion form and thus does not polymerize to an insoluble siloxane. The Examples use ARQUAD® T27W cationic surfactant which is trimethyl tallow ammonium chloride. However, these emulsions also require a water immiscible liquid such as a polydimethylsiloxane or a mineral oil with which the quaternized organosilane associates. Blehm et al. teach that a sufficient shear force is necessary to form the emulsions and that an Eppenbach mixer did not provide a sufficient amount of such shear.

Therefore, there exists a need for extended shelf life, water-stable organosilane compounds, such as silane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions thereof that, upon application, the active portion of the organosilane is operative for the selected application. Moreover, there exists a need for water-stable, organosilane quaternary ammonium compounds, products and compositions which are essentially non-toxic, non-flammable, uniformly dispersable, and simple and economical to manufacture and use.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an aqueous composition comprising an organosilane quaternary ammonium component, a nonionic surfactant component, and, optionally, an alkali bicarbonate component for treating a surface susceptible to mold to prevent mold formation. The aqueous composition of this invention is devoid of other polysiloxanes, has a long, stable shelf life, can be readily applied to any surface, and dries quickly once applied. The composition can be made by directly mixing the alcoholic solution of the organosilane quaternary compound to water without the need for removing the alcohol. Once in solution, the composition remains stable even if exposed to air until it is applied, and then dries quickly. The addition of surfactant allows the composition to be applied evenly across any surface. The alkali metal bicarbonate improves the antimicrobial properties of the composition and improves the drying time of the applied composition. The composition can be applied to a surface by any conventional coating method, such as by spraying, wiping, roller coating and the like.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

The present application is a U.S. national stage application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of PCT Application No. PCT/CN2010/002109, filed Dec. 21, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements having a flexible head formed by a plurality of segments.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes having a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice is often spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process, the industry continues to pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the existing technology.

A number of attempts have been made to create flexible toothbrush heads that provide greater cleaning efficacy by allowing the head to flex, thereby allowing the bristles and other tooth cleaning elements to extend at various angles relative to one another. In one type of known flexible toothbrush head, the head is broken up into a plurality of segments that are flexible relative to one another and relative to the handle. However, the existing designs of many segmented toothbrush heads result in the head having either too much or not enough flexibility. Too much flexibility results in the head being unable to transmit sufficient pressure to the teeth or other oral surfaces via the bristles when the handle is subject to normal brushing forces. On the other hand, inadequate flexibility results in the segments (and thus the bristles) remaining substantially stationary, thereby defeating the purpose of having a flexible head.

More recently, the strategic arrangement and combination of tooth cleaning elements in the form of elastomeric cleaning elements and bristle tufts has become a more common way of improving cleaning efficiency. However, very little efforts have been made to coordinate the structure and arrangement of elastomeric cleaning elements on flexible toothbrush heads formed by a plurality of segments.

Elastomeric soft tissue cleaners, which are typically located on the rear surface of the toothbrush head, have also become quite popular. However, as with the tooth cleaning elements, very little effort has been expended to coordinate the structure of the soft tissue cleaner with the structure of flexible toothbrush heads utilizing a plurality of segments.

"BACKGROUND

The use of dental floss and other interdental cleaners are an important part of dental hygiene, and are used to remove plaque and other particulate from between the teeth and under the gum line, e.g., areas in the mouth where a toothbrush cannot reach. Frequently, these are the initiation sites of tooth decay, especially if not cleaned regularly. However, even with routine maintenance, caries and gingivitis still develop in these areas. Thus, there is a continuing need to develop more effective dental flosses.

Dental flosses are generally linear strips of a material having a fixed diameter and fixed dimensions. However, teeth are not all equally spaced apart. Thus, use of a dental floss that has a diameter less than the distance between the teeth results in inefficient or ineffective cleaning between the teeth. In addition, a space usually resides between the gum and two adjacent teeth that is usually larger than the diameter of dental floss, and efficient cleaning of such area is difficult. Dental floss users occasionally use dental floss to massage the gums, but dental flosses generally are hard when pulled taut, resulting in potential damage to the gum.

Solutions to overcome such problems include manufacturing dental flosses having a wider diameter. This may pose problems insofar as it may be difficult to pass larger diameter flosses, or even normal diameter flosses, between the teeth without a substantial increase of force. The force exerted to pass the floss between the teeth is immediately released once the floss passes between the teeth, usually resulting in a painful collision with the gums, and resulting in possible lacerations and bleeding. Also this “extra” force exerted to pass the floss between the teeth can cause the floss to shred and fray. Thus, small children may even be discouraged from flossing due to possible self-inflicted injuries.

Gelatinous elastomeric articles are known in the art, and often are used as handles for umbrellas, brushes, or for toys, dental floss, hand exercising grips, cushions, and the like. U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,334,646, and 5,508,334, the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety, discloses a gelatinous composition comprised of an intimate blend admixture of poly(styrene-ethylene-butylene-styrene) triblock copolymer with a high level of a plasticizing oil. These gelatinous polymers usually are too jelly-like and lack sufficient rigidity to be used in dental floss applications, because, inter alia, they tend to break too easily upon elongation (i.e., the tensile strength at break is too high, and the elongation at break is too low for practical use). U.S. Pat. No. 5,962,572, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses oriented gels useful in a variety of applications such as low frequency vibration applications, damping of mechanical structures, and the like.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,755,243, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss comprised of a fiber core, surrounded by an elastomeric outer layer. The outer layer provides a softer coating on a thicker floss used as a brush portion of a floss, but the floss itself is not stretchable due to the inner fiber core. A similar floss is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,797, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. U.S. Pat. No. 5,918,609, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety discloses particulate modified elastomeric flosses in which particulate modification agents are either adsorbed to the surface of the floss or embedded in the surface of the floss.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,941,256, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss having microcapsules associated with a portion of the floss that will burst and release a color to indicate use of the floss. U.S. Pat. No. 6,029,678, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a “gel” dental floss that comprises a core material and a gel material in which the core material provides for sufficient tensile strength and the gel component provides for softness of the floss. U.S. Pat. No. 6,161,555, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, discloses a dental floss in the form of a strand or tape made from gels having improved high tear strength and improved high tensile strength.

Despite the foregoing developments, there remains a need to develop dental floss compositions that solve such problems.

"The present invention relates to dentifrice compositions useful for cleaning teeth. In particular, the present invention includes two phase dentifrice compositions.

Oral care compositions are used for a wide variety of purposes, including for enhancing personal health, hygiene, and appearance, as well as for preventing or treating a variety of diseases and other conditions in humans and in animals.

The formulation of such compositions presents a number of challenges. They must be pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable for their intended use. Compositions that contain therapeutic active materials preferably deliver the active at effective levels, avoiding undue chemical degradation. Similarly, compositions containing cosmetically functional materials must deliver the material to the oral cavity at effective levels under the conditions that they are typically used by the consumer.

Moreover, the aesthetic appeal of all such compositions is important, and can have significant effects on consumer acceptance and usage. Aesthetic effects have been acknowledged to play an important role in consumer acceptance of many products. Although such products have met with consumer approval, the art seeks to further improve the aesthetic effects as well as the cosmetic and therapeutic benefits of these products. Indeed, many such compositions known in the art are deficient in one or more attributes. Thus, there is an ongoing need for new oral care compositions, and methods of their use.

A variety of active materials are disclosed in the art for use in oral care compositions, including fluoride salts and antimicrobial agents. Among the fluoride salts is stannous fluoride, which provides both fluoride ions for efficacy in prevention of tooth decay and stannous ions for efficacy in anti-plaque, anti-gingivitis, and hypersensitivity. While providing a number of benefits, however, stannous fluoride has a bitter salty (astringent) taste and is also only slightly soluble in water and accordingly does not readily dissociate to provide stannous ions. Stannous fluoride is therefore beneficially dissociated at a generally acidic pH. However, such a pH frustrates stability with other agents used in such compositions, such as the triclosan.

SUMMARY

The present invention provides oral care compositions. Embodiments include oral care compositions, comprising:a) a first phase comprising clinically efficacious 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenyl ether admixed in a first orally acceptable aqueous vehicle; and(b) a second phase comprising stannous salt admixed in a second orally acceptable aqueous vehicle; wherein(c) the second phase comprises no less than 10 molar percent of soluble stannous ion respective to a mathematical sum of moles of the soluble stannous ion and moles of the stannous salt in the second phase.

In one aspect, the first phase further comprises an antibacterial-enhancing agent. Preferably the first phase has a measured pH of from about 7 to about 9, and the second phase has a measured pH of from about 3 to about 8. In various embodiments, the enhancing agent is a methylvinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer. In one aspect of this, the methylvinyl ether-maleic anhydride copolymer antibacterial-enhancing agent has a molecular weight from about 100 to about 1,000,000.

In another aspect, the second phase further comprises polycarboxylic acid (preferably a food grade organic acid such as citric acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, gluconic acid, succinic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, or combinations thereof), preferably sufficient to effectively stabilize soluble stannous ion concentration in the second phase.

In one aspect the second phase further comprises polyphosphate salt (such as disodium pyrophosphate, dipotassium pyrophosphate, tetrapotassium pyrophosphate, tetrasodium pyrophosphate, or combinations thereof).

In yet other aspects, either or both of the first and second phases further comprise a either or both of silica and a surfactant, such as sodium lauryl sulfate.

In another aspect, an oral care kit having a first chamber with a first outlet in fluid communication with the first chamber for discharge of a first dentifrice from the first chamber and a second chamber with a second outlet in fluid communication with the second chamber for discharge of a second dentifrice from the second chamber is provided with the first and second chambers respectively containing the first phase and second phase of the above-described formulations as their respective dentifrice.

In another aspect, the above formulations are made through admixing a first dentifrice and a second dentifrice according to any above formulation, and then blending together an amalgam of the first dentifrice and the second dentifrice. In one aspect of this, the first dentifrice is stored in a first enclosure after being admixed; the second dentifrice is stored in a second enclosure after being admixed; and the blending is achieved by expelling the first dentifrice from the first enclosure and expelling the second dentifrice from the second enclosure so that the first dentifrice and the second dentifrice are expelled to provide the amalgam (such as toothpaste).

In yet another aspect, any above amalgam formulation is applied to the teeth of a human or other animal subject for the purpose of cleaning their teeth.

It has been discovered that compositions and methods of this invention afford advantages over oral care compositions among known in the art. Further uses, benefits and embodiments of the present invention are apparent from the description set forth herein.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

The present application is a national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2009/039198, filed Apr. 1, 2009, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention encompasses compositions and methods for treating and modifying surfaces of teeth, which compositions include calcium and magnesium containing silicates or silica, cationic polymer modified silica or combinations thereof. The composition when applied to the teeth or a tooth surface deposit on such surfaces to repair acid damaged enamel and prevent further erosion of a tooth surface.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental caries is initiated by localized demineralization of hard tissue of the teeth usually by organic acids produced from fermentation of dietary sugar by dental plaque or dentopathogenic bacteria. Even though the prevalence of dental caries has decreased using fluoride in most developed countries, the disease remains a major public health problem. Dental erosion is a chemically drive rapid, normally non-localized process resulting in the irreversible loss of tooth mineral by dietary or regurgitated acids. Gingivial recession abrasion and acid erosion are primary factors that can expose dentin tubules facilitating dentil hypersensitivity. Dental hypersensitivity is due to exposed dentinal tubules through loss of the protective mineralized layer, the cementum. Dental calculus is the unwanted accretion of calcium phosphate minerals on the tooth surface. All these conditions, dental caries, dental erosion, dental hypersensitivity and dental calculus are therefore imbalances in the level of calcium phosphates in the teeth.

Dental erosion may be caused by extrinsic or intrinsic factors. Extrinsic erosion is the result of oral consumption of dietary acids such as acidic beverages or fruit juices and environmental factors such as exposure to airborne contamination or acidic water.

The incidence and severity of dental erosion is on the rise with the increase in the consumption of acidic beverages and juices. The pH and titratable acidity of acidic beverages have been identified as the main causative agents in the initiation and progression of dental erosion. (See, e.g., Lussi, 1995, Caries Res.29, 349).

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The inventors have developed compositions and methods useful for treating or preventing dental erosion, particularly erosion of the enamel of a tooth or tooth surface.

The invention encompasses a chemical barrier technology that deposits minerals to damaged or softened enamel and forms a semi-impermeable matrix on the dentition. This unique surface matrix counteracts and protect the dentition from acid attack to reduce mineral loss and repair acid accelerated wear and structural depressions on the dentition surface In addition, the compositions of the invention provide barrier on the teeth or a tooth surface that acts as a proton sink to neutralize acid and prevent it from further dissolving native enamel.

In one embodiment, the invention encompasses dentifrice compositions including a cationically modified silica in an amount effective to treat or prevent erosive damage to an enamel surface of a tooth.

In another embodiment, the invention encompasses dentifrice compositions including calcium containing silicates and silica, magnesium-containing silicates and silica, and combinations thereof in an amount effective to treat or prevent erosive damage to an enamel surface of a tooth.

The invention also encompasses methods of treating or preventing erosive damage to an enamel surface of a tooth including administering to a subject in need thereof an effective amount of a composition comprising a cationically modified silica, calcium containing silicates and silica, magnesium containing silicates and silica, and combinations thereof.

These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from the following detailed description.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Cleaning compositions for use on hard surfaces are known in the art. Hard surfaces include household surfaces such as those typically found in bathrooms and kitchens, and include a variety of different materials such as enamel, ceramic, porcelain and the like. Such surfaces include fixtures such as countertops, appliances (e.g., refrigerators, stoves) as well as bathtubs, sinks, and toilets.

Acidic cleansers are known that purport to provide activity against mineral deposits, e.g., lime scale or soap scum. Some of these cleaners are marketed as being useful for limescale and rust removal, and are said to be dependent upon a certain pH range to retain the desired activity.

However, an ongoing need exists for improved hard surface cleaners that are effective at removing limescale, soap scum, rust, and other soil deposits from bathroom surfaces. In particular, cleaning compositions that are useful as toilet bowl cleaners (“TBCs”) are desirable. Because consumers are often reluctant to scrub toilet surfaces, cleaning compositions that are effective at removing solid and visible deposits such as soil and limescale from toilet bowls while requiring little or no follow-up scrubbing or wiping are especially desirable.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A cleaning composition comprising:(a) an organic acid;(b) a nonionic surfactant comprising an ethoxylated alcohol; and(c) a hydrophilic polymer that adsorbs to hard surfaces.

A composition useful for cleaning a bathroom or kitchen surface, comprising:(a) lactic acid and phosphoric acid in a weight ratio of about 1:3 to about 3:1;(b) a nonionic surfactant comprising a C9-C11alcohol with a degree of ethoxylation of about 7.5 to about 8.1;(c) about 0.1 to about 1% of an anti-adhesion polymer comprising a polybetaine;(d) optionally a thickener chosen from xanthan gum, gellan gum, carrageenan gum, hydroxyethylcellulose; and(e) about 85 to about 95% water;wherein the pH of the composition is 0 to about 3.

A composition useful for cleaning a bathroom or kitchen surface, comprising:(a) oxalic acid and formic acid in a weight ratio of about 1:2 to about 1:5;(b) a nonionic surfactant comprising a C9-C11alcohol with a degree of ethoxylation of about 7.5 to about 8.1;(c) about 0.1 to about 1% of an anti-adhesion polymer comprising a polybetaine;(d) optionally a thickener chosen from xanthan gum, gellan gum, carrageenan gum, hydroxyethylcellulose; and(e) about 85 to about 95% water;wherein the pH of the composition is 0 to about 3.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to oral care implements in general, and more particularly to a method of forming a light-emitting toothbrush.

BACKGROUND

Toothbrushes are generally made in a method in which nylon bristled stock is anchored to a plastic toothbrush head via a metal staple. This requires a minimum head thickness of around 5 millimeters in order to reduce the possibility of plastic breakage during the stapling process given the tuft densities of most standard brushes. Furthermore, the toothbrush head and handle is generally molded in one step and it is a solid plastic part. This does not lend itself to placement of a light source in the toothbrush head.

In another well known process called in-mold tufting (IMT), nylon bristles are gathered and placed in an injection mold. Plastic is then injected around the bristles forming the toothbrush head and handle. The head must be large enough that plastic can flow over and around the “fused balls of nylon” commonly seen in these type of processes. The plastic over the fused balls retains the tuft in the brush during normal use. Once again there are generally no allowances made for insertion of a light source.

In each of these methods, incorporating a light source requires a post-processing step, such that the head must be made to accommodate a light source or the transmission of light from a source outside of the head. This post-processing requires time and resources, and often increases the cost to an unacceptable level. Or as an alternative, it requires making the head at a greater thickness (allowing for creation of a hollow section) increasing discomfort for the user while decreasing the user's ease of maneuverability. Accordingly, there is a need, therefore, for a practical, cost-efficient method of forming a light-emitting oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, that has an acceptable thickness and that is comfortable to the user.

Such need is met using a method of making an oral care implement or toothbrush where, for example, a head plate and handle are molded separately. The head plate is filled with cleaning elements such as nylon and the nylon is melted to an extremely thin “mat”. Afterwards, this relatively thin head plate is ultrasonically welded to the handle. In this method there is an open cavity in the toothbrush head, or the toothbrush head is effectively hollow, allowing the opportunity to place light emitting elements or other items in the toothbrush head that may provide a therapeutic or cosmetic benefit. Included could be alarms or sonic other device that signal proper or improper brushing techniques, proper amount of brushing time, etc.

SUMMARY

An oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, comprises a head, a plurality of cleaning elements defined thereon, and a light source incorporated into or adjacent the head. The light source is incorporated into the implement prior to the incorporation of the cleaning elements for ease of manufacturing and a cost-effective, user-friendly assembly. The cleaning elements are preferably pre-formed and attached to the head after the light source so that the provision of the light source does not require any post-processing that might impair the integrity of the head or cleaning elements or unduly enlarge the bead so that it is uncomfortable to the user.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to toothbrushes.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Conventional toothbrushes usually include a substantially rigid head with an outer surface from which cleaning elements extend. Conventional cleaning elements include bristles arranged in bristle tufts, elastomeric members or other known cleaning elements. However, rigid portions of certain conventional toothbrush heads can prevent the cleaning elements from being comfortably received in the mouth, and thereby prevent effective cleaning of the oral cavity.

To eliminate the problems associated with large, rigid toothbrush heads, certain conventional toothbrush heads include flexible segments that allow carried cleaning elements to move relative to the head. However, these flexible segments may not fit comfortably within the mouth of the user. Similarly, because of the size and/or shape of the flexible segments, the heads may not be comfortably manipulated within the mouth of the user during cleaning. As a result, the toothbrush may not be used on a regular basis. Additionally, when introduced into the mouth, the toothbrush may not be used for a period of time sufficient to provide the person with effective oral cleaning. It is also possible that the cleaning elements may not be capable of reaching all intended portions of the mouth. This can result in poor oral hygiene that can cause tooth and/or gum disease.

A number of approaches have been taken in the prior art to provide flexibility to the bristles during use of a toothbrush. U.S. Pat. No. 5,970,564, for example, discloses a toothbrush having an elastomeric ridge wherein there is a center array of bristles and there is a side array of bristles mounted in elastomeric boots. A number of patents disclose a toothbrush head having sets of bristles, each of which is mounted to a non-rigid or elastic support element. Examples of these approaches are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,770,195, 2,244,098, 6,161,245 and 6,311,360 and in French Patent No. 38440.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care implements, and specifically to a handle of an oral care implement, such as toothbrushes, that comprises a body that appears to float within an aperture of the handle. The body can serve both a decorative and/or utilitarian function.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care implements, especially toothbrushes, are used by many people on a daily basis. Typical oral care implements comprise an elongated handle and a head connected to one end of the handle. The handle provides the structure by which the user grips and manipulates the oral care implement during use. The head typically comprises one or more elements designed to perform the intended function, such as teeth cleaning elements, soft tissues cleansers, and/or oral care agents.

Over the years, substantial efforts have been expended in improving the design of the handles of oral care implements for increased control, reduced damage to the oral surfaces, improved reach, and aesthetic desirability. Such efforts have included the development of handles having multiple components, including a hard core structure and soft gripping covers and grip bodies. Other existing handles have sections oriented at different angles relative to one another and the head.

Furthermore, the art has also recognized that it can often be difficult to convince a child to brush his/her teeth willingly. Thus, efforts have been made to create handles that include ornamental features that increase the desirability of children to use the oral care implement. Such efforts include molding the handle into a desired shape or character, providing aesthetically pleasing covers, providing toys within the handle, and/or incorporating electronically interactive devices within the handle.

Despite these efforts, a need still exists for an oral care implement that has a handle that provides greater design flexibility, creates an improved aesthetic appearance, affords improved control and/or reach, reduces damage to the oral surface, and/or improves the experience of an oral care session.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In one aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle having a longitudinal axis, a first surface, and a second surface opposite the first surface; a head connected to the handle; an aperture forming a passageway through the handle from the first surface to the second surface; a bulbous body positioned within the aperture; and at least one strut extending from the sidewall of the aperture, the bulbous body connected to a distal end of the strut so that the bulbous body is supported within the aperture so as to be spaced from the sidewall of the aperture by an annular gap.

In another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle having a longitudinal axis, a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface; a head connected to the handle; an aperture forming a passageway through the handle from the first surface to the second surface; a body positioned within the aperture, the body constructed of a hard material and supported within the aperture so as to be spaced from the sidewall of the aperture; an elastomeric grip body disposed within the aperture and enveloping the body; and wherein the body is visible through the elastomeric grip body.

In yet another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle having a longitudinal axis, a first surface and a second surface opposite the first surface; a head connected to the handle; an aperture forming a passageway through the handle from the first surface to the second surface; and an elastomeric grip body disposed within the aperture and enveloping a solid body.

In still another aspect, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle; a head connected to the handle; an aperture in the handle; and a grip body disposed within the aperture and enveloping a body, the grip body constructed of a first material and the body constructed of a second material, the second material being harder than the first material.

In a further aspect, the invention can be any ansate implement comprising any one of the inventive handles described above.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to multi-component toothbrushes having enhanced visual and/or scenting effects resulting from the properties (e.g., transparency) and structural configuration (e.g., use of a base component having projections) of the toothbrush components.

Toothbrushes are often constructed from multiple components having dissimilar properties in terms of hardness, texture, color, etc. to provide an overall product possessing a number of desired features, such as ease of gripping, good bending/flexibility characteristics, and high durability. However, the domain of possible combinations of components which can be combined using straightforward manufacturing techniques is limited by component compatibility, which in turn depends upon the individual component compositions. Thus, while the incorporation of aesthetic features (e.g., three-dimensional effects) and even scenting agents in toothbrushes may be desired to improve product appeal to the user, the components required to obtain these properties often cannot be easily combined in an efficient and/or low-cost manner. For example, combining transparent and opaque plastics can require the use of chemical adhesives or bonding agents for acceptable adherence of these components.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Aspects of the invention relate to toothbrushes constructed of at least two components such as injection molded plastics having distinct optical properties (e.g., transparency). In representative embodiments, the components are chemically compatible such that they can be acceptably adhered to one other without an adhesive.

The components combine to provide visual effects such as the appearance of three-dimensional features (e.g., projections) in a base component at varying depths beneath an overlying (or covering) transparent or partially transparent second component. For example, if the second component is only partially transparent, then its use to cover projection surfaces of a base component at varying thicknesses will result in varying degrees of visibility of these surfaces. Projection surfaces covered by a relatively thick layer of partially transparent plastic component may be only faintly visible compared to projection surfaces covered by a relatively thin layer (or otherwise not covered at all, i.e., protruding through the partially transparent plastic component). If desired, underlying surfaces of the base component may be essentially completely obscured, causing the projection surfaces to appear suspended in the partially transparent second component.

In some embodiments, the second components or other toothbrush components may contain scenting agents. In any event, it will be appreciated from the present disclosure how varying component thicknesses and scenting concentrations can be used to vary and control the release of scenting agent from different portions of the toothbrush surface exterior (e.g., portions of the handle).

Aspects of the invention therefore relate to a toothbrush comprising a base component comprising an outer surface, a gripping region and an oral engaging region; a second component covering at least a portion of said base component in said gripping region, wherein said base component comprises a plurality of cutouts and at least one projection in said gripping region, wherein said first component is opaque and said second component is at least partially transparent, wherein said at least one projection is oval in shape and protrudes through said second component so that a surface of said at least one projection is substantially flush with said outer surface of said base component.

Further aspects of the invention relate to a toothbrush, as discussed above, comprising a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region and a second component covering a portion of the base component in the gripping region. The base component and the second component are chemically compatible, such that the components can adhere to a satisfactory degree without the use of a chemical adhesive, bonding agent, or even mechanical interlocking of the components.

In another aspect, the invention may be a toothbrush comprising: a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region, wherein said base component comprises a first scenting agent; and a second component covering at least a portion of said base component in said gripping region, to control a rate of release of said first scenting agent from said base component in said gripping region.

In yet another aspect, the invention may be a toothbrush comprising: a base component having a gripping region and an oral engaging region; a scented component comprising a first scenting agent, said scented component covering at least a portion of said base component in said gripping region; and a second component covering at least a portion of said scented component to control a rate of release of said first scenting agent from said scented component.

The present application is a U.S. national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent Application No. PCT/US2011/66045, filed Dec. 20, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

There is a need for safe, effective antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents for use in oral care compositions. Magnolia extract is known to contain compounds having antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory properties, and such compounds have been the focus of considerable interest for use in oral care compositions. The use of such compounds in oral care compositions is described, for example, in WO2001/085116, WO 2011/106492 and WO 2011/106493, the contents of which application are incorporated herein by reference. Methods of synthesizing magnolol (5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol) are disclosed, e.g. in WO 2011/106003. Synthetic non-natural analogs of various components of magnolia extract having other alkyls in place of allyl are also known to have antibacterial activity, but the compounds are in some cases expensive or difficult to synthesize.

Existing synthetic methods for magnolol involve costly reagents and yields are low. There is a need for cheaper, higher yield synthetic procedures to make magnolol and related compounds.

SUMMARY

Previous synthetic approaches to making magnolol generally start with bromination of biphenyl-2,2′-diol, to get the 5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl-2,2′-diol, followed by O-protection, with methyl or other O-protecting group, reaction with allyl bromide to get the magnolol in protected form, and deprotection to obtain magnolol (5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol, sometimes named as 4,4′-diallyl-2,2′biphenol). We have found that on scale up, the step of O-protecting the 5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl-2,2′-diol is inefficient and slow. We have found that carrying out the O-protection step before the bromination step results in a more efficient reaction and higher yields.

The deprotection step is another expensive and yield limiting step in the existing processes. The methods reported for demethylation are often costly, and require sometimes very low temperatures (−78° C. using BBr3) and sometimes reflux conditions. The reaction mixture is always difficult to separate and purify which results in low yield of magnolol. We have found that the use of an aluminium chloride/thiourea complex for deprotection does not require extreme temperatures or expensive reagents and results in high yields.

Some embodiments of the present invention provide a simple, relatively high yield synthesis for magnolol (5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol), comprising(i) methylating biphenyl-2,2′-diol using dimethyl sulfate, to obtain 2,2′-dimethoxy-biphenyl;(ii) brominating the 2,2′-dimethoxy-biphenyl to obtain 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl;(iii) alkylating the 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl with allyl bromide to obtain 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl;(iv) demethylating the 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl by reaction with aluminium chloride and thiourea; and(v) recovering the 5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol thus obtained.

In some embodiments, the present invention further provides a method for production of tetrahydromagnolol (5,5′-dipropyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol), comprising hydrogenating the 5,5′-diallyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol product of the foregoing method, e.g., in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to devices and methods for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as an indicator of pregnancy. More particularly, the devices can provide improved analytical and clinical sensitivity by detecting all clinically relevant hCG isoforms.

BACKGROUND

Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a glycoprotein hormone produced during pregnancy. The hCG hormone is produced by the developing embryo soon after fertilization and later by syncytiotrophoblast cells in the developing placenta, and its primary function is to maintain the production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy. The hCG hormone is a member of the glycoprotein hormone family (GPH) that also includes luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). All members of the GPH family are heterodimers that consist of an alpha and beta subunit. The alpha subunit is conserved across the GPHs, while the beta subunit of hCG is unique, although there remains about 80% homology across the beta subunits within the GPH family. In addition to conferring differentiation, the beta subunit also grants each heterodimer its unique biological activity and receptor specificity.

Intact hCG, which is also known as regular hCG, has a molecular weight of around 37 kDa and is composed of 244 amino acids. The alpha subunit contains 92 amino acids and the beta subunit contains 145 amino acids. Intact hCG is generally present at varying levels throughout pregnancy, has been noted to be the predominant form of hCG in later stages of pregnancy, and has previously been believed to have the most biological relevance throughout all stages of pregnancy. Multiple variants of hCG that exhibit independent functions are currently recognized and one of these is hyperglycosylated hCG (hCG-H) which is predominantly produced in early pregnancy. A variety of dissociation and degradation products of hCG are found in blood and urine and these include, among others, nicked hyperglycosylated hCG, nicked hCG, free hCG beta subunit (hCG-β), nicked free hCG beta subunit, nicked hyperglycosylated hCG free beta subunit, and hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf). See de Medeiros et al.,Human Reproduction Update15(1): 69-95 (2009) and Birken et al.,Endocrinology123: 572-583 (1988), which are incorporated herein by reference.

In early pregnancy urine, the levels of hCG and its dissociation and degradation products, collectively referred to as hCG isoforms or variants, vary greatly from day to day and from subject to subject. Most pregnancy tests have been developed to preferentially detect intact hCG or to detect some combination of hCG, hCG-H, and hCG-β.

One distinct degradation product of hCG is the hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf), which is a fragment of hCG-β, has a molecular weight of about 14 kDa, and contains 73 amino acids in its protein core. The hCG-βcf isoform is now recognized to be a predominant form of hCG present in urine from about seven weeks of pregnancy. See de Medeiros et al.,Obstet. Gynecol,80(2): 223-230 (1992), which is incorporated herein by reference. It has been noted that high levels of hCG-βcf can cause false negative results in urine-based pregnancy tests. For more information, see Diwan,Med. Lab. Observerpg. 18-20 (February 2011); Cervinski et al.,Clin. Chem. Lab. Med.48(7): 935-942 (2010); Gronowski et al.,Clin. Chem.55(7): 1389-1394 (2009), which are incorporated herein by reference. Previous and current pregnancy tests, however, do not detect this isoform or have only limited detection capability for this isoform in urine samples.

Accurate and rapid detection of low levels of various hCG isoforms is desirable to confirm pregnancy early after conception has occurred. Further, it is desirable to minimize incidences of false negative results. Accordingly, it would be beneficial to develop a pregnancy test to detect multiple relevant forms of hCG (e.g., all clinically relevant forms of hCG) to increase the reliability and accuracy of pregnancy detection, particularly in early pregnancy.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides systems and methods for identifying the presence in liquid samples of pregnancy indicators, and can be particularly useful for pregnancy detection. In particular, the invention provides systems and methods that allow for the detection of all clinically relevant isoforms of hCG that may be present in a liquid sample. For example, the invention may provide devices that are capable of detecting hCG-βcf in addition to one or more other hCG isoforms. Such systems and methods may provide enhanced sensitivity (e.g., increased provision of positive results early in pregnancy when levels of hCG present in the urine of a subject are low and often previously inconclusive). Such systems and methods may provide enhanced clinical sensitivity (e.g., a lower likelihood of false negative pregnancy test results), which can be evidenced by enhanced analytical sensitivity.

In certain aspects, the invention provides a device for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample, wherein the device comprises a substrate comprising: i) a first antibody that recognizes all clinically relevant hCG isoforms; ii) a second antibody that is specific for an epitope unique to the hCG beta core fragment (hCG-βcf) isoform or that is specific for an epitope common to both hCG-βcf and hCG beta subunit (hCG-β); and iii) a third antibody that binds multiple hCG isoforms but not the hCG-βcf isoform. In specific embodiments, one of the following conditions can be met: a) the first antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label; or b) both of the second antibody and the third antibody can be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. In certain embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the substrate comprises a release medium formed of a first material and a capture medium formed of a second, different material.

In some embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the second and third antibodies are immobilized at one or more capture sites located on the capture medium. The second and third antibodies, for example, can be mixed, and the mixture of antibodies can be immobilized at the capture site. In such embodiments, the first antibody can be deposited on the release medium. The first antibody can, in certain embodiments, be conjugated with a detectable label.

In some embodiments, a device is provided, wherein the first antibody is immobilized at a capture site located on the capture medium. In such embodiments, the second and third antibodies can be, for example, deposited on the release medium. The second and third antibodies can be deposited on separate regions of the release medium or can be mixed, and the mixture of antibodies can be deposited on the release medium. In certain embodiments, the second and third antibodies may be conjugated with one or more detectable labels.

In certain embodiments, a device is provided wherein the capture medium includes a capture component immobilized at a capture site, the capture component comprising avidin or an equivalent thereof. In such devices, the first antibody, second antibody, and third antibody may be deposited on the release medium. For example, the first antibody, the second antibody, and third antibody can be deposited on separate regions on the release medium or in some embodiments, the first antibody is deposited on a first region on the release medium, and the second and third antibodies are mixed and the mixture of antibodies is deposited on a second, separate region on the release medium. In devices utilizing a capture component comprising avidin, one or more of the antibodies preferably can be conjugated with biotin (i.e., biotinylated). Further, one or more of the antibodies preferably can be conjugated with a detectable label.

For example, in some embodiments, the second and third antibodies are both biotinylated. In such embodiments, the first antibody may optionally be conjugated with a detectable label. In other embodiments, the first antibody is biotinylated and both of the second and third antibodies may optionally be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. The form of the avidin can vary; for example, the avidin can comprise monomeric or polymeric avidin. In certain embodiments, the avidin can comprise streptavidin.

In certain embodiments, one, two, or three of the first antibody, the second antibody, and the third antibody are monoclonal antibodies. In preferred embodiments, all of the first, second, and third antibodies are monoclonal antibodies. The detectable label or labels, where present, can vary. In some embodiments, the detectable label comprises a colored particle. For example, in certain embodiments, the colored particle is a colloidal gold particle (i.e., a gold sol). The first, second, and third antibodies and their specificities for certain hCG isoforms can vary. For example, in certain embodiments of the invention, the second antibody is specific for an epitope unique to hCG-βcf or specific to an epitope that is common to both hCG-βcf and hCG-β.

In another aspect of the present invention is provided a method for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample. In certain embodiments, the method comprises applying a liquid sample to a device for detecting human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) isoforms in a liquid sample. The device can be a device as described above, which comprises a substrate comprising: i) a first antibody that recognizes all clinically relevant hCG isoforms; ii) a second antibody that is specific for an epitope unique to hCG-βcf or that is specific for an epitope common to both hCG-βcf and hCG-β; and iii) a third antibody that binds multiple hCG isoforms but not the hCG-βcf isoform. As above, the first antibody can be conjugated with a detectable label, or both of the second antibody and the third antibody can be conjugated with one or more detectable labels. Applying the liquid sample is generally done such that any hCG isoform in the liquid sample flows with the liquid across the substrate so as to contact the antibodies so as to form a sandwich complex comprising relevant hCG isoforms. After applying the liquid sample, the method may further comprise determining the presence of one or more of the hCG isoforms in the liquid sample by inspection of a capture site on the substrate, wherein the presence of the hCG isoforms is indicated by the presence of a detectable signal (e.g., at the capture site) caused by the presence of the sandwich complexes at the capture site. For example, the detectable signal can comprise color development (or other visually identifiable means) such as may provide a visual signal. Further, the detectable signal may be a signal that is electronically analyzed so as to provide a digital output, giving the user the results in a digital form.

In a further aspect of the present invention is provided a method for increasing clinical sensitivity by detecting the presence of multiple pregnancy indicators in a liquid sample. For example, such method can comprise applying a liquid sample to a device as described above, such that various hCG isoforms in the liquid sample flow with the liquid across the substrate so as to contact the antibodies and form sandwich complexes comprising relevant hCG isoforms. The method further can comprise determining the presence of one or more of the hCG isoforms in the liquid sample by inspection of a capture site on the substrate, wherein the presence of the hCG is indicated by a detectable signal resulting from the presence of the sandwich complexes at the capture site. The device beneficially can provide enhanced clinical sensitivity for detecting a pregnancy as compared to devices that do not include the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform. The clinical sensitivity for detecting a pregnancy can vary, and in certain embodiments, the clinical sensitivity can be significantly better than the clinical sensitivity of devices that do not include the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform. In certain embodiments, the clinical sensitivity of the device incorporating the antibody specific for hCG-βcf can exceed the clinical sensitivity of a similar device that does not include the antibody that is specific for hCG-βcf when measured 6 days, 5 days, or 4 days before the expected menstrual period. For example, the clinical sensitivity of the device may be about 5% or greater, about 10% or greater, or about 15% or greater on these days. In certain embodiments, the device may be about 5% or greater on days 6, 5, and 4 before the expected menstrual period when compared to similar device without the antibody for hCG-βcf isoform. For example, in one specific embodiment, the clinical sensitivity of the device incorporating the antibody specific for hCG-fβcf is around 14%, around 20%, and around 10% greater on days 6, 5 and 4, respectively, before the expected menstrual period when compared to similar device without the antibody that is specific for the hCG-βcf isoform.

The present invention relates to a cleaning composition that is thickened with xanthan gum and preserved with carbonate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Cleaning compositions can be designed to clean different surfaces. Because cleaning compositions typically contain surfactants, they need to be preserved from microbiological growth. Typically, an additional preservative is needed, and an additional cost is added to the composition. It would be desirable to have a material that is already present in the cleaning composition provide the microbiological protection. Also, cleaners may need to be thickened for their intended purpose for which a thickener can be added. Also, it may be desired to have a cleaner that is clear. When designing a cleaner to meet all of these needs, it may not be possible to obtain a clear composition that is thickened and self preserved. It would be desirable to develop this type of cleaning composition.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Provided is an aqueous cleaning composition comprising at least one surfactant, xanthan gum, and a carbonate salt, wherein the composition has a turbidity of less than 16 NTU. Also provided is a method of cleaning a substrate by applying the cleaning composition to the substrate.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Human periodontal diseases are inflammatory disorders that are the result of complex interactions between periodontopathogens and the host's immune system response. It is believed that there are two interrelated aspects to the progression of periodontal disease; the first is the activation of the immune system of the host and the second is the production of oxygen radicals and their related metabolites. Increased production of oxygen radicals may contribute to oxidative stress, which is believed to be involved in periodontal disease.

Gingivitis is the inflammation or infection of the gums and the alveolar bones that support the teeth. Gingivitis is generally believed to be caused by bacteria in the mouth (particularly the bacteria associated with plaque formation) and the inflammatory response triggered by the presence of bacteria and the toxins formed as by-products from the bacteria. Periodontitis is a progressively worsened state of disease as compared to gingivitis, where inflamed gums begin to recede from the teeth, thus forming pockets there between, which can ultimately result in destruction of the bone and periodontal ligament. Chronic infection and inflammation potentially results in the subsequent loss of teeth.

It is generally believed that the cellular components implicated by these diseases and conditions include epithelial tissue, gingival fibroblasts, and circulating leukocytes, all of which contribute to the host response to pathogenic factors generated by the bacteria. Although the bacterial infection is often the etiological event in many of these oral diseases, the pathogenesis of the disease is mediated by the host response.

Bacterial infection of the oral tissue increases the host's immune system response and diminishes the healing process by up-regulating inflammatory mediators that can induce significant tissue damage surrounding the foci of infection.

There is a need for oral care compositions that effectively reduce the development or progression of oral disease, preferably by having an active ingredient that diminishes the effects of oral disease by preventing or reducing multiple etiological factors that contribute to and/or exacerbate oral disease. Further, there is a need to stabilize oral care actives in an oral composition, so that their functionality and bioavailability as delivered to a subject in vivo is preserved and stabilized.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to an oral composition comprising:a propolis extract;an oral care active compound chosen from: a cationic antibacterial agent, an anti-attachment agent, a biofilm disruption agent or an anti-inflammatory agent; anda source of fluoride ions.

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to a method of making an oral composition comprising:admixing one or more carrier ingredients to form a homogenous mixture;adding a fluoride ion source to the mixture;adding at least one of: a cationic antibacterial agent, an anti-attachment agent, a biofilm disruption agent or an anti-inflammatory agent; andadding a propolis extract to the homogeneous mixture at temperatures of less than or equal to about 40° C. to form the oral composition.

In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods of preventing bacterial from forming a biofilm, suppressing an immune system recognition of an antigen on an oral surface of a mammal, reducing an immune system response, and suppressing production of one or more mediators of inflammation on an oral surface, comprising administering and applying the compositions herein to the oral surface. In certain embodiments, the present invention is directed to methods of maintaining or increasing systemic health of a mammal comprising applying a composition according to claim to the oral surfaces at least once a day a period of time.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The antibacterial effects of zinc ions in the oral cavity are described in the art and numerous attempts have been made to prepare dentifrice compositions incorporating zinc ions to take advantage of the therapeutic benefits of reduced plaque, gum inflammation and/or gingivitis. However, such formulations are noted for their unpleasant taste, often referred to as “astringent”. Such unpleasant organoleptic experiences often result in reduced compliance to an oral care regimen by the patient/consumer.

Various attempts to disguise or avoid the unpleasant organoleptic aspects while retaining and/or enhancing the therapeutic benefits obtained have been made. However, there remains a need in the art for a dentifrice formulation that allows the patient/consumer to obtain the therapeutic benefits of a zinc-containing dentifrice, whilst not suffering the disadvantageous organoleptic experience associated with such dentifrices.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention includes a dentifrice composition that comprises a zinc ion source, a polyphosphate ion source, an anethole, and a silica. The silica has a mean particle size of about 5 to about 12 microns, an Einlehner hardness of about 1 to about 20, and an oil absorption of about 40 to less than about 100 cc/100 g. The composition contains zinc ions and polyphosphate ions in a weight ratio of about 0.1:1 to about 10:1 and has a RDA value of about 100 to about 200 and a PCR value of about 75 to about 110. In one embodiment, the zinc ion source is zinc citrate.

The invention also includes related methods, such as a method of maintaining and/or enhancing systemic health that includes topically applying the dentifrice composition of the invention at least once a day to an oral surface, or a method of reducing the presence of plaque on an oral surface comprising topically applying an oral care composition at least once a day to an oral surface.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to an absorbent composition and its method of production and use. Particularly, the present invention relates to an absorbent composition comprising a liquid absorbing material, at least one alkaline earth metal peroxide and an acidic material, wherein the composition is found surprisingly effective in mitigating fecal odor.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Before the advent of litters, pet owners had relegated pets to outside the home for lack of an area for taking care of pet excrement. Litters allow pets to take care of waste functions and live inside the home. Housebroken animals, such as cats, are trained into the habit of urinating and defecating in a specially provided litter box. Similarly, untrained and caged animals, such as guinea pigs, urinate and defecate on the floor of their cage, often in approximately the same floor area of the cage. Consequently, pet owners, homeowners, veterinarians and laboratory personnel have added liquid absorbing materials to the litter box or cage to collect the urine and feces.

The most commonly used litter box liquid absorbing materials are inexpensive clays, such as calcined clays, that are safe and non-irritating to the animals, and that absorb substantial amounts of liquids. Other porous, solid litter box absorbent materials, that are used alone or in combination, include straw, sawdust, wood chips, wood shavings, porous polymeric beads, shredded paper, sand, bark, cloth, ground corn husks, and cellulose. Each of these absorbent materials has the advantage of low cost. The entire contents of the litter box including the soiled and unsoiled liquid absorbing materials will eventually be removed, because of the offensive odor caused by the absorbed urine and feces.

Many litters adequately control the odor associated with urine. This is typically done through simple absorption of liquid, which counteracts the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Currently clay soils or comminuted rocks, e.g. the sodium bentonites, are used to improve litter compositions. Sodium bentonites not only absorb liquid waste such as urine, but they also absorb the odor associated with the liquid waste, as the material binds amine compounds in the ‘face sites” of the clay interlayers.

However, clay litters composed of sodium bentonites or other materials do not address the issue of fecal odor. Fecal odor differs from urine odor in that the odor is produced immediately at the time of the defecation, whereas urine odor, being produced by the action of microbes, evolves in the days following urination. Materials in fecal odor that carry an especially strong impact include butyric acid, p-cresol, skatole, and dimethyltrisulfide.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART

A variety of methods and compositions have been described in the prior art for preparing animal litter to combat offensive odor. One such example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,405,354 to Thomas II, et al., describing a method for controlling ammonia odor from organic waste by monobasic salts of dibasic acids, and mono-, di- or tri-basic acids, such that the acid has a dissociation constant pKaless than the corresponding dissociation constant of aqueous ammonia.

Another example is WO2000/53001 to Simmler-Hübenthal et al., disclosing an animal litter containing thyme camphor and/or at least one solid peroxo compound to reduce smells.

Another example is U.S. Application No. 2006/0088498 to Martin et al., describing a solvent activated antimicrobial oxidizing agent comprising a reactor such as magnesium peroxide and/or calcium peroxide within a reactor core for treating animal litter, and that such oxidizing agent may be used to eliminate odor related to microbes on ice in ice machines. However the composition of Martin et al. requires a reactor wall such as a porous membrane to control the release of solvent to the reactants and the diffusion of the oxidizing agent.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

An absorbent composition comprising a liquid absorbing material, and a combination of at least one alkaline earth metal peroxide and an acidic material selected from citric acid, zinc chloride and malic acid, has been found surprisingly effective in mitigating fecal odor. The liquid absorbing material is a clumping or non-clumping material known in the art.

This application is directed to agglomerates for forming flavored beverages. More particularly, the present invention is directed to cocoa and sugar based agglomerates for use in creating cold liquid beverages and methods for forming the agglomerates.

BACKGROUND

Many popular consumer beverages are formed by adding a flavored mix to a liquid. The flavored mix is provided in various forms including syrups, powders, and the like. One common consumer beverage category includes chocolate-flavored drinks such as chocolate-flavored milk and hot chocolate.

Production of chocolate-flavored drinks often includes mixing syrup or powder into a liquid. Powdered mixes are typically formed by dry blending powder ingredients, or by spray drying, freeze drying, or a rewet agglomeration process followed by grinding into fine agglomerates or powders. The fine agglomerates or powders used in known mixtures have small particle size. While they can provide good dispersibility/solubility in warm liquids, these small particles have slow dispersibility and/or low solubility in cold liquids. For this reason, syrup is commonly added to make a chocolate-flavored beverage when starting with a cold liquid, even though powdered mixtures are commonly added to a hot liquid.

The small particles of powder mixtures can float, which in combination with general decreased solubility of materials in cold liquids, compounds the difficulty of using powders in those situations. Additionally, the small particles can form a dust which can be messy and increases difficulty in handling and using powder mixtures. The problem of slow dispersibility or low solubility in cold liquids for making chocolate-flavored beverages is further exacerbated by the presence of cocoa powder to provide a chocolate flavor. Cocoa powder is difficult to wet and/or rehydrate in cold liquids.

These and other drawbacks are associated with current materials used for forming flavored cold cocoa or chocolate beverages.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to a cold liquid cocoa and sugar based agglomerate and methods of forming such agglomerates that readily disintegrate in a cold liquid, such as milk.

According to exemplary embodiments, a method of forming cocoa and sugar based agglomerates comprises mixing cocoa powder, sugar and an aqueous ethanol solution to form a dough and drying the dough to form a porous dried dough piece having less than 0.5% by weight residual ethanol.

Exemplary embodiments are further directed to a process of making agglomerates of 2 mm in size or larger, often 5 mm in size or larger, that submerse and disintegrate instantly into cold aqueous liquids, such as cold water or cold milk. The agglomerates are composed of cocoa powder and a sweetener such as sugars, and typically include other dry ingredients such as milk powders, fibers, corn syrup solids, and flavoring agents. The agglomerates have a porous structure in which the dry powders are lightly bridged by a thin layer of sugar coating. The porous structure is formed by vacuum removal of a solvent that is used to wet and agglomerate dry powder ingredients into pieces.

The pieces formed can be large chunks of 50 mm or greater in size. The chunks can be further reduced into smaller particles or pieces of 2 mm or larger or a sheet of dough can be cut into the desired piece size. The solvent is aqueous ethanol, which controls the solubility of sugar as a binder in forming the agglomerates or large pieces.

In one embodiment, a method of forming cold liquid dispersible/soluble cocoa and sugar based agglomerates includes preparing an aqueous ethanol solution that contains at least 50% by weight ethanol, more preferably about 80% by weight ethanol. The aqueous ethanol solution is added to a pre-blend of dry powders of finely granulated sweeteners, such as 6× sugar, and cocoa powder. The amount of aqueous ethanol solution added to the powder blend is the minimum amount needed to form agglomerates or wet dough, at least 10% (wt/wt) or above, typically about 20% (wt/wt) or above, even preferably about 25% (wt/wt) or above, up to about 40% (wt/wt). The mixture is mixed in a mixer, like a Hobart mixer, to form small agglomerates or a wet dough.

The aqueous ethanol solvent can be removed using a high vacuum drier, e.g. 99% or above vacuum (7600 MmTorr) at a temperature below or above the solvent freezing point and results in a porous structure that can readily submerse, disperse, and dissolve in cold as well as hot aqueous liquid. The relatively larger particle size of 2 mm or greater of the porous particles or pieces can submerse into liquid faster by its own weight, and a thin bridge of sugar coating between dry powder granules dissolves fast and make the whole pieces or chunks disintegrate in both cold or hot liquids almost instantly.

Among the advantages of exemplary embodiments is that methods described herein produce porous cocoa-sugar based agglomerates that disintegrate quickly and thoroughly in cold liquids.

Another advantage is that the methods in accordance with exemplary embodiments provide control over porosity of the agglomerates, which in turn provides control over the dispersibility/solubility of the agglomerates.

Still another advantage is that the methods provides control of binder solubility therefore control of thin bridge between granules, which in turn provides control of dispersibility/solubility of the agglomerates or pieces.

Also another advantage is that the methods produce agglomerates or pieces or chunks in large size, which includes a reduction in the difficulty associated with handling fine powders associated with current powdered beverage mixtures and also helps with portion control.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments that illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.

This application is directed to comestibles and more particularly to rapidly dissolving comestible solids.

BACKGROUND

Mints and chewing gum are commonly used by consumers to freshen breath after meals, before personal interactions, and in other social situations. While these products are generally effective, there are many situations in which a consumer desires fresh breath but doesn't have time for a traditional tablet mint to dissolve or to chew gum long enough to achieve the desired level of freshness.

Mouthwash is a quick and effective way to freshen one's breath, but is generally not a suitable alternative in most cases for a variety of reasons. Another manner of providing a quicker way in which to achieve freshness has been the use of products generally known as breath strips, which are dissolvable films containing breath freshening ingredients. Breath strips have their own attendant drawbacks, including a propensity to stick to the roof of one's mouth and a mouthfeel that some consumers find unpleasant. Breath strips can sometimes also start to become sticky and/or dissolve on contact with the skin when removed from their container, particularly in humid weather.

These and other drawbacks are found in current breath fresheners and other products.

SUMMARY

What is needed is a comestible product that provides a tactile shape and mouthfeel consistent with a traditional tablet mint but that has a rapid dissolution that is more characteristic of a breath strip, to which exemplary embodiments are directed.

According to an exemplary embodiment, a rapidly dissolving comestible solid comprises a fondant of a super saturated solution of a bulk sweetener, a texturizing agent and, optionally, a hydrocolloid, wherein the fondant has a crystalline structure that does not exhibit cold flow at room temperature.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Dental plaque or plaque biofilm is a soft deposit that forms on surfaces of the oral cavity, such as tissue and teeth, and is comprised of an accumulation of bacteria and salivary as well as food by-products. Plaque adheres tenaciously at the points of irregularity or discontinuity (e.g., to calculus, at the gum line, on tongue surface and within crevices, and the like). Besides being unsightly, plaque is implicated in the occurrence of gingivitis and other forms of periodontal disease.

For the most part, the bacteria in the oral cavity are a part of a protective biofilm that essentially renders them resistant to most treatments. Few people clean their tongue after brushing, even though it's been shown that as much as 50 percent of the mouth's bacteria can be found here. Additionally, for many people, brushing or scraping the tongue is difficult because of the gag reflex. Therefore, cleaning the tongue non-mechanically is highly desirable for those who are unable to do so with a mechanical device.

A wide variety of agents have been suggested in the art to retard plaque formation and the oral infections and dental disease associated with plaque formation.

In spite of the extensive prior art relating to antibacterial dentifrice and oral compositions, there is still a need in the art to formulate a product capable of enhanced effect in the retardation of bacterial plaque accumulation.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention encompasses an oral composition containing an anti-adhesion agent, preferably a cysteine protease and most preferably ficin. In another aspect, the cysteine protease is in combination with one or more ingredients, such as antibacterial agent and surfactant. The anti-adhesion agent mitigates interaction between an oral cavity surface and plaque-forming materials, such as bacteria.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and, in particular to a toothbrush with a powered head having fixed and movable tuft blocks.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of toothbrush configurations exist that have stationary and/or mechanically-driven movable cleaning elements. These conventional toothbrushes are dedicated to tooth cleaning/polishing operations and typically include a head portion directed to the cleaning polishing operations, and a handle portion. The head typically has a flat or slightly altered surface to which tooth cleaning elements are attached, or to which mechanically-driven movable carriers for the tooth cleaning elements are attached.

Conventional toothbrushes have tooth cleaning elements that extend from a rigid head. Teeth and gums by nature have a complex intricate contour. Due to the rigid nature of the attachment of the tooth cleaning elements to the head of the toothbrush, the orientation of the tooth cleaning elements is not flexible and thus conventional toothbrushes do not provide optimal cleaning of teeth and gums. Conventional toothbrushes therefore have great difficulty in contacting areas of the teeth located at a greater distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between teeth.

It would be desirable to provide a powered toothbrush that reduces or overcomes some or all of the difficulties inherent in prior known devices. Particular objects and advantages will be apparent to those skilled in the art, that is, those who are knowledgeable or experienced in this field of technology, in view of the following disclosure of the invention and detailed description of certain embodiments.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The principles of the invention may be used to provide a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In accordance with a first aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. At least one fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to each fixed tuft block and has a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending outwardly away from the first surface. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block with respect to each fixed tuft block

In accordance with another aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to the head in a fixed orientation and is spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first fixed tuft block and the second fixed tuft block by an elastomeric member. A drive assembly is operably connected to the movable tuft block to move the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner with respect to the first and second fixed tuft blocks.

In accordance with a further aspect, a powered toothbrush includes a handle having, a neck. A head is mounted to the neck and has a first surface and an opposed second surface. A first fixed tuft block is mounted to a distal end of the head in a fixed orientation. A second fixed tuft block is mounted to a proximate end of the head in a fixed orientation and spaced from the first tuft block. A movable tuft block is flexibly connected to the first tuft block and the second tuft block by an elastomeric membrane and has a base portion including a slot. A battery is mounted inside the handle, and a motor is operably connected to the battery. A drive shaft is rotatably driven by the motor and has an offset portion that engages the slot in the movable tuft block to drive the movable tuft block in an oscillating manner.

Substantial advantage is achieved by providing a powered toothbrush with at least one fixed tuft block, and at least one movable tuft block driven by a drive assembly. In particular, certain embodiments improve cleaning of teeth and gums, and provide improved access to and contact with areas of the teeth located at a distance from the head, including interproximal spaces between the teeth.

These and additional features and advantages disclosed here will be further understood from the following detailed disclosure of certain embodiments.

"BACKGROUND

Arginine bicarbonate has use in various industrial applications, including use in personal care compositions, such as oral care compositions. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,558 describes the use of arginine bicarbonate and calcium carbonate for preventing or treating dental hypersensitivity. As the industrial requirements for arginine bicarbonate increase, so will the need for improved processes and methods for its manufacture.

PCT published application WO2009/100267 describes methods of production of arginine bicarbonate.

Arginine bicarbonate may be produced by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through a saturated arginine aqueous solution at room temperature and pressure. U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,851 describes preparing arginine bicarbonate from arginine hydroxide by bubbling carbon dioxide or by adding dry ice in excess into a solution of arginine free base. However, the efficiency of the existing process needs to be improved. The existing process is slow, requiring 24 to 48 hours to complete the reaction. Carbon dioxide has very limited solubility in water, and releasing the gas into the solution produces a maximum concentration of 1.2×10−5M at room temperature and its natural partial pressure (3.5×10−4atmosphere). The solubility of arginine in water is only 15% weight/weight at room temperature. Producing a concentrated arginine bicarbonate solution (e.g., 40%) requires the continual addition of arginine to the solution, thereby increasing production time and requiring constant monitoring of the reaction. Thus, there is a need to improve methods to manufacture arginine bicarbonate.

SUMMARY

Methods for manufacturing arginine bicarbonate. The methods represent a significant improvement over existing techniques, as concentrated solutions of about 50%, and in certain embodiments 70% w/w of arginine and bicarbonate anions may be produced in as little as about 90 to about 120 minutes (vs. about 24-48 hours to produce far lower concentrations of arginine bicarbonate using the prior art methods), followed by faster and easier recovery processes of arginine bicarbonate salt from the solution.

In one embodiment, a method of producing arginine bicarbonate including contacting carbon dioxide gas having a pressure of from 6895 Pa (1 psi) to 68947 Pa (10 psi) with a starting slurry containing arginine at a temperature of 60° C. to 80° C., to form a slurry or solution including arginine and bicarbonate anion, contacting the solution or slurry with carbon dioxide until the about slurry or solution has a concentration of arginine bicarbonate above 50% and a pH below 9, and recovering arginine bicarbonate from the solution.

In another embodiment, a process for producing arginine bicarbonate is disclosed that includes contacting an arginine water slurry in a ratio of arginine to water of 60:40 with carbon dioxide having a pressure of from 6895 Pa (1 psi) to 68947 Pa (10 psi), heating the arginine slurry to a temperature of from 60 C to 80 C for the duration of the reaction until a slurry or solution containing at least 50% arginine bicarbonate having a pH of less than 9 is formed, cooling the resulting slurry or solution to 25 C, to form a solution of arginine bicarbonate having a concentration of arginine bicarbonate of about 50% by weight.

This application is a U.S. national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent Application No. PCT/CN2010/002108, filed Dec. 21, 2010, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to oral care implements, and specifically to oral care implements having a flexible head formed by a plurality of segments and/or a specially designed elastomeric cleaning element.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. Conventional toothbrushes having a flat bristle trim are limited in their ability to conform to the curvature of the teeth, to penetrate into the interproximal areas between the teeth, to sweep away the plaque and debris, and to clean along the gum line. Additionally, such toothbrushes have a limited ability to retain dentifrice for cleaning, the teeth. During the brushing process, the dentifrice typically slips through the tufts of bristles and away from the contact between the bristles and the teeth. As a result, the dentifrice is often spread around the mouth, rather than being concentrated on the contact of the bristles with the teeth. Therefore, the efficiency of the cleaning process is reduced.

While substantial efforts have been made to modify the cleaning elements of toothbrushes to improve the efficiency of the oral cleaning process, the industry continues to pursue arrangements of cleaning elements that will improve upon the existing technology.

A number of attempts have been made to create flexible toothbrush heads that provide greater cleaning efficacy by allowing the head to flex, thereby allowing the bristles and other tooth cleaning elements to extend at various angles relative to one another. In one type of known flexible toothbrush head, the head is broken up into a plurality of segments that are flexible relative to one another and relative to the handle. However, the existing designs of many segmented toothbrush beads result in the head having either too much or not enough flexibility. Too much flexibility results in the head being unable to transmit sufficient pressure to the teeth or other oral surfaces via the bristles when the handle is subject to normal brushing forces. On the other hand, inadequate flexibility results in the segments (and thus the bristles) remaining substantially stationary, thereby defeating the purpose of having a flexible head.

More recently, the strategic arrangement and combination of tooth cleaning elements in the form of elastomeric cleaning elements and bristle tufts has become a more common way of improving cleaning efficiency. However, very little efforts have been made to coordinate the structure and arrangement of elastomeric cleaning elements on flexible toothbrush heads formed by a plurality of segments.

Elastomeric soft tissue cleaners, which are typically located on the rear surface of the toothbrush head, have also become quite popular. However, as with the tooth cleaning elements, very little effort has been expended to coordinate the structure of the soft tissue cleaner with the structure of flexible toothbrush heads utilizing a plurality of segments.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement. Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects. Dental checkups to a dentist office are typically the only feedback a person receives on their dental cleaning efforts. There is unfortunately plenty of time in between checkups for poor dental habits to cause problems. For example, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and a host of other problems can be magnified if dental cleaning habits are not rectified promptly.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement.

In one aspect, the invention may be a toothbrush comprising: a body comprising a handle and a head; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from the head; an oral member coupled to the body, the oral member comprising a water-insoluble porous material and a water-soluble material; a reservoir in the body; and a fluid pathway in the body, the fluid pathway in fluid communication with the water-insoluble porous material and the reservoir.

In another aspect, the invention can be a toothbrush comprising: a handle; a head; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from the head; an oral member comprising a water-soluble material, the oral member located on the head; a reservoir; and a fluid pathway fluidly coupling the oral member and the reservoir.

In a further aspect, the invention can be a toothbrush comprising: a body comprising a handle and a head; a plurality of tooth cleaning elements extending from the head; an oral member coupled to the body, the oral member comprising a porous material and an erodible or dissolvable material; a reservoir in the body; and a fluid pathway in the body, the fluid pathway in fluid communication with the water-insoluble porous material and the reservoir.

In one aspect, an oral care implement includes an oral care region having an oral member having a thickness that is reduced or shortened during use; a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; a receiver fluidly coupled to the oral member for receiving an oral fluid; and a fluid pathway in communication with the receiver to provide the oral fluid to the reservoir. In one possible embodiment, the oral member may be made of a conventional hydrogel material that may swell during use.

In another aspect, an oral care implement includes a reservoir for retaining an oral fluid; and a multilayer collection member including a layer that wears away during use so as to expose an indicium layer that indicates when the reservoir should be provided for analysis of the collected oral fluid.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

The present application is a U.S. national stage application under 35 U.S.C. §371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2011/030139, filed Mar. 28, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to toothbrushes, and more specifically to toothbrushes having oral care fluid delivery.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Toothbrushes are typically used by applying toothpaste to a bristle section followed by brushing regions of the oral cavity, e.g., the teeth, tongue and/or gums. Some toothbrushes have been equipped with fluid reservoirs and systems for delivering auxiliary oral care fluids, such as whitening agents, breath freshening agents and others to a user's oral cavity, in addition to dentifrice. However, in known toothbrushes having fluid delivery capabilities, an applicator containing the oral care fluid is permanently exposed to the external environment. Such oral care implements do not provide adequate sanitary storage between oral care sessions and/or have a tendency to expend the oral care fluid within the reservoir due to excessive evaporation. Thus, a need exists for a toothbrush having an oral care fluid delivery system that protects the applicator from external contaminants in between uses and/or prevents unnecessary loss of the oral care fluid from the reservoir due to excessive evaporation. Furthermore, an additional need exists for a toothbrush having an oral care fluid delivery system that can achieve controlled dosing via capillary action.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Exemplary embodiments of the invention are directed to toothbrushes that have a fluid delivery system. The inventive toothbrush comprises a body having a reservoir containing an oral care fluid therein, the oral care fluid being delivered to an applicator via capillary action. The toothbrush comprises an actuator for moving either the applicator and/or the reservoir between different positions.

In one embodiment, the invention can be a toothbrush having a longitudinal axis comprising: a body comprising a handle, a head coupled to a distal end of the handle, and an internal reservoir containing an oral care fluid; a channel in the body extending from the reservoir to an opening in an outer surface of the body; an applicator comprising a capillary material; an actuator operably coupled to the applicator to move the applicator between: (1) a protracted position in which a portion of the applicator protrudes from the opening; and (2) a retracted position in which the portion of the applicator is retracted into the channel via the opening; and wherein the applicator is in fluid communication with the oral care fluid within the reservoir in both the protracted position and the retracted position so that the oral care fluid is delivered to the applicator via capillary action.

In another embodiment, the invention can be a toothbrush having a longitudinal axis comprising: a body comprising a handle, a head coupled to a distal end of the handle, and an internal reservoir containing an oral care fluid; a channel in the body extending from the reservoir to an opening in an outer surface of the body; an applicator comprising a capillary material; an actuator operably coupled to the applicator to move the applicator between: (1) a protracted position in which a portion of the applicator protrudes from the opening; and (2) a retracted position in which the portion of the applicator is retracted into the channel via the opening; and wherein the applicator is in fluid communication with the oral care fluid within the reservoir in the retracted position so that the oral care fluid is delivered to the applicator via capillary action and removed from fluid communication with the oral care fluid within the reservoir in the protracted position.

In yet another embodiment, the invention can be a toothbrush having a longitudinal axis comprising: a body comprising a handle, a head coupled to a distal end of the handle, and an internal cavity; a reservoir housing disposed within the internal cavity of the body and containing an oral care fluid; an applicator comprising a capillary material affixed to an outer surface of the body; a channel in the body extending from the internal cavity to the applicator; an actuator operably coupled to the reservoir housing for moving the reservoir housing within the internal cavity between: (1) a first position in which the applicator is removed from fluid communication with the oral care fluid within the reservoir housing; and (2) a second position in which the applicator is in fluid communication with the oral care fluid within the reservoir housing so that the oral care fluid is delivered to the applicator via capillary action.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"BACKGROUND

Arginine bicarbonate has use in various industrial applications, including use in personal care compositions, such as oral care compositions. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,524,558 describes the use of arginine bicarbonate and calcium carbonate for preventing or treating dental hypersensitivity. As the industrial requirements for arginine bicarbonate increase, so will the need for improved processes and methods for its manufacture.

PCT published application WO2009/100267, the contents of which are incorporated herein in their entirety as if set forth in full, describes methods of production of arginine bicarbonate.

Arginine bicarbonate may be produced by bubbling carbon dioxide gas through a saturated arginine aqueous solution at room temperature and pressure. U.S. Pat. No. 6,217,851 describes preparing arginine bicarbonate from arginine hydroxide by bubbling carbon dioxide or by adding dry ice in excess into a solution of arginine free base. However, the efficiency of the existing process needs to be improved. The existing process is slow, requiring 24 to 48 hours to complete the reaction. Carbon dioxide has very limited solubility in water, and releasing the gas into the solution produces a maximum concentration of 1.2×10−5M at room temperature and its natural partial pressure (3.5×10−4atmosphere). The solubility of arginine in water is only 15% weight/weight at room temperature. Producing a concentrated arginine bicarbonate solution (e.g., 40%) requires the continual addition of arginine to the solution, thereby increasing production time and requiring constant monitoring of the reaction. Thus, there is a need to improve methods to manufacture arginine bicarbonate.

SUMMARY

Methods for manufacturing arginine bicarbonate. These methods represent a significant improvement over existing techniques, as a highly concentrated solution of arginine and bicarbonate anions in excess of 50%, and in certain embodiments in excess of 75% w/w may be produced in as little as 10 to 20 minutes (vs. 24-48 hours to produce far lower concentrations of arginine bicarbonate using the prior art methods), followed by faster and easier recovery processes of arginine bicarbonate salt from the solution.

In one embodiment, a method of producing arginine bicarbonate including contacting carbon dioxide having a pressure of least 34474 Pa (5 psi) with a starting slurry containing arginine at a temperature of at least 30° C.; adding arginine to the contacted slurry to increase the arginine content to greater than 65% by weight; contacting the increased arginine slurry with carbon dioxide until the slurry has a pH below 9; and recovering arginine bicarbonate from the slurry.

In another embodiment, a process for producing arginine bicarbonate is disclosed that includes contacting an arginine water slurry with carbon dioxide having a pressure greater than 551580 Pa (80 psi); heating the arginine water slurry to a temperature within the range of from 60° C. to 80° C.; adding arginine to the slurry until arginine comprises 65% by weight; contacting carbon dioxide with the increased arginine slurry until the slurry has a pH below 9; cooling the slurry to a temperature of 25° C.

In yet another aspect, a method of producing arginine bicarbonate including subjecting an arginine water slurry to elevated pressure and temperature; contacting the slurry with carbon dioxide to form a slurry comprising arginine and bicarbonate in excess of 65% by weight of arginine; and recovering arginine bicarbonate from the slurry.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed to a manually held and operated toothbrush or to a powered toothbrush which includes a handle and a head.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The head of a conventional toothbrush usually has a flat or slightly altered surface to which cleaning elements are attached. Usually the cleaning elements are strands of plastic material(s) formed into tufts or other groupings. The strand groupings are attached to the head either before or after forming the toothbrush handle.

Various attempts have been made for providing flexibility to the manner in which the bristles are attached. Various approaches have also been taken wherein the bristle carrying surface of the head is not flat. U.S. Pat. No. 1,688,581, for example, discloses a toothbrush having a bristle carrying member which is ordinarily bowed inwardly into the hollow head. The bristle carrying member can be bowed outwardly by manipulating a wire mounted in the toothbrush.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to a toothbrush having an oral care region attached to a handle. The oral care region has a membrane which provides flexible movement of tooth cleaning elements.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes an oral care region with a membrane having attachment of at least one tooth cleaning element. The membrane may be generally curvilinear shaped and resiliently flexible when a brushing force is applied to the tooth cleaning element. In another embodiment, tooth cleaning elements are mounted to the membrane. The tooth cleaning elements may be attached using an anchor free tufting process. In an alternative embodiment, the cleaning elements may be spaced so as to allow separation of a melted proximal portion of the cleaning elements and a portion of the membrane extends downwardly from an underside thereof and between adjacent cleaning elements.

In another embodiment, a toothbrush head includes a portion membrane material depending downwardly and a positioned between the islands of tooth cleaning elements. The portion of membrane material prevents flow of a melted nylon material of the cleaning elements from merging with the melted portion of another cleaning element. The isolation of the molten nylon material enables the cleaning elements to move independently of each other during a brushing operation to enhance oral care.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS

The present application is a U.S. national stage entry under 35 U.S.C. §371 of Patent Cooperation Treaty Patent Application No. PCT/US2011/66053, filed Dec. 20, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND

There is a need for safe, effective antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agents for use in oral care compositions. Magnolia extract is known to contain compounds having antibacterial and/or anti-inflammatory properties, and such compounds have been the focus of considerable interest for use in oral care compositions. The use of such compounds in oral care compositions is described, for example, in WO2001/085116, WO 2011/106492 and WO 2011/106493, the contents of which application are incorporated herein by reference. Methods of synthesizing magnolol are disclosed, e,g, in WO 2011/106003. Synthetic non-natural analogs of various components of magnolia extract are also known to have antibacterial activity, but the compounds are in some cases expensive to synthesize.

Magnolol analogs having lower alkyl in place of allyl are of particular interest, as are compounds wherein the alkyl or allyl side chains are ortho rather than para to the hydoxy goups (isomanolols). Tetrahydro-magnolol, (5,5′-dipropyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol) is a broad spectrum antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent with potential applications in oral care and personal care products. It has advantages over magnolol, e.g. in that it does not stain toothbrush bristles when used as an antibacterial/anti-inflammatory agent in a toothpaste. Existing synthetic methods for making magnolol derivatives, however, involve costly reagents and yields are low. There is a need for cheaper, higher yield synthetic procedures to make magnolol derivatives.

SUMMARY

Previous synthetic approaches to making magnolol generally start with bromination of biphenyl-2,2′-diol, to get the 5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl-2,2′-diol, followed by O-protection, with methyl or other O-protecting group, reaction with allyl bromide to get the magnolol in protected form, deprotection to get magnolol, which can then be hydrogenated to obtain propyl magnolol. Analogous compounds are made analogously. We have found that on scale up, the step of O-protecting the 5,5′-dibromo-biphenyl-2,2′-diol is inefficient and slow. We have found that carrying out the O-protection step before the bromination step results in a more efficient reaction and higher yields.

The deprotection step is another expensive and yield limiting step in the existing processes. The methods reported for demethylation are often costly, and require sometimes very low temperatures (−78° C. using BBr3) and sometimes reflux conditions. The reaction mixture is always difficult to separate and purify which results in low yield of magnolol. We have found that the use of an aluminium chloride/thiourea complex for deprotection does not require extreme temperatures or expensive reagents and results in high yields.

Finally, we avoid the need for a bromination step or a hydrogenation step or a difficult separation of alkyl analogs of magnolol from magnolol by introducing the alkyl group by Friedel-Crafts acylation of 2,2′-bianisole followed by Clemmensen reduction of the alkionyl derivative.

The invention thus provides a simple, relatively high yield synthesis for 5,5′-dialkyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diols, comprising(i) methylating biphenyl-2,2′-diol using dimethyl sulfate, to obtain 2,2′-dimethoxy-biphenyl;(ii) acylating the 2,2′-dimethoxy-biphenyl with alkionyl halide, for example propionyl chloride, to obtain the corresponding 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dialkionyl-biphenyl;(iii) reducing the 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dialkionyl-biphenyl to obtain 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dialkyl-biphenyl;(iv) demethylating the 2,2′-dimethoxy-5,5′-dipropyl-biphenyl by reaction with aluminium chloride and thiourea; and(v) recovering the 5,5′-dialkyl-biphenyl-2,2′-diol thus obtained;wherein “alk” or “alkyl” refers to linear, branched or cyclic C2-10alkyl, for example selected from n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, and isobutyl, e.g., n-propyl.

Further areas of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating the preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to a process for the boundary layer carbonation of solid particulate Trona ore to produce sodium bicarbonate. Impure Trona ore is generally comprised of mixtures of sodium sesquicarbonate (Na2CO3.NaHCO3.2H2O) with other, materials, e.g., alkali minerals such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate, as well as shales and clays. The invention also relates to such a process for the production of sodium bicarbonate useful in the desulfurization of flue gas.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The conventional technique utilized in the commercial production of sodium bicarbonate is the solution process. In the solution process, soda ash is dissolved in spent reaction liquor from prior reaction, consisting of water and small quantities of dissolved soda ash and sodium bicarbonate. The solution is then carbonated by sparging CO2to the bottom of large carbonate columns to precipitate crystals of sodium bicarbonate. Carbonation of sodium bicarbonate is an example of a gas-liquid-solid reaction. The sodium bicarbonate crystals are typically separated from the liquor using centrifuges and dried to yield highly purified, high density crystals. Disadvantages of the conventional method are that the procedure requires several steps, and necessitates the use of separation equipment, drying of the product, and the handling of large volumes of liquids.

It has also been proposed to make sodium bicarbonate by various “dry carbonation” techniques. In U.S. Pat. No. 276,990 (Carey et al.) and U.S. Pat. No. 574,089 (Hawliczek), a sodium bicarbonate product is formed by placing hydrated soda ash in a revolving cylinder and then introducing carbon dioxide into the cylinder. In both patents, reaction times are of the order of five to six hours.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,365 (Saeman) teaches a process in which hollow sodium bicarbonate beads of low density are prepared in a multistage reactor from hydrated soda ash, small amounts of water and carbon dioxide. This process requires several steps and must proceed slowly, with carbonation times exceeding one hour and drying times up to eight hours. The soda ash must first be hydrated in a separate step, and the reaction must occur at a temperature above 95.7° F. to produce commercially acceptable reaction rates.

More recently, Krieg et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272), (owned by the assignee of the present invention) described a process for the preparation of sodium bicarbonate by the reaction of a solid, particulate sodium carbonate-containing material with liquid water in a carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. In the Krieg process, the particulate mass is mixed with the water and carbon dioxide in an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor. The reaction is carried out at temperatures of from 125° F. to 240° F. under atmospheres containing from 20% to 90% carbon dioxide by volume. Using Krieg's terminology, the “dry carbonation” process is carried out under reduced water vapor partial pressures to promote evaporation of water from the surfaces of the reacting carbonate particles, and to maintain high carbon dioxide partial pressures in the reactor atmosphere. Products formed by the process have apparent bulk densities as high as 50-60 lb/ft3.

On the other hand, Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose that in the dry carbonation of sodium carbonate, it is necessary to react a substantially saturated feed gas stream (relative humidity in excess of 90%) to maintain adequate reaction rates.

Kurtz, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,919,910 (also owned by the assignee of the present invention) disclose a process for the dry carbonation of potassium carbonate, which comprises reacting dry potassium carbonate, carbon dioxide and water vapor at atmospheric pressure and under turbulent mixing conditions to produce potassium bicarbonate.

WO 93/11070, published Jun. 10, 1993 and issued to Falotico and owned by the assignee of the present invention, a process is provided for the dry carbonation of Trona, which comprises:(a) passing Trona particles through a reaction zone (e.g., an internally agitated or externally rotated or vibrated reactor);(b) introducing into the reaction zone a gas stream containing from about 12% to 100% carbon dioxide by volume, any remaining percentage of the gas stream being an inert gas such as air or nitrogen, the gas stream being heated to a temperature within the range of about 140° F. to about 160° F. [about 60° to about 71.1° C.], preferably about 150° F. to about 155° F. [about 65.6° to about 68.3° C];(c) initiating the reaction by introducing water into the reaction zone to form a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b);(d) thereafter during the course of the reaction, intermittently introducing water into the reaction zone to form “a gas mixture of water vapor and the gas stream from step (b), so that the water vapor content of the gas mixture reaches essentially 100% of saturation at the temperature of the gas stream from step (b), if required to maintain the reaction with a gas stream containing less than 100% CO2;(e) maintaining the gas mixture or gas stream in direct contact with the Trona particles during the reaction and continuing the reaction with production of water from the Trona and no external source of water when the gas stream is close to 100% CO2, until the sodium carbonate in the Trona particles is essentially all converted to sodium bicarbonate with a water content of less than about 4 percent by weight;(g) discharging the gas stream or gas mixture from the reaction zone after contact with the particles, and(h) discharging from the reaction zone reacted particles having a lower bulk density, a higher specific surface area and consequently higher absorption property than the Trona feed, and a water content of less than 4 percent by weight and different amounts of impurities (up to 20%) depending on their presence in the starting Trona ore, wherein sodium bicarbonate product formed by the dry carbonation has a surface area of about 0.3 m2/g. In contrast “wet” produced sodium bicarbonate has a surface area from about 0.05 to 0.09 m2/g.

Unfortunately, the process as proposed in WO 93/11070 requires at least 3 hours to convert the Trona to at least 98% sodium bicarbonate during a continuous reaction.

Prior art “dry carbonation” techniques are subject to particular disadvantages. In some of these processes, the carbon dioxide concentration must be high and the reaction temperature must also be high, or the reaction rate is prohibitively low. In some, the product must be dried. Despite a passing reference to the use of calcined Trona in U.S. Pat. No. 4,459,272, none of the patents disclose the surprising benefits and properties that result from the boundary layer carbonation process of the present invention.

Sodium bicarbonate has also been produced, as well as utilized, in dry sorbent injection processes for removing sulfur dioxide emissions from the combustion gases of fossil fuel-fired burners. Such techniques have commanded considerable attention recently, particularly because they present the lowest “first cost” alternative for removing potentially dangerous sulfur dioxide and other gases from flue gases. Sodium bicarbonate has been demonstrated to be a very effective sorbent in the dry sorbent injection process. However, the cost of pharmaceutical and food grade sodium bicarbonate, as currently produced, is a major drawback to its use for such purpose.

U.S. Pat. No. 3,846,535 (Fonseca) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,385,039 (Lowell et al.) disclose, methods for regenerating sodium bicarbonate from sulfate-containing solid waste formed by dry sorbent injection with sodium bicarbonate. The Fonseca regeneration step is carried out by forming an aqueous solution of the sodium sulfate-containing waste, and treating such solution with ammonium bicarbonate to precipitate sodium bicarbonate. The sodium bicarbonate is then separated, dried and recycled for further use. Lowell et al. disclose a regeneration step which involves dissolving the solid desulfurization reaction product in an alkaline liquor, which contains borate ions and/or ammonia. Carbonation of this liquor results in a sodium bicarbonate precipitate. The Fonseca and Lowell et al. processes thus both suffer from the use of complicated and capital intensive solution operations.

Sarapata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,664,893, mentioned above, also disclose that their “dry carbonation” process may be used to desulfurize flue gas streams, wherein the flue gas is contacted with a solid alkali metal or ammonium bicarbonate containing sorbent to react with sulfur dioxide in the flue gas. The resulting solid waste is separated and removed from the gas stream. The cleansed gas stream, from which the solid waste has been removed, is cooled; the gas stream is saturated with water vapor; and the gas stream is thoroughly mixed with a particulate alkali metal or ammonium carbonate. The bicarbonate produced thereby is then utilized to contact the hot flue gas for further desulfurization thereof.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

This patent discloses a boundary layer carbonation process for the production of sodium bicarbonate from Trona. In one embodiment the process comprises the steps of: providing Trona particles; pre-wetting the Trona particles with water to provide a plurality of pre-wetted Trona particles; and boundary layer carbonating the pre-wetted Trona particles to convert the pre-wetted Trona particles into crystals of sodium bicarbonate having a surface area between 0.7 m2/g and 1.6 m2/g.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement generally, and more particularly to a toothbrush that releases a chemical into the mouth during use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A toothbrush is used to clean the teeth by removing plaque and debris from the tooth surfaces. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. The papillary nature of the tongue surface creates a unique ecological site that provides an extremely large surface area, favoring the accumulation of oral bacteria. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play an important role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can lead to bad breath or oral malodor.

While consumers may seek to clean their tongue or teeth, there has not been a toothbrush which provides a chemical sensory response in a mouth to enhance a user's brushing experience. Further, consumers have not been provided with a visual method to select a toothbrush which provides a sensory response. Hence, there is a need for a toothbrush that provides a biochemical sensory effect when in contact tissues of the mouth and supports a method to visually communicate the sensory effect to a user prior to use.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention pertains to an oral care implement, such as a toothbrush, including a sensory material that invokes a selective sensory response when in contact with the tissues and surfaces of a mouth of a user.

In one embodiment, a toothbrush includes a releasable material that causes a trigeminal response during use. In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a tissue cleanser provided with the releasable material.

In another embodiment, a toothbrush includes a communicative element, such as a two-dimensional or three-dimensional shape, that is visually representative of the sensory response to the user.

In yet another embodiment, the invention can be A toothbrush comprising: a handle and a head; a releasable sensory material that invokes a sensory response in an oral cavity during use; and at least one communicative element that is visually representative of the sensory response.

In still another embodiment, the invention can be an oral care implement comprising: a handle and a head; a releasable sensory material that invokes a sensory response in an oral cavity during use; and an elastomeric element comprising a shape that is visually representative of the sensory response.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to animal litters, and in particular to animal litters that have been chemically modified, wherein the litter is found surprisingly effective in mitigating urine and fecal odors.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In an effort to efficiently and effectively collect animal urine and/or feces, various methods and compositions are known to utilize absorbent materials in litter boxes and animal cages. In particular, clays (primarily bentonite) have been used as a base material for absorbent animal litters for some time. These materials become tacky when wetted, thereby forming a “clump” that is easily removed from a litter box. Many animals, especially felines, will often refuse to use a litter box that is not kept scrupulously clean. Clumpable animal litters facilitate the ease of cleaning, because otherwise the litter box has to be periodically dumped and refilled to maintain appropriate cleanliness.

Clays such as those based on the clay minerals kaolinite, illite, attapulgite, montmorillonite, sepiolite, diatomite, and the like, have been used extensively in animal litter compositions due to their water and moisture absorbing properties. However these materials have very little, if any, deodorizing properties.

Numerous attempts in prior art to modify liquid absorbing material (i.e. clays) within the litter to optimize its odor-inhibiting property are well known. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 2,895,873 to Sawyer et al., which teaches clay materials that are treated with sulfuric acid to form in-situ certain acidic salts. The treated clays neutralize basic odors that are originated from animal waste or decomposition.

Another example is PCT Application No. WO 0053001 to Simmler-Hübenthal et al., which teaches a litter that contains clays such as bentonite and a solid peroxo compound such as magnesium or calcium peroxide.

Another example is European Patent No. EP 1240821 to Haimerl et al., which teaches an animal litter that includes peroxo compound and calcium bentonite that is treated with hops extract to achieve a beta-acid content of 900 ppm.

In yet another example, U.S. Patent No. 2006/0088498 to Martin et al. teaches an animal litter that contains a solvent-activated reactor. The reactor is formed from a core that contains reactants such as calcium and magnesium peroxide.

Although the above-mentioned litters reduce odors to some degree, it is still desirable to further optimize liquid absorbing materials to achieve drastic reduction of malodors, and to simultaneously provide an economical method to produce such litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed toward a modified animal litter comprising at least one acid-activated liquid absorbing material in combination with at least one peroxide, wherein the litter provides a surprisingly steady and consistent suppression of malodors that are generated from animal waste.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

In a mammal, a tooth is comprised of an inner dentin layer and a protective outer hard enamel layer. The enamel layer of a tooth is naturally an opaque white or slightly off-white color; the enamel layer, however, may become stained or discolored. The enamel layer of a tooth is composed of hydroxyapatite mineral crystals that create a somewhat porous surface. It is believed that the porous nature of the enamel allows staining agents and discoloring substances to permeate the enamel layer and occupy the microscopic spaces and eventually alter the color of the tooth.

Consumers wishing to alter the color of their teeth have a limited variety of products from which to choose. Successful application of some color altering products, such as veneers, crowns, and caps, involves destruction of tooth enamel, and requires the services of a dental professional. Alternatively, a variety of less destructive oral care formulations are known in the art which may be applied to the surface of a tooth and purport to alter the color of the tooth enamel.

Use of a permanent coloring coat for teeth by application of dry powdered colored particles to a layer of glue applied to the buccal surface of the teeth is known in the art. Other conventional means of addressing tooth discoloration include whitening teeth by application of a liquid dental composition containing a peroxide whitening constituent dispersed in an aqueous liquid vehicle and a film forming component or applying metallic oxides simultaneously having film-forming and pigmenting properties simulate the approximate color of natural.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides compositions and methods of altering the color of a tooth. The compositions are tooth-coating compositions that include (i) a colorant that imparts color to teeth, such as hydroxyapatite-containing particles and (ii) at least one acrylate polymer. The application of the composition to a tooth, such as a human tooth, coats the tooth thereby altering its color. Also included in the invention are methods of altering the color of a tooth by application of the compositions and methods of preparing the composition.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to oral care systems, kits and methods, and specifically to a system, kit and method including a toothbrush having an open cavity that retains a removable dispenser containing an oral care fluid.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Oral care products or agents are applied in different ways. For example, without limitation, a common technique used for tooth whitening products is to cast an impression of a person's teeth and provide a tray of the shape of this impression. A person then only needs to add a whitening composition to the tray and to apply the tray to his/her teeth. This is left in place for a period of time and then removed. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten. Another technique is to use a strip that has a whitening composition on one surface. This strip is applied to a person's teeth and left in place for about 30 minutes. After several applications the teeth are gradually whitened. Yet another technique is to apply a whitening composition to teeth using a small brush. This brush is repeatedly dipped back into the container during the application of the tooth whitening composition to ones teeth. After a few treatments the teeth gradually whiten.

A problem with existing brushing techniques is that saliva in the mouth contains the enzyme catalase. This enzyme will catalize the decomposition of peroxides. The brush can pick up some catalase during the application of some of the whitening product to teeth and transport that catalase back to the bottle. This catalase now in the bottle can degrade the peroxide in the bottle. Another problem with this latter technique is that it does not adapt for use with anhydrous whitening compositions. Here the brush may transport moisture from saliva from the mouth back into the bottle. This will have a negative effect on the whitening composition by potentially decomposing the peroxide active ingredient. In addition, if a person washes the brush each time after use, moisture from the wet bristles can enter the bottle.

While tray-based systems are suitable, many people do not use them due to the fact that they tend to be uncomfortable and/or awkward. Moreover, in order to use a whitening tray, a user must keep the tray and the required components at hand. This not only requires extra storage space in already cramped bathroom cabinets but also requires that the user remember to use the whitening system. Furthermore, these tray-based systems are not conveniently portable for transport and/or travel.

In addition to difficulties in applying some oral care products, storage is sometimes cumbersome and inconvenient for the user. The oral care product must typically be stored separately from oral care tooth cleaning implements such as a toothbrush since the oral care product package and toothbrush heretofore are generally treated as separate and distinct parts of an oral care regimen.

A more portable, compact and convenient way to store oral care products, and to dispense and apply those oral care products to oral surfaces is desired.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the present invention provide an efficient, compact, and portable oral care system that combines an oral care implement such as a toothbrush with an oral care product or agent dispenser in a highly portable and convenient housing. Advantageously, such embodiments are especially suited for easy transport and/or travel.

Preferred embodiments of the present invention are directed to a toothbrush having an open cavity in its handle that retains a removable dispenser containing a fluid, such as an oral care fluid, reservoir. In some exemplary embodiments, the oral care fluid includes oral care agents, either active or non-active, that may include without limitation whitening, enamel protection, anti-sensitivity, fluoride, tartar protection, or other agents. The dispenser can be detachably docked and stored at least partially within the handle of the toothbrush so that a gripping portion of the dispenser protrudes from the toothbrush for access to a user permitting easy removal and use of the dispenser. In some embodiments, the dispenser is configured as and forms a removable portion of the handle itself. The dispenser can be completely removable from the toothbrush in certain embodiments so that the user can apply the fluid to his/her teeth with ease, and then reinsert the dispenser in the toothbrush for convenient storage. In certain embodiments, the dispenser may be a pen-like component. The toothbrush can removably and non-fixedly secure the dispenser within the handle so that the dispenser can be repetitively removed and reinserted therein. In some embodiments, the dispenser may be adapted to be user-refillable for repeated use.

According to one embodiment of the present invention, an oral care system includes a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush. In some embodiments, the dispenser may form a constituent portion of a handle of the toothbrush. The dispenser may include a housing having an internal reservoir configured for containing a fluid, a dispensing orifice in the housing in fluid communication with the reservoir, and a fluid delivery system. The fluid delivery system may be a ratcheting type dispensing system in one embodiment including a ratchet rod extending into the reservoir, an actuator operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting movement thereto, and a two-piece plunger assembly operably coupled to the ratchet rod and axially movable within the housing by activation of the actuator. The plunger assembly forms a selectively-positionable transverse end wall of the reservoir, which in some embodiments is movable or advanceable only in a single axial direction. The plunger assembly includes an outer cup seal slidably engaged with the housing and an inner plunger disposed at least partially in the cup seal. The plunger also includes a pawl movably engaged with ratchet rod, wherein activation of the actuator moves the plunger assembly in a first direction and dispenses the fluid from the reservoir via the orifice.

According to one embodiment of the present invention, an oral care system includes a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably coupled to the toothbrush. The dispenser includes a housing having a distal dispensing end, a proximal actuating end, and an internal reservoir configured for containing a fluid defined therebetween. A dispensing orifice may be disposed in the distal dispensing end of the housing in fluid communication with the reservoir for delivering the fluid. The dispenser further includes a fluid delivery system including a ratchet rod extending into the reservoir, a resiliently deformable actuator disposed on the actuating end of the housing and operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting movement thereto, and a plunger assembly operably coupled to the ratchet rod and axially movable within the housing in a first direction by activation of the actuator. The plunger assembly forms a selectively-positionable end wall of the reservoir. In some embodiments, the actuator may be formed of a self-biasing elastomeric material having an elastic memory and being biased towards the operating end of the housing. Depressing the actuator deforms and partially collapses the actuator inwards and moves the ratchet rod and plunger assembly together in the first direction and dispenses the fluid from the reservoir via the orifice. Releasing the actuator causes the actuator to reassume an un-depressed and undeformed position under the self-biasing force of the actuator material elastic memory. This retracts the ratchet rod in a second direction opposite the first. The plunger assembly remains stationary in an advanced axial position.

A method for dispensing an oral care product from an oral care system is also provided. In one embodiment, the method includes: providing an oral care system including a toothbrush and a dispenser detachably mounted to the toothbrush, the dispenser including a distal dispensing end, a proximal operating end, and reservoir containing an oral care product. The dispenser may further include a ratcheting fluid dispensing mechanism including: a ratchet rod axially movable within the housing; a resiliently deformable push button formed of an elastomeric material and operably coupled to the ratchet rod for imparting motion thereto, the push button having an elastic memory and being self-biased towards an undeformed inactive position; and a plunger assembly axially slidable within the housing and including a pawl operably coupled to the ratchet rod, the plunger assembly forming a movable end wall of the reservoir. The method further includes the steps of: detaching the dispenser from toothbrush; depressing the push button, wherein the push button becomes activated and deformed; moving the ratchet rod and plunger assembly together in a first distal axial direction wherein the plunger assembly is moved from a first position to a second position and oral care product is dispensed; releasing the push button, wherein the push button is returned to the undeformed inactive position under the self-biasing force of the push button; and retracting the ratchet rod in a second proximal direction, wherein the plunger assembly remains stationary in the second position.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Tooth brushing is part of a daily oral hygiene activity. Proper dental care involves regular flossing, brushing and dental checkups. According to the American Dental Association, a major source of bad breath in healthy people is microbial deposits on the tongue, where a bacterial coating harbors organisms and debris that contribute to bad breath. Tissue in the mouth, and especially the tongue, is a haven for the growth of microorganisms. Anaerobic flora and bacteria residing on the tongue and other soft tissues in the mouth play a role in the development of chronic bad breath commonly called halitosis. In general, the bacteria produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSC). If there is enough buildup of the sulfur compounds, the result can be bad breath or oral malodor.

Dentists generally recommend that an individual brush his or her teeth for a minimum interval per cleaning, such as two minutes. Despite such recommendations, many individuals, especially young children, do not regularly brush their teeth for the recommended minimum interval. Such habits often can be attributed to the individual regarding tooth brushing as a mundane duty with few pleasurable aspects. Dental checkups to a dentist office are typically the only feedback a person receives on their dental cleaning efforts. There is unfortunately ample time between checkups for poor dental habits to cause problems. For example, gingivitis, periodontal disease, and a host of other problems can be magnified if poor dental cleaning habits are not rectified promptly.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Aspects of the present invention are directed to providing an oral care implement (such as a toothbrush) having an oral care diagnostic feature. Various aspects of the oral care implement may improve dental care by providing feedback on a user's brushing efforts.

Further aspects are directed to providing a health profile to the user based on information from such a diagnostically-capable oral care implement, or a conventional oral care implement. The health profile may be created by analyzing information obtained from the oral care implement and presenting representations of certain health aspects. The health aspects may include indications relating, for example, to whether certain oral or non-oral diseases are suspected, as well as to whether certain brushing techniques are being properly executed. This type of health profile may, in certain circumstances, provide even more information to a user than may be available via feedback provided by the oral care implement itself.

Still further aspects are directed to providing a health profile service business, such as over the Internet and/or through a brick-and-mortar boutique storefront. In such a case, data from the oral care implement, or even the oral care implement itself, may be provided to the health profile service. The service may in turn process the data and/or oral care implement to generate the health profile, which is then provided to the customer/user of the oral care implement.

"BACKGROUND

The embodiments relate to dentifrice compositions containing minor amounts of relatively small particle size high cleaning abrasives, without antibacterial agents, fluorides, and other oral care actives. In particular, dentifrice compositions having good stain removal characteristics. The dentifrice compositions can be in the form of encapsulated compositions, solid confectionary compositions, gums, and the like, which optionally may be positioned within the bristles of a tooth brushing device.

Conventional abrasives include silica, for example in the form of silica gel, hydrated silica or precipitated silica, alumina, insoluble phosphates, calcium carbonate, resinous abrasives such as urea-formaldehyde condensation products and the like. Among insoluble phosphates useful as abrasives are orthophosphates, polymetaphosphates and pyrophosphates. Illustrative examples are dicalcium orthophosphate dihydrate, calcium pyrophosphate, β-calcium pyrophosphate, tricalcium phosphate, calcium polymetaphosphate, sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), tetrasodium pyrophosphate (TSPP), and insoluble sodium polymetaphosphate. One or more abrasives typically are present in a dentifrice in an abrasive effective total amount, typically 5% to 70%, for example 10% to 50% or 15% to 30% by weight of the composition. The average particle size of an abrasive is generally 0.1 to 30 μm, for example 1 to 20 μm or 5 to 15 μm.

Synthetically produced silicas play an important role as an ingredient in many of today's toothpaste formulations. Such silicas are relatively safe, nontoxic, ingredients which are compatible with other toothpaste ingredients, including glycerin, sorbitol (or xylitol), thickening agents, detergents, coloring and fragrance materials and optionally fluoride and other actives, whereby the silica acts as an abrasive to clean teeth, remove plaque and food debris.

As an abrasive, silicas debride and physically scrub the external surface of the teeth. This scrubbing action removes the organic film (i.e. the pellicle), formed of salivary proteins which covers the teeth and which is known to become stained and discolored by foods, such as coffee, tea and berries, as well as, by tobacco smoke, cationic antibacterials, and chromogenic bacteria. Such physical removal of the stained pellicle is a simple and effective means of removing the undesirable surface staining and discoloration which occurs daily. Further, such physical removal of the pellicle also removes plaque bacteria on the pellicle surface.

Synthetic silicas include both silica gels and precipitated silicas which are prepared by the neutralization of aqueous silicate solutions with a strong mineral acid. In the preparation of silica gel, a silica hydrogel is fanned which is then typically washed to low salt content. The washed hydrogel may be milled to the desired size, or otherwise dried, ultimately to the point where its structure no longer changes as a result of shrinkage. When preparing such synthetic silicas, the objective is to obtain abrasives which provide maximal cleaning (i.e. removal of stained pellicle) with minimal damage to the tooth enamel and other oral tissue. Dental researchers are continually concerned with identifying synthetic silicas meeting these objectives.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,680 and GB Patent Application 2,038,303A both disclose the general use of silica hydrogels or hydrated silica gels as dentifrice polishing agents. U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,826 discloses the use of hydrated silica gels in combination with a weakly calcined alumina polish, to form a combination abrasive system. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,943,429, 5,176,899 and 5,270,033 provide lists of alternative polishing agents, such lists including hydrated silica gels.

U.S. Pat. No. 5,939,051 discloses dentifrice compositions prepared with silica gels having low abrasion and high cleaning products. However, the silica gels have a low particle size distribution of from 2 to 4 microns in order to achieve the low abrasive properties. Manufacturing such small particle size silica gel is energy intensive and relatively costly.

U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,553 and 5,651,958 disclose dentifrice compositions containing a combination of precipitated silica and silica gels having high cleaning and low abrasion as indicated by their low radioactive dentin abrasion (RDA) values. Due to the low abrasive nature of the silicas described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,651,958 and 5,658,553 the composition inherently has limited cleaning ability.

RDA value is a dental art recognized method of determining the abrasiveness of dentifrice formulations and is determined according to the method recommended by the American Dental Association as set forth by Hefferren, Journal of Dental Research, Volume 55, Issue 4, July-August 1976, pp. 563-573, and described in the Wason U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,583, 4,420,312 and 4,421,527.

It is known in the dental art that increasing the RDA value of a dentifrice composition above 110 does not result in a corresponding increase in the cleaning performance of the dentifrice, as measured by Pellicle Cleaning Ratio (PCR), an in vitro method used to measure the efficacy of removing tea and coffee tooth stains relative to a standard. The PCR values referred to herein are obtained by a modification of the method described in “In Vitro Removal of Stain with Dentifrice”, G. K. Stookey, et alJ. Dental Research,61, 123-9, 1982. The modification of the PCR method used herein is described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,658,553 and 5,651,958. In this modification, a clear pellicle material is applied to a bovine tooth first, which is then stained with a combination of the pellicle material and tea, coffee and FeCl3whereas in the original method described by Stookey et al, both pellicle and stain are applied simultaneously.

Silica particles referred to as “high cleaning” silica are known and described in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,306,788, 7,267,814, 6,896,876, 6,669,929. Many of these are commercially available from J. M. Huber (Havre de Grace, Md. USA), sold under the trade name Zeodent™. Other silicas are designed to replace a portion of conventional silicas to enhance or boost their cleaning efficacy, as described in, for example, U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2009/0010973, 2006/0008423, 2006/0008422, 2005/0129628.

Dentifrice compositions in the form of solid, semi-solid, or encapsulated compositions positioned within the bristles of a tooth brushing device are known. Colgate® WISP™ is one such device. The Wisp device is a small tooth brushing device (about 8.9 cm (3.5 inches)) in length) that includes a gelatin encapsulated liquid composition positioned within the bristles. The liquid capsule releases a burst of freshness when used, without the need for water or rinsing. The Wisp is designed to be used once, and then discarded.

There remains a need to provide a dentifrice composition that is not necessarily intended to be used as a toothpaste or gel, that does not necessarily contain oral care actives, and that is effective in removing stains and cleaning teeth.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

This application is related to French Patent Application Serial No. 07/53878 filed Mar. 16, 2007 and takes priority therefrom.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention concerns a depilatory (epilatory) polymeric composition with controlled temperature setting of use. The novel depilatory/epilatory polymeric composition is directly applicable to the skin with removal by peeling, preferentially without an additional support strip.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A well known principle permits enclosure of hair in a polymeric matrix in the form of a strip and the manual removal of the strip by peeling to ensure hair extraction. For reasons of depilatory effectiveness, non aqueous polymeric compositions are generally preferred. Nevertheless, the requirements these depilatory polymeric compositions must meet are numerous and, for some, difficult to reconcile.

One requirement is to be able to bring and maintain the depilatory polymeric composition during the depilation process to a temperature adapted to provide the desired temperature in a fast and practical way.

Another important factor is the time for depilation duration, which time needs to be reduced because the depilation practice is tedious, and professionals as well as consumers wish to dedicate the least possible time to it.

Also, not only should the heating time be reduced, but the duration for which the polymeric depilatory composition remains usable during the depilation process should be the longest possible. Such duration of use is the interval during which the depilatory polymeric composition remains at a temperature acceptable for the skin, that is compatible with its homogeneous, easy and painless application, in a thin layer with a spatula or any appropriated applicator in order to be able to enclose the hair to be pulled. Currently, the duration of use, according to the here above-defined meaning, is in the order of 10 minutes for a 400 g pot of composition formulated according to the prior art.

Aesthetic criteria are important in that they can contribute to regular epilation practices; in addition, the epilatory polymeric compositions should also help to improve the overall experience of epilation by being able to adhere to short hair, therefore improving the epilation quality. The adherence of the composition to the hair has been incorporated into the formulation so as to obtain a very satisfactory and immediate high quality epilation, leaving only minimally visible, less numerous and shorter hair. Such improvement of the adherence also offers the possibility to proceed with a new epilation on short hair without having to wait for hair to regrow to a significant and unsightly length.

A depilatory polymeric composition must also meet other important requirements, regarding its rheology. Indeed, it is necessary to apply the depilatory polymeric composition in a thin layer, at a temperature acceptable for sensitive areas of the skin, without provoking the formation of threads susceptible to disrupt handling. Once the wax is frozen on the skin and the hair enclosed, it is essential that the strip produced be removed by hand, by peeling, in a single, fast movement. This entails that the laid strip should keep a certain deformability, suppleness and flexibility. On the other hand, these parameters must remain within values that do not affect negatively the cohesion of said strip and avoid stretching, making the removal of the strip difficult and risking the formation of composition deposits or residues adhering to the skin, which residues are always difficult and unpleasant to eliminate from the skin. In particular, for compositions forming strips on the skin, the composition rheology should be adapted to permit strip removal when the composition reaches a temperature at which the strip surface no longer adheres to the finger, i.e. a temperature at which the strip adheres minimally to the skin while keeping the required abilities for adhering to the hair.

Considering the intended use of the product, the depilatory polymeric composition may include at least dyes and/or perfumes for the sake of aesthetics. It is also possible to include solid particles or fibers, or ingredients intended notably to modify the presentation or aspect.

The prior art proposed depilatory waxes as described in French patent No. 2 751 872. However, such waxes only very partially met the requirements recited above, not permitting namely a homogeneous heating by a microwave heating oven.

Another European patent EP No. 299 816 proposed a rosin and elastomer-based depilatory composition of a disposable type. That patent, although not providing sufficient information, is characterized by the combination of an elastomeric or thermoplastic macromolecular compound, rosin and a plasticizer.

This invention proposes a depilatory polymeric composition that meets the numerous requirements described above, that is industrially feasible, comfortable to apply, and easy to use by consumers.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to powdered absorbing compositions containing clay. More particularly it relates to absorbing compositions that can be used as animal litter such as cat litter. More specifically it relates to absorbing compositions such as cat litter, containing de-dusting and deodorizing agents and a method of forming same.

DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART

Nowadays it is common that pet owners train their animals such as cats into a habit of urinating and defecating into a special litter pan containing powdered absorbent materials commonly known as litter. The pet owner later collects urine-saturated portions of the litter and feces. Similarly, caged animals such as guinea pigs use absorbent litter in their cages. The absorbent materials for this purpose often include discrete clay and filler particles. These small sized particles create dust. Dusting is one of the major negative attributes of handling powdered materials. The airborne dust usually consists of particles smaller than 25 microns and represents a minor portion of the litter, which is about equal or less than 1%. The major problem with handling cat litter occurs when it is being transferred from a box or a bag into the cat litter pan. The particles of powdered materials create airborne dust that is particularly noticeable and unpleasant to a person transferring the litter. Additionally, small particles become airborne when the animal attempts to cover the area of the litter that it used most recently and they are easily tracked out of the litter pan on the animal's paws ending up on the floor or the carpet or even a couch.

Clay and other particulates are common materials used in various animal litters (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 4,671,208 to Smith, U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,989 to Rosenfeld, U.S. Pat. No. 5,359,961 to Goss et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,294,118 B1 to Huber et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,291 to Lawson et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 6,962,129 to Lawson). No matter what the constituents of the compositions are, there remains the nuisance of the airborne dust.

Consequently, there is a need for an absorbing composition that would address the problem of dust associated with materials such as an animal litter. Such a composition would not be prone to dusting when handled and would include an inexpensive de-dusting agent that would be safe and non-irritating to the animal.

A composition comprising sodium bentonite, a mixture of limestone and dolomite or calcite and a de-dusting agent of guar gum has previously been produced by adding an aqueous solution of the guar gum to the limestone and dolomite mixture by spraying the guar gum solution onto the falling curtain of limestone and dolomite from a belt scale to a transfer screw conveyer. The transfer screw conveyer mixes the guar gum solution with the filler particles. The guar gum treated filler was then combined with the remaining ingredients, in particular, the sodium bentonite, to form the composition. Alternatively, powdered de-dusting agents were distributed on a moving bed of fillers, and water sprayed on the fillers/de-dusting agent mixture, so as to stick the de-dusting agent onto the filler. This method provides more de-dusting agent into the product. The addition of sodium bicarbonate particles to the composition, improves odor control of the animal litter.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The object of the invention is to provide an absorbent composition that includes a powdery material, which produces less airborne dust when handled, and has added odor control.

There is provided an absorbent composition for water-based liquids, wherein dusting normally associated with handling of powdered absorbent materials is significantly reduced. The composition can be an animal litter, such as cat litter. The composition comprises a water-absorbing material, a filler, a de-dusting agent, and an odor control agent.

A method of preparing the composition is also provided which allows for sufficient de-dusting agents to be readily included in the composition, and a composition having improved odor control.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to peroxide-containing compositions, and more particularly to peroxide-containing cleaning compositions exhibiting enhanced peroxide stability.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide have a bleaching effect on organic substances and are therefore used in, for example, detergents, cleaning compositions, disinfectants, deodorizers and hair coloring products. Peroxide-based solutions are well-known for their oxidative and antimicrobial properties, and have been used in washing and cleaning processes. Generally, to clean a substrate such as clothing, the substrate is subjected to hydrogen peroxide or a substance capable of generating perhydroxyl ions (HOO−), such as inorganic or organic peroxides. Upon contact with the surface of the soiled substrate, the peroxide effectively removes common stains such as coffee or wine, while disinfecting the cleaned surface.

To be effective, peroxide-containing solutions must contain a sufficient amount of peroxide to both clean and disinfect. Accordingly, it is desirable to add ingredients and employ conditions which maximize the activity of peroxides. However, peroxide compounds are very labile. The amount of peroxide in cleaning compositions typically decreases as a function of time under normal storage conditions. Ingredients and conditions which favor maximizing the activity of peroxides, likewise, reduce the stability of peroxides under storage conditions. This creates a problem with efficacy.

Accordingly, it would be useful to formulate a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting enhanced peroxides while improving the stability of the peroxides under storage conditions. There is a need for a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting both enhanced activity and improved peroxide stability.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to a peroxide-containing cleaning composition exhibiting improved peroxide stability with extended shelf-life. The peroxide-containing cleaning composition of the present invention is specifically formulated for enhanced cleaning (bleaching) activity, while substantially improving peroxide stability. The peroxide-containing cleaning composition of the present invention can be used in a range of cleaning products including, but not limited to, laundry detergents, carpet/rug cleaners, glass cleaning products, dish washing compositions, hard surface cleaners, and scouring agents.

"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that provide increased ease of use. More particularly, the test devices include structural and functional elements that improve user handling and evaluation of the device.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Some commercially available assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell or device formed of an elongated outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive a fluid sample transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The use of the test cell requires a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single fluid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

For tests such as those described above, visually observable indicia can be preferred. Such indicia typically have included the presence of agglutination or a color change at a defined site on the assay. More recent efforts have included providing electronic (i.e., digital) signals as the observable indicia. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,763,454, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an electronic analyte assaying device that includes an electronic processing system and a liquid crystal display (LCD). The device includes a chromatographic medium and utilizes electronic components for evaluation of the test as well as display of the test results. Nevertheless, user interface with diagnostic test devices remain limited.

In particular, known point of care or over the counter diagnostic test devices lack an ergonomically favorable structure. As such, it is often difficult for a user to handle the device during application of the test fluid, such as from a urine stream, which can lead to either insufficient fluid application or device flooding. Because of these and other reasons, it would be beneficial to provide a personal use test device with improved ergonomic structure for ease of grip and use.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that include elements useful for carrying out an assay and for providing information related to the assay in an informative display. As an illustrative example, a pregnancy test device can be provided and can include elements for carrying out a test on a fluid sample applied to a receiving member so as to identify the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the sample that is indicative of a pregnancy status. The diagnostic test devices are adapted to provide improved ergonomics and ease of use of the devices in various methods.

In one aspect, the present disclosure relates to a diagnostic test device. The device can comprise a lateral flow test component that is positioned inside a housing. Unlike known personal care test devices that are substantially straight, the presently disclosed test devices comprise a housing that is curved. In particular, the housing can include a substantially arch shaped handle. Further, the housing can comprise a housing body that is interconnected with the housing handle. The handle in some embodiments can be positioned so as to be entirely above the lower surface of the housing body.

Preferably, the diagnostic test device also comprises a base member that can be attached to a curved lower surface of the housing. The base member specifically can comprise a horizontal support surface. In some embodiments, the horizontal support surface can be substantially collinear with a lower surface of the housing body. Further, the base member can extend rearward from the lower surface of the housing body and can increase in height moving rearward. Beneficially, the horizontal support surface of the base member can effectively increase a support length of the lower surface of the housing body by about 5% or greater. Such support length can define the portion of the housing body that is in physical, supporting contact with a substantially flat, horizontal surface when the device is in an upward facing position. In some embodiments, the horizontal support surface of the base member can form an angle α with the curved lower surface of the housing. The value of the angle α can be, for example, about 5° or greater and, more particularly, can be about 5° to about 45°. The horizontal support surface of the base member can have a length of about 10 mm or greater or, more particularly, a length of about 10 mm to about 30 mm. In preferred embodiments, the base member can be monolithically formed with the housing. In some embodiments, the base member can be a single, unitary member. In other embodiments, the base member can be defined by a first base member wall and a second base member wall. Specifically, the base member walls can be curved. For example, the curved base member walls can be defined by a forward section and a rearward section, and the curved base member walls each can comprise a convex curve in the forward sections thereof and a concave curve in the rearward sections thereof with respect to outer surfaces of the walls. More particularly, the curved base member walls can define a width WBM1at the forward section thereof, a width WBM2at a central section thereof, and a width WBM3at the rearward section thereof. In some embodiments, the respective widths can be defined by the formula WBM1<WBM2>WBM3.

In certain embodiments, the housing body can be defined by a lower housing body and an upper housing body. The lower housing body can comprise a sidewall that is defined by an angle relative to a lower surface of the lower housing body. As an example, the angle can be greater than 0° and less than 90°. Similarly, the upper housing body can comprise a sidewall that is defined by an angle relative to an upper surface of the upper housing body. The angle also can be greater than 0° and less than 90°.

In some embodiments, the substantially arch shaped handle can be defined by an ascending section, a transverse section, and a descending section. Further, the handle can be defined by a total height h1that is a distance between an apex of an upper surface of the transverse section of the handle and a lower surface of the housing body, the height h1being about 15 mm or greater and more particularly about 15 mm to about 40 mm. The handle also can have a thickness Thandlethat can be, for example, about 6 mm to about 18 mm. The handle further can be defined by a partial height h2that is a distance between the apex of the upper surface of the transverse section of the handle and a bottom of a terminus of the handle, and h2can be defined by the formula h1>h2>Thandle.

In further embodiments, the substantially arch shaped handle can comprise a concavity (i.e., a thumb grip recess) on an upper surface thereof. The concavity can be defined specifically on the upper surface of the descending section of the handle. The handle also can comprise textures on a lower surface thereof. For instance, the textures can be defined by a plurality of raised members and can comprise, for example, rubber or a further elastomeric material.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can have a length that can be greater than similar devices in the field. For example, the housing in combination with a cap can have an overall length of about 14 to about 20 cm. In certain embodiments, the housing handle can comprise a significant proportion of the overall length of the housing. For example, the handle can comprise about 30% or greater, preferably about 40% or greater, of the total length of the housing.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can comprise additional elements as well. For example, in some embodiments, the housing further comprises a housing midsection interconnecting the housing body and the housing handle. Additionally, the housing further can comprise a display window. As noted above, the device also can comprise a cap that removably engages the housing, particularly at a forward end of the housing body, and can cover a sample receiving member extending outward from the housing body.

The diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure particularly can be characterized by the nature of the sample receiving member extending outward from the housing at a forward end thereof. For example, the sample receiving member can have a surface area of about 15 cm2or greater, particularly about 15 cm2to about 25 cm2. The sample receiving member also can be defined by a thickness of about 1.5 mm to about 2.4 mm, a width of about 16 mm to about 20 mm, and a length of about 45 mm to about 55 mm.

The lateral flow test component provided in the housing of the diagnostic test device can comprise particular elements. In particular, the lateral flow test component can comprise a biphasic substrate or a triphasic substrate. The lateral flow test component similarly can comprise a release medium in fluid communication with a capture medium. Specifically, the release medium can comprise one or more releasably attached antibodies that are reactive with an analyte. In particular embodiments, the analyte can be selected from the group consisting of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), thyroid stimulating hormone, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, a metabolite thereof, and combinations thereof.

In another aspect, the present disclosure also can relate to a method for determining the presence of an analyte in a fluid sample. In some embodiments, the method can comprise the following steps: providing a diagnostic test device comprising a lateral flow test component positioned inside a housing that includes a substantially arch shaped handle and a display window, the lateral flow test component comprising a sample receiving member and one or more substrates adapted for release and capture of one or more antibodies; applying a fluid sample to the sample receiving member; and observing a test result in the display window, the test result being indicative of the presence of the analyte in the liquid sample.

In yet another aspect, the present disclosure can relate to a method for evaluating a test result of a personal use diagnostic test device. In some embodiments, the method can comprise the following steps: carrying out a test with a diagnostic test device comprising a lateral flow test component positioned inside a housing that comprises a housing body interconnected with a substantially arch shaped handle, a display window on an upper surface of the housing by which the test result is visible, and a base member attached to a curved lower surface of the housing; positioning the diagnostic test device at an angle relative to a substantially flat, horizontal surface such that the diagnostic test device is self-maintained at the angle. The diagnostic test device may incorporate a variety of structural components that facilitate self-maintenance of the angled positioning. In one embodiment, the self-maintenance means can be defined by a three point contact with the substantially flat, horizontal surface; and viewing the visible test result in the display window. In particular embodiments, the three point contact can be defined by contact between the substantially flat, horizontal surface and each of a wall of the base member, a side wall of the housing body, and a side wall of the handle. More particularly, the substantially arch shaped handle can be defined by an ascending section and a descending section, and the side wall of the handle defining one of the three point contacts can be in the descending section thereof. In specific embodiments, the angle of the device relative to the substantially flat, horizontal surface can be greater than 0° and less than 90°, more particularly about 10° to about 85°.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of Invention

This invention relates to products and methods for heating comestibles. More particularly, this invention relates to containers and packages that may be used to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles, e.g., in combination microwave and convection ovens.

2. Description of Related Art

Soups, sauces, chilis, and other such liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles are often served in eating establishments, e.g., restaurants and cafeterias. Many eating establishments, especially quick service restaurants (QSR), do not prepare such foods from scratch. Rather, eating establishments often heat up ready-made liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles that were previously prepared and cooked by comestible manufacturers. These comestibles are often packaged and stored at room temperature or are refrigerated or frozen until they are ready to be heated and served.

Eating establishments may use any of a number of different modalities to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. For example, large amounts of soup are often heated at one time in a large pot on a stove or warmer and then transferred to soup bowls, one serving at a time. However, heating a large amount of soup takes a long time. Often, the soup is maintained at a hot temperature for hours until all of it is served or any remaining portion is disposed of. The result is an over-cooked product, much of which goes to waste. In addition, the pot, utensils and soup bowls (unless disposable) will need to be cleaned after use. While microwave ovens may be used to heat such comestibles, a significant number of eating establishments, especially in the QSR segment, do not have microwave ovens.

Increasingly, eating establishments are using combination microwave and convection ovens, such as those sold under the trademark TURBOCHEF®, to cook or reheat essentially solid comestibles. Combination microwave and convection ovens use both microwave energy and convection heating to enable rapid and convenient cooking and heating of comestibles. For example, such ovens can quickly warm hoagies and grinders, leaving the bread crispy rather than soft or soggy, as would be the likely result using a microwave oven alone.

Notwithstanding their increasing popularity in eating establishments, combination microwave and convection ovens are not used to heat liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles because there are currently no feasible means to do so, especially in the QSR setting. Typical microwaveable cookware, such as ceramics, glass, PYREX®, foams, ovenable plastics, or ovenable paper/paperboard, are not practical and in some cases unsuitable for heating soups and the like in combination microwave and convection ovens. Disposable containers made from ovenable paper/paperboard, ovenable plastic and foam can only be used in ambient temperatures of up to about 400° F. Those materials will melt or burn if subjected to the ambient environment of a combination microwave and convection oven, which typically holds at 480° F. or above all day in an eating establishment (especially in a QSR). Thus, while disposable materials are convenient in that they allow for little to no cleanup after use, currently available disposable containers are unfit for direct use in combination microwave and convection ovens.

Ceramics, glass and PYREX®, on the other hand, can withstand ambient temperatures in a combination microwave and convection oven. However, those materials retain a significant amount of heat. Consequently, they can be extremely hot to the touch. In addition, heating comestibles directly in containers made from such reusable materials would require that the containers be cleaned after use. Accordingly, ceramic, glass and PYREX® cookware are inconvenient for an operator to use for heating soups and the like in combination microwave and convection ovens, especially in a QSR setting, where the operator works under tight time constraints. Also, heating soup and the like directly in ceramic, glass or PYREX® cookware in a combination microwave and convection oven can burn or scorch the soup due to the extremely high temperatures in such an oven. Thus, ceramic, glass and PYREX® cookware are not feasible options for an operator, especially in a QSR setting, to deliver a quality product with convenience and speed using a combination microwave and convection oven.

In short, many eating establishments have combination microwave and convection ovens and serve hot liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. But such eating establishments tend not to use such ovens to heat such comestibles because there are no practical and disposable means to do so. This is indeed surprising, considering that combination microwave and convection ovens have been commercially available for many years and have greatly increased in popularity in recent years. Accordingly, there is a need for practical systems and methods that enable liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles to be heated in combination microwave and convection ovens. Such systems and methods should enable rapid and substantially uniform heating of the comestible in a manner that is convenient and would require little to no cleanup. Preferably, such systems and methods would be used for heating single-serving packages of liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestibles. More preferably, such systems and methods would provide thermal protection to a single-serve comestible-containing disposable package so that the package can withstand the high ambient temperatures (e.g., 480° F. to 540° F.) in a combination microwave and convection oven.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Accordingly, there is provided a system for heating a comestible. The system includes a container and a flexible vented package containing a liquid, semi-solid or liquid/solid combination comestible. The package is positioned within the container in a manner that hinders the comestible from escaping through the package's vent(s). The container is penetrable to microwaves and is adapted to not experience heat-induced damage when subjected to a heating cycle in a combination microwave and convection oven. The container is adapted to protect the package from heat-induced damage when the container is subjected to a heating cycle in a combination microwave and convection oven.

In another aspect, there is provided a method of heating a comestible. The method includes subjecting a system to a combination microwave and convection oven heating cycle to heat contents within the system.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to depilatory compositions which can be peeled away from the skin.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

As an alternative to shaving, many hair removal products available today perform through either chemical degradation (depilation) or mechanical removal (epilation) of the hair. Compositions for removing superfluous body hair are well known and are of various types. Currently on the market there are many different types of chemical depilatories and epilation products. Epilatory products, such as waxing, require initial heating before being applied to the skin in a generally molten state. It is then allowed to solidify before being removed from the skin together with unwanted hair.

One major drawback with waxing is the pain associated with hair removal. Waxing works by pulling the hair out from the roots. The hair follicle is surrounded by a small muscle that allows the hair to be erected in response to cold or excitement. Also attached with this muscle are nerve endings.

These structures make pulling the hair out fairly hard and painful. The pain creates a fear associated with the waxing procedure which will cause many people not to repeat the procedure. Even if the person does repeat the waxing, the fear can cause the muscles to tense up, which in turn creates even more pain in subsequent procedures.

Chemical-based depilation offers an attractive alternative to waxing or shaving with the removal of hair being accomplished through the cleavage of disulfide bonds in the hair fiber as well as denaturation of the associated protein matrix. Unlike waxing, chemical-based depilation digests the hair and the hair is not pulled out, thus avoiding the pain associated with waxing. However, a relatively small proportion of individuals, compared with shaving, employ depilatories. One reason for the limited use may be that the hair cleavage reaction must be run at a very high pH. A typical example is the Nair® lotion product, having a pH of about 12.5 to 13.

Chemical-based depilatory compositions typically use a thiol-based depilatory agent, such as thioglycolic acid, for removal of unwanted body and facial hair and its use is well established in the art. These agents react by reducing hair's protein disulfide bonds to sulfhydryl anions, thereby allowing easy removal of the weakened hairs when washed or wiped away. However, in using thiols, it was discovered that certain conditions facilitated the effectiveness of this reaction. One such condition is high alkalinity to provide ionized reactants. Not only does the high pH (approximately 12.0-13) result in ionized thiols, but they also result in increased penetration of a reactant. Substances to provide further enhancement of penetration by active thiols were developed.

Currently on the market there are many different types of chemical depilatories. They range in form from creams to gel to aerosol mousses and spray products. Depilatory composition in the form of a cream is applied to the skin at room temperature. One drawback to many of these depilatory products is the required clean up. As discussed earlier, chemical depilatories contain a strong alkaline, usually a metal hydroxide. In addition, there is usually a reducing agent used. These chemicals can cause considerable damage to the skin if not properly removed. Likewise, they will quickly cause significant damage if they get into the eyes. Product wiped off the skin is still active and will corrode aluminum and many organic materials, creating the possibility of property damage or injury to the user, children or pets through inadvertent contact.

Products have been made to help reduce the risks associated with using these high pH depilatory products by trapping the dangerous chemicals in a solid matrix, i.e., a semi-solid film, after use, thereby simplifying disposal because there will not be liquid which can stick to surfaces. These depilatory products form a dry rubbery film on the skin which after a period of a few minutes can be peeled in one piece from the skin. In this manner, the product is similar to a hot wax depilation. After removal of the product, a very slight residue is left behind, which could be removed with a damp towel. However, unlike wax, the hair will have been digested by chemicals and not pulled out, thereby avoiding the pain associated with pulling out hair as in waxing. Further, there is the elimination of a great deal of mess. European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 to Hori et al. describes such a product.

European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 describes a depilatory composition comprising an aqueous solution or emulsion (e.g. a paste or gel) of a depilatory agent, a film-forming polymer (such as poly(vinyl alcohol)), which can be water-soluble or insoluble, and optionally an alkali hair swelling accelerating agent or a filler. The composition of European Patent Application No. 0196896A2 is spread on an area of skin having hair, the coating is allowed to dry naturally or by treating with hot air and/or absorbing water into an absorbent sheet pressed onto the film; and the film is peeled off with the hairs embedded therein, optionally with use of a pressure-sensitive adhesive sheet placed on the film.

In using these depilatory compositions, it is advantageous to have compositions which are capable of forming films when they are applied to the skin. Compositions having film-forming properties have the advantages of facilitating the removal of the depilatory composition from the skin and the ease of disposal of the depilatory composition along with the digested hairs simply by peeling off the dried composition.

The components imparting the above-noted film-forming properties are generally high-molecular-weight polymers. To obtain substantial film-forming properties in depilatory compositions, it is not satisfactory to simply increase the concentration of these high-molecular-weight polymers in the depilatory compositions. Such an approach is indeed limited by the fact that these film-forming polymers excessively increase the viscosity of the finished product. The finished product becomes too thick; it is thus difficult to apply to the skin and therefore preventing the user from being able to properly apply the depilatory composition.

It would be most useful to formulate a depilatory composition with substantial film-forming properties, but in such a way that the viscosity of depilatory composition is low enough to properly apply to the skin as a thin film prior to forming a film.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a depilation composition and method for removing hair without causing pain. The depilation composition of the present invention comprises an aqueous solvent system containing a film-forming polymer compound and a depilatory agent wherein the depilation composition forms a peelable film after drying. The present invention also relates to a depilation method comprising coating the aforementioned depilatory composition onto an area of skin where hair is to be removed, drying the resulting coating to form a peelable film, and then peeling off the film. The depilation composition of the present invention uses a blend of fully and partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol).

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In some embodiments, methods and devices for the detection of an analyte in a body fluid using a plurality of species-specific antibodies are provided.

2. Description of the Related Art

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of analytes in body fluids such as saliva, urine or blood. These assays typically involve antigen-antibody reactions, synthetic conjugates comprising enzymatic, fluorescent, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most of these assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) specific for the selected analyte (e.g., antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of the antigen-antibody reaction product. Although some commercially available tests are designed to make a quantitative determination, in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative indication (e.g., positive/negative). Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, ovulation prediction and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Diagnostic assays should generally be very sensitive because of the often low concentrations of analytes of interest present in a test fluid. False positives can be problematic, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed that rely on the interaction between avidin and biotin-tagged antibodies. For example, in some commercially available pregnancy tests, an antibody-antigen sandwich complex comprising a colloidal gold-labeled anti-hCG antibody and an anti-hCG biotin-labeled antibody is used.

Because the above disclosed assays and methods enable the formation of antibody-antigen sandwich complexes in the liquid phase of an assay prior to the test line, they allow for more time for antigen recognition and binding to occur. These assays and methods therefore have greater sensitivity and discrimination for analytes of interest, resulting in greater reproducibility, sensitivity, and avoidance of false positives. Although such advances have improved these types of assays, further improvements in reliability and ease of manufacture are desirable.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides rapid, sensitive diagnostic devices and methods for detecting the presence of analytes in body fluids. In preferred embodiments, these methods and devices have high sensitivity and result in virtually no false positives, enabling reliable results even when used by untrained persons.

In preferred embodiments, a mixed-species lateral flow assay is provided, whereby an antibody-antigen sandwich complex is captured at a test result site thorough the recognition of a species-specific antibody in the sandwich complex. The antibodies in this antibody-antigen sandwich complex are derived from different species, allowing an antibody-antigen sandwich complex to be captured at the test line by an antibody that recognizes only one of the species-specific antibodies in the sandwich complex.

A device for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The device includes a release medium forming an upstream portion of the device; at least two primary antibodies that recognize the analyte and are derived from at least two different species, where at least two primary antibodies are located in or on the release medium; a capture medium forming a downstream portion of the device; and at least one secondary antibody specific for only one of the at least two primary antibodies, where the at least one secondary antibody is located in or on the capture medium.

In some embodiments, a first one of the at least two primary antibodies is conjugated to a label, and a second one of the at least two primary antibodies is unconjugated. In some embodiments, a first antibody of the at least one secondary antibody is specific for the species from which the second one of the at least two primary antibodies is derived. In some embodiments, a second secondary antibody is located in or on the capture medium that is specific for the species from which the first one of the at least two primary antibodies is derived. In some embodiments, the first and second ones of the at least two primary antibodies in or on the release medium are deposited in or on different locations of the release medium. In some embodiments, the first and second secondary antibodies in or on the capture medium are immobilized in or on different locations of the capture medium. In some embodiments, neither of the two primary antibodies are tagged with a capturable moiety or component such as biotin.

In another embodiment, a device for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The device includes a release medium comprising: a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member derived from a first species and a label, where the binding member is reactive with a first epitope of the analyte; and a capturable component derived from a second species, where the capturable component is reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a sandwich complex is formed comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte, and the capturable component; and a capture medium comprising a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component having specificity for the capturable component.

In another embodiment, a method of determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The method includes forming a sandwich complex comprising a first primary antibody derived from a first species, the analyte, and a second primary antibody derived from a second, different species; and capturing the sandwich complex with a secondary antibody specific for only one of the first and second different species.

In another embodiment, a method for determining the presence of an analyte in a liquid sample is provided. The method includes contacting the liquid sample with a release medium comprising: a labeled conjugate comprising a binding member derived from a first species, where the binding member is reactive with a first epitope of the analyte, and where the binding member is labeled with a detectable marker; and a capturable component derived from a second species, wherein the capturable component is reactive with a second epitope of the analyte, such that if the analyte is present in the sample, a complex comprising the labeled conjugate, the analyte and the capturable component is formed. The method further comprises contacting the liquid sample with a capture medium following exposure to the release medium, where the capture medium comprises a capture site for capturing the complex, the capture site having immobilized thereon a capture component having specificity for the capturable component; and determining whether the analyte is present in the liquid sample by detecting the presence of the detectable marker at the capture site.

"FIELD

This application is directed to comestibles and more particularly to rapidly dissolving comestible solids.

BACKGROUND

Mints and chewing gum are commonly used by consumers to freshen breath after meals, before personal interactions, and in other social situations. While these products are generally effective, there are many situations in which a consumer desires fresh breath but doesn't have time for a traditional tablet mint to dissolve or to chew gum long enough to achieve the desired level of freshness.

Mouthwash is a quick and effective way to freshen one's breath, but is generally not a suitable alternative in most cases for a variety of reasons. Another manner of providing a quicker way in which to achieve freshness has been the use of products generally known as breath strips, which are dissolvable films containing breath freshening ingredients. Breath strips have their own attendant drawbacks, including a propensity to stick to the roof of one's mouth and a mouthfeel that some consumers find unpleasant. Breath strips can sometimes also start to become sticky and/or dissolve on contact with the skin when removed from their container, particularly in humid weather.

These and other drawbacks are found in current breath fresheners and other products.

SUMMARY

What is needed is a comestible product that provides a tactile shape and mouthfeel consistent with a traditional tablet mint but that has a rapid dissolution that is more characteristic of a breath strip, to which exemplary embodiments are directed.

According to an exemplary embodiment, a rapidly dissolving comestible solid comprises a fondant of a super saturated solution of a bulk sweetener, a texturizing agent and, optionally, a hydrocolloid, wherein the fondant has a crystalline structure that does not exhibit cold flow at room temperature.

According to another exemplary embodiment, a method of making a rapidly dissolving comestible solid comprising mixing a bulk sweetener, a texturizing agent and a hydrocolloid in water to form a solution; cooking the solution to a temperature in the range of about 280° F. to about 300° F. to form a fondant; cooling the fondant to a temperature in the range of about 100° F. to about 150° F. to initiate crystal formation; extruding the fondant into a sheet; optionally applying indicia on the fondant; cutting the sheet of fondant; curing the fondant; and breaking the fondant into pieces.

An advantage of certain embodiments is that a comestible product is provided that has a tactile shape and mouthfeel consistent with a traditional tablet mint but that dissolves much more rapidly.

Another advantage is that the comestible product is made of a fondant that does not exhibit cold flow at room temperature, resulting in a stand-alone fondant product that does not require a shell or other support to retain its shape.

Still another advantage of certain embodiments is that the comestible products in accordance with exemplary embodiments can be manufactured according to either a batch or a continuous process.

These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments which, along with the drawings, illustrate by way of example the principles of the invention.

"CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION

This application is related to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/373,118 filed Aug. 12, 2010 and takes priority therefrom.

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed toward a detergent pouch with improved properties. In particular, at least two water-soluble films are sealed together to prepare the detergent pouch, which further contains a detergent composition. At least one flexibility-imparting agent is mixed within the detergent composition, or coated onto the detergent pouch. The flexibility-imparting agent provides the pouch with a flexibility that surprisingly minimizes leakage and cracking of the pouch under stress or unfavorable environmental conditions.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Pouch compositions are known in the art. These compositions have an advantage in that they are easy to dose, handle, transport and store. Recently, water-soluble pouches that contain cleaning or fabric care compositions have become popular.

Typically, the film material that is used to prepare water-soluble pouches is relatively fragile, thin, and must have a high water-reactivity, so that the pouches can release the contained product quickly and completely without leaving residue. However, when the pouches are under stresses from production, packing, transportation, or have been exposed to a moist environment, the thin film material often leads to a premature release of the contained product. Furthermore, when the film material is exposed to low temperature conditions, the pouches may become susceptible to cold shock cracking and failure. Pouched commercial products currently on the market often encounter the above-mentioned difficulties.

Meanwhile, the packaging of additives and the dispensing of compositions into the pouches can also be problematic. For example, additives such as auxiliary agents are typically incorporated within pouched cleaning products as moisture sinkers, but they are often contained separately from the detergent in the same unit dose (i.e. pouch), so that each component can retain its stability prior to consumer usage. Furthermore, it is important to have the detergent in a free-flow, solid particulate form prior to its dispensing into a unit dose, so that a filling machine that packages the pouch can meter and dispense a precise amount of the detergent. Precision in metering and packaging is critical to ensure safety for consumer handling, to reduce the environmental impact caused by excessive cleaning products, and to reduce material cost. Currently, industry practices known in the art have not optimized the packaging of additives with detergent in the same unit dose, so that that the pouch is made to minimize cracks and leakage, and that the detergent composition remains free flowing to be packaged.

Various methods and compositions are known in the prior art, to treat water-soluble films or to reduce moisture within water-soluble pouches. One example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,259,134 to Beckholt et al., which discloses a multi-compartmented pouch that contains one compartment that has a liquid composition. The liquid composition comprises a moisture regulator system made from a mixture of C2-C6monoalkylene polyol and C2-C3monoalkylene polyol. While another compartment has a hygroscopic powder to absorb the moisture.

Another example is U.S. Patent Application Number 2008/0020220 to Maurer et al., which discloses a PVOH film that has been pretreated exteriorly with a salt solution, to provide resistance to an accidental exposure to water.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,648,951 to Sharma et al, which discloses a multi-compartment pouch that contains a moisture-sensitive detergent active, and a humectant in a separate compartment to act as a moisture sink for the detergent.

Another example is U.S. Patent Application Number 2004/0182049 to Duffield, which discloses a PVOH film that has been pre-treated on both sides with a mixture of water, salt, and a water-soluble polymer prior to heat sealing. The film treatment increases the dissolution rate of the sealed area.

Another example is U.S. Pat. No. 7,201,819 to Wiedemann et al., which discloses the incorporation of a detergent in liquid, gel or paste form in a sealed package made of a film, wherein the film was pre-treated with glycerol and heat to avoid crumbling and wrinkle formation.

Finally, U.S. Patent Application 2009/0312220 to Boutoille et al. discloses the formation of a multi-compartmented PVA pouch, which contains a powder detergent therein. The PVA film has been pretreated with a wetting agent such as a plasticizer, to increase its malleability prior to pouching.

However, the above-mentioned references neither mention or address the technical problems that are related to pouch-handling under stress conditions, such as cold shock and cracking, or the difficulties of simultaneously flexing the pouch and maintaining the free-flow characteristic of the solid particulate detergent composition.

Thus, an objective of the present invention is to provide a flexible detergent pouch that contains a detergent composition therein. Another objective is to incorporate at least one flexibility-imparting agent within the detergent composition, so that the pouch subsequently becomes flexible and that the detergent composition remains free flowing. A further objective is to provide a detergent pouch whose flexibility does not decrease considerably with time.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

A detergent pouch is prepared by sealing at least two water-soluble polymeric films together, and further contains a detergent composition. The pouch has at least one flexibility-imparting agent that is coated onto the pouch. In another embodiment, if the detergent composition is a powder, the flexibility-imparting agent is mixed with the detergent composition. The flexibility-imparting agent makes the pouch surprisingly flexible to minimize leakage or cracks under stress or unfavorable environmental conditions.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND INTRODUCTION

The invention relates to new beverage products made from water steeped in a cocoa product or powder as well as combinations of this beverage with one or more functional or healthful ingredients, such as energy-producing, stimulating, immune-defense, heart health, detoxifying, muscle recuperating, cognition enhancing, or relaxing ingredients or supplements, for example. In general, the beverages contain a percentage of a cocoa water ingredient having beneficial or significant levels of cocoa antioxidants, optionally in combination with one or more vitamins, extracts, or nutriceuticals known in the art. The preferred fortified, refreshing, and/or energy-sustaining beverages of the invention can be produced as a ready-to-drink product, a concentrate, or as a mix or packet to produce a beverage. In preferred and advantageous embodiments, the beverages can be produced as a tea-type drink, a flavored or enhanced water drink, a juice cocktail-type drink, or an energy drink, and may optionally contain healthy ingredients in addition to the beneficial cocoa antioxidants and energy-producing ingredients. In other advantageous aspects, the methods of the invention permit effective filtering and processing of a cocoa/water mixture as well as options to reduce or substantially reduce the appearance of a surface fat ring, or cocoa fat ring, commonly present in the beverage containers of fat-containing compositions upon storage.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

A variety of cocoa beverages have been available. Almost exclusively, however, these products employ a milk or liquor base to dissolve the cocoa or maintain the cocoa solids in solution. Immediate examples include chocolate milk and cocoa or chocolate liqueurs. However, as more and more evidence shows the benefit of cocoa antioxidants or cocoa polyphenol compounds, a variety of food products with these compounds are desirable. The invention, in one aspect, addresses this desire by combining conventional tea steeping processes with cocoa polyphenol-containing products, concentrates or extracts to produce a refreshing cocoa beverage that optionally includes energizing and/or stimulating ingredients. In another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of filtering a mixture of a cocoa product and water or aqueous solution, as prior methods were prone to clogging and inefficiencies that prevent commercial production. In yet another aspect, the invention addresses the problem of fat rings commonly found in the container or at the surface of a beverage containing fat, such as the fat of cocoa butter.

Also, various energy drinks and infused or fortified teas have been marketed or suggested. However, due to at least the technical problems in using cocoa products in steeping processes, none of these tea products have been based upon cocoa as a basic ingredient. Furthermore, the desire for products containing cocoa antioxidants has increased, and therefore the art is in need of improved beverage products based upon cocoa.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to beverages made from steeped cocoa or what is referred to as “cocoa water,” which can be produced from cocoa products such as cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa powder, cacao nibs, or other cacao bean compositions. In one aspect, the invention relates to novel methods for making and the novel use of a steeped or brewed cocoa water as described herein. In a preferred embodiment the invention provides a method for producing a refreshing beverage containing cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, and which in certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or is a low calorie beverage. In another aspect, the cocoa water can be produced from a method of steeping cocoa products and filtering or removing solids or particulates, and then optionally combining this cocoa water with a juice or extract, such as a fruit, herbal, or vegetable juice or extract, that provides nutritional elements and reduces the astringency or bitterness commonly present in a cocoa composition. The cocoa water component itself provides a novel, refreshing base and contains cocoa flavor compounds and cocoa polyphenols, which can be the base material for a number of mixed beverage compositions or a primary beverage component. Combinations of coca water with fruit juices and/or extracts, or multiple fruit juices and/or extracts, are especially preferred in this regard, however the cocoa water can be mixed with sweeteners and water or tea or other beverage to produce a tea-type beverage also. In preferred embodiments, the cocoa water contains no detectable solid or particulate matter as determined by conventional beverage tasting methods, such as taste tests. In other preferred embodiments, the cocoa water contains no detectable particles over 50 microns in diameter, or has substantially no particles above 50 microns in diameter, or substantially no particles above 20 microns, or above 10 microns, or above 5 microns in diameter. Certain optional embodiments contain substantially zero calories and/or fat or can be a low calorie beverage. The beverage can be sealed in a container for commercial distribution and be shelf-stable for about 1 to about 9 months, or more than 9 months, or at least six months at room temperature. A variety of filtering, irradiating, heating, centrifugation, or treatment methods, or a combination of these, can be used to produce a beverage capable of stable storage over a period of time. Other similar or compatible methods known or available in the art can also be used.

The method for producing the cocoa water can include the use of purified or sterilized water at certain temperatures, or at a number of desired temperatures or ranges in temperature. However, any potable water or even flavored or carbonated water can be used. Filtering or purifying methods to remove insoluble components, or most of or substantially all of the insoluble components can be used, as known in the art. Preferred water includes carbon filtered water, deionized water, and/or water purified by reverse osmosis. In addition, aqueous solutions can be used, such as buffered aqueous solutions of citric acid, more preferably about 0.1 to about 1.0% citric acid, or about 0.4% to about 0.7%, or about 0.6% citric acid at about pH 4 or below, or between about pH 3 and pH 4. An aqueous solution prepared from water previously mixed with cocoa nibs can also be used. The use of this cocoa nib-treated water can provide additional cocoa flavoring, and the cocoa nib-treated water can also be free of fat and/or substantially free of calories. After steeping the water or aqueous solution with the cocoa product, the water is filtered or purified to produce a ready-to-drink beverage base referred to as cocoa water. An optional filtering or clarifying filter process to prepare an essentially colorless cocoa water can also be used in certain embodiments, and various beverage and juice filtration systems are available for this purpose. The cocoa water can optionally be concentrated by methods known in the art, and then used by adding water and optionally sweeteners and/or flavorings to produce a ready-to-drink product.

As noted, the cocoa water can be used as a base and one or more functional ingredients added to produce a final beverage or an ingredient for a food or beverage. Thus, the invention encompasses many different cocoa-based compositions and products and the methods for producing them.

In certain preferred embodiments, the base cocoa water composition is used with one or more fruit juices, which here encompasses fruit-based products and fruit juice concentrates and/or fruit extracts and/or essence of fruits or extracts. Any available fruit can be used for these juices, concentrates, or extracts, as well as any combination of two or more. However, preferred examples include: citrus fruits; orange; tangerine; cranberry; pomegranate; black currant; blueberry; grape; concord grape; white grape; pear; and apple. Additional fruits are listed below and throughout this document and its examples. Surprisingly, the combination of a fruit juice and the cocoa water provides a refreshing flavor that masks or blocks the sometimes bitter or astringent flavors in the cocoa water itself. Generally, the cocoa water concentrations in the final beverage are about 5% to about 10%, or about 10% to about 20%, or about 10% to about 60%, and the optional fruit juice is about 8% to about 40%. As noted below and throughout this document, many other ranges or specific beverages can be selected and used.

In other embodiments, a tea or tea product can, alternatively or additionally, be added to the cocoa water to produce a beverage. Various teas can be selected for use, including green tea, white tea, and any available tea blends. Similarly, elixirs, extracts and/or antioxidant preparations can be used as an additive in the beverages, such as extracts of green tea, white tea, cacao beans or nibs, grapeseed, blueberries, raspberries, black currant, cranberries, Japanese knotweed, or other antioxidant-containing food product, botanical, or other source.

In other energy-providing examples or in any of the examples discussed here, caffeine, theobromine, guarana, taurine, and other compounds can be present or added to the beverage.

In another aspect, the beverages include one or more flavors or flavor combinations or mixes, especially those compatible with beverages or what is known as beverage flavors. The flavors are compatible with the cocoa water base of the beverages and can be selected from those commonly used with cocoa and chocolate products, for example, and/or tea products. A concentrated plant extract, or essence, can also be used and refers to a concentrated plant extract containing its unique flavor and fragrance and capable of being used in a food, beverage, or for human consumption.

In another aspect, the invention comprises packets or dried beverage components for producing a beverage or composition of the invention. The packets can be similar to tea bags and can be submerged in water for steeping, as desired. The dried beverage components can be produced from conventional or available drying, spray drying, or concentrating processes of the art.

Preferably, the methods and products use natural cocoa or extracts that are not treated with alkaline, a process also known as “Dutching.” However, as noted, a variety of cocoa powders, cocoa extracts, cocoa concentrates, cocoa compositions, and cacao bean compositions are known and available to one of skill in the art and can be selected for use in any aspect of the invention. In addition, cocoa products or extracts with enhanced levels of cocoa polyphenols or cocoa flavanols, or extracts with additives, can also be selected for use. Defatted or non-fat cocoa products, such as defatted cocoa powder, can also be used alone or with other cocoa products. Furthermore, combinations of available cocoa powders, extracts, enhanced extracts, concentrates, extracts with additives can be selected and used for any aspect of the invention. The terms “cocoa powder,” “cocoa extract,” and “cocoa bean composition” for steeping, thus, can be any of a variety of products and combinations as well as specific combinations of the cacao bean-derived products noted in this disclosure.

In particularly preferred embodiments, the invention comprises beverages that contain efficacious flavanols, flavanoids, polyphenols, antioxidants, cocoa polyphenols and/or cocoa antioxidants and/or other cocoa-derived compounds or compositions. These beverages can be used in a healthy diet, for example a diet to improve cardiovascular conditions or prevent cardiovascular disease or maintain weight. Another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage composition that is a sugar-free and/or calorie-free cocoa beverage. Yet another aspect of the invention is to provide a cocoa beverage that is sugar-free and/or calorie-free and optionally contains other available or known supplements, active ingredients, appetite suppressing agents, and similar agents or ingredients, especially those also found in antioxidant-containing foods, herbs, teas, coffees, or food product ingredients. Further, the beverage or packet composition may also or in addition be combined with one or more other dietary nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, amino acids, etc., to provide a nutritional or dietary supplement. Any of these combinations of the invention can advantageously provide benefits to human health and capture additional beneficial effects. Also, all of the ingredients or combinations may be combined with appropriate stabilizers, emulsifiers, preservatives, binders, carageenans, and other edible or ingestible compounds known to one of skill in the art in the industry to produce a packet or beverage.

In addition, the invention includes methods of selecting appropriate combinations of cocoa products, conditions, manufacturing steps, or additives or ingredients to produce a shelf-stable product, and particularly a product capable of being stored as a ready-to-drink beverage in a container for at least one month at room temperature, or at least two months at room temperature, or at least three months at room temperature, or at least six months at room temperature. In a similar aspect, the invention includes methods to produce a cocoa water composition, and the compositions themselves, whereby the propensity to form a fat ring on a storage container of the cocoa water or a final product is substantially reduced or minimized. In particular, the invention includes the use of acidifying conditions or low pH buffering additives, such as citric acid, lactic acid and/or phosphoric acid compounds or combinations, used at one or more steps in the production process. Preferably, a pH of about 3.5 or below can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring on the container after storage. Filtration steps, filter aids, centrifugation steps, and settling time, all at selected or different temperatures, can substantially reduce the appearance of a fat ring. Additionally, the use of low fat cocoa powder, with about 1.2% fat, can reduce the appearance of a fat ring. In general, low fat cocoa powder contains lees than 10% cocoa butter, and defatted cocoa powder contains less than 2% cocoa butter. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low in fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The use of defatted cocoa powder combined with an acid additive is one preferred method for reducing the fat ring, but any cocoa powder, or cocoa product, that is defatted or low fat can be used alone or in combination with other cocoa products. The products and the methods of the invention can, in any embodiment, also include aseptic processing, for example treatments of the water or aqueous solution, the cocoa product-water mixture, and/or the final steeped product. Beverage emulsifiers, beverage stabilizers, weighting agents, thickeners can also be added, and a preferred group is polysorbates, carrageenans, Tween 60, Tween 80, and gum arabic. Additional methods provide for selecting particular cocoa compositions, conditions for steeping, water, and other optional ingredients to optimize the taste, mouthfeel, or acidity of the ready-to-drink product.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to cleaning products, and more particularly to unit dose cleaning products for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Peroxide-based bleaching agents (e.g., hydrogen peroxide, sodium percarbonate, sodium persulfate, sodium perphosphate, urea peroxide, and sodium perborate) act as effective oxidizers for whitening substrates, removing stains, and disinfecting surfaces. Peroxide-based bleaching agents promote a bleaching effect on organic materials and thus are used with detergents in cleaning compositions, and are also used for bleaching textiles and paper, among other applications. The bleaching effect is particularly strong in washing and cleaning processes.

Generally, to clean a soiled substrate such as clothing, the substrate is treated with hydrogen peroxide or a substance capable of generating perhydroxyl ions (HOO—), such as inorganic or organic peroxides as exemplified above. Upon contact with the surface of the soiled substrate, the peroxide effectively removes common stains such as coffee or wine, while disinfecting the surface. Compared to more volatile hypochlorite-based bleaches, peroxide-based bleaching agents exhibit environmental benefits including enhanced safety and reduced pollution. However, peroxide-based bleaching agents do not perform at the same level of cleaning efficacy as hypochlorite-based bleaches.

Peroxide bleach activating agents, or bleach activators, such as, for example, acyl compounds (e.g., tetraacetylethylenediamene (TAED)) and ester compounds (e.g., isononanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (ISONOBS) and nonanoyloxybenzene-sulfonate (NOBS)), and the like, can be added to boost activity of peroxide-based bleaching agents. It has been found that the level of peroxide bleaching activity typically generated at 95° C. by peroxide alone can be achieved at 60° C. with the addition of bleach activators. The bleach activator reacts in the presence of the peroxide-based bleaching agent to generate peracetic acid, which is a more potent oxidizer than hydrogen peroxide.

Liquid formulations containing such bleach activators have met limited consumer success due to a lack of sufficient stability. When the liquid compositions are formulated with dissolved peroxide compounds, the resulting composition is especially unstable, and thus, prone to rapid loss of bleaching efficacy. To prolong stability, the cleaning composition containing peroxide and bleach activator is typically packaged with the actives physically segregated or in an anhydrous environment. This can be achieved by dispersing the actives either in a suspension segregating the peroxide and bleach activator in different liquid phases or blending them in a dry powder form.

Powder and dual-phase liquid formulations are generally less desirable especially for consumer use as compared to other forms of cleaning compositions. Even when maintained in an anhydrous environment (i.e., powder and dual-phase liquid), the bleach activator can still react with the peroxide. Over time, the bleach activator and peroxide degrade leading to reduced efficacy.

Accordingly, there is a need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent that is formulated to alleviate the limitations described above and which prevents premature degradation of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent. There is a further need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent comprising a cleaning composition of the peroxide-based bleaching agent and a peroxide bleach activating agent, having improved stability over time, while enhancing convenience and ease of use for the consumer. There is also a need for a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent that promotes cleaning of substrates in a more environmentally-friendly manner.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent. The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention is specifically formulated for enhanced cleaning (bleaching) activity, while substantially improving peroxide stability and therefore providing an extended shelf-life. The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention utilizes a combination of a peroxide-containing bleaching agent and a peroxide bleach activating agent for enhanced bleaching activity, formulated for improved stability over time with minimal loss of efficacy during storage. The configuration of the unit dose cleaning product also provides a vehicle to delay immediate release of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent until the product is completely dispersed in an aqueous environment. This delay substantially minimizes premature interaction between the peroxide-containing bleaching agent and the peroxide bleach activating agent, thereby maximizing cleaning efficacy.

The unit dose cleaning product of the present invention is especially formulated for cleaning soiled substrates, such as, for example, laundry and dishware. The unit dose cleaning product is designed to provide a self-contained single-dose package that permits the consumer to dispense the product without the need to measure the amount of the active agent. In this manner, the unit dose cleaning product of the present invention enhances ease of use and dispensing for reduced waste, and at least minimizes skin contact with potentially irritating ingredients.

In particular, the unit dose cleaning product of the present invention includes a cleaning composition of a peroxide-containing bleaching agent component comprising a peroxide-containing bleaching agent, preferably in the form of anhydrous particles encapsulated in a first at least partially water soluble material. The cleaning composition also contains a peroxide bleach activating agent component containing a peroxide bleach activating agent, preferably in the form of a non-aqueous liquid. A pouch comprising a second at least partially water soluble material enclosing the cleaning composition is also provided. The first at least partially water soluble material of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component has a substantially longer dissolution time than the second at least partially water soluble material of the pouch. Optionally, the cleaning composition of the present unit dose cleaning product further includes one or more surfactants, detergents and enzymes, each in amounts effective for promoting cleaning of soiled substrates.

As used herein, the term “encapsulate” is used in its customary and ordinary sense where the first at least partially water soluble material provides a barrier which protects the material contained therein (the peroxide-containing bleaching agent) until the first at least partially water soluble material begins to dissolve.

The term “enclosing” refers to the second at least partially water soluble material forming a pouch which protects the contents of the cleaning composition (including the encapsulated peroxide-containing bleaching agent) until the second at least partially water soluble material begins to dissolve.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a unit dose cleaning product for delivering a peroxide-containing bleaching agent, comprising:

a peroxide-containing bleaching agent component comprising a peroxide-containing bleaching agent and a first at least partially water soluble material encapsulating the peroxide-containing bleaching agent;

a peroxide bleach activating agent component comprising a peroxide bleach activating agent, and having the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component dispersed therein forming a cleaning composition; and

a pouch comprising a second at least partially water soluble material enclosing the cleaning composition, wherein the first at least partially water soluble material of the peroxide-containing bleaching agent component exhibits a substantially longer dissolution time than the second at least partially water soluble material of the pouch. Optionally, the peroxide bleach activating agent is in the form of a non-aqueous liquid.

In another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of cleaning soiled substrates, comprising:

dissolving the unit dose cleaning product described above in water to form a cleaning solution; and

contacting the cleaning solution with the soiled substrates to remove soils therefrom.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to chromatography methods useful in identifying, purifying, and quantifying multiple oligomeric flavanol compounds. More specifically, and in one aspect, the invention relates to the use of liquid-liquid partition chromatography with extracts and samples fromTheobroma cacaobeans. In another aspect, the invention relates to a more efficient or simultaneous purification of multiple procyanidins or flavanol oligomers from a sample.

RELEVANCE OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART

Flavan-3-ol derivatives, such as catechins and procyanidin polymers, are prevalent antioxidant compounds ofTheobroma cacaoseeds or beans or nibs. Numerous reports have discussed the potential benefits of these compounds on human health and wellbeing. However, due to at least the complexity of their source from plant material, methods of purification, identification and quantification of specific polymers and oligomers of these compounds have been difficult to achieve in reliable and efficient ways. Generally, for food products and for cocoa products in particular, functional assays such as ORAC have been used to refer to the level of these compounds present. Commercial standards for comparison of many cocoa-derived oligomers are not available and thus limit the ability to produce reliable quantitative methods for isolation.

Centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) is a relatively new and unique method of liquid-liquid partition chromatography. CPC enables the separation of components with nearly identical partition ratios and can be performed without the aid of a solid support.

CPC can be categorized in several ways. First, CPC is a type of countercurrent chromatography, which is an automated liquid-liquid extraction process permitting hundreds of automatic successive extractions. CPC is also a type of liquid-liquid partition chromatography, a technique involving a liquid stationary phase and a liquid mobile phase. The solute equilibrates between the stationary and mobile liquids. Finally, CPC utilizes a centrifugal force from a spinning rotor to effectively pump solutes through a column region and separate compounds.

CPC is unique because no solid support is used for the stationary phase. Instead, the liquid stationary phase is retained in a chamber by a combination of centrifugal force, the geometry, and the density difference between two liquid phases. The CPC apparatus consists of a rotor that employs a particular mode of motion. The rotor contains one or more chambers in which channels are engraved. The less dense stationary phase remains in the column because of the centrifugal force created by the spinning rotor. Consequently, the mobile phase is able to pass through the stationary phase.

When a mixture of components is introduced into the mobile phase of the CPC chamber, it distributes according to the individual components' distribution coefficients. The centrifugal force applied promotes the retention of the stationary phase against a continuous flow of mobile phase. The mobile phase flow enables the two phases to interact sufficiently for partition to occur, resulting in chromatographic separation.

The degree of separation in centrifugal partition chromatography depends primarily on the partition coefficient of the solute between the two solvent phases. Other important parameters in the separation process include mass transfer coefficients, flow rate, rotational frequency, and the identity of the two phases. A variety of the two-phase systems are possible using the CPC column. Both organic and aqueous systems are feasible. In fact, using CPC chromatography, aqueous two-phase systems can be used for separation. And, importantly, CPC can be used to separate racemic mixtures into chirally pure compounds.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The invention, in one aspect, satisfies a need for efficient and reliable isolation methods for catechin compounds and oligomers that has intriguing commercial advantages on several fronts. Initially, it provides the art with an avenue to isolate individual procyanidin compounds that is straightforward and cost-effective. This allows one to use these isolated compounds in clinical studies. In addition, the methods allow one to quantitate multiple procyanidin oligomers more efficiently, and within the same sample or experiment. Similarly, by providing a standardized protocol for treating cocoa-containing samples and using CPC methods for purification or analysis, the invention potentially allows commercial or standardized ways to record levels of specific procyanidin compounds or subsets of specific procyanidin compounds that may be present in food ingredients or food products. In addition, the invention allows for the isolation of specific chiral-active oligomers from those present in cocoa or plant sources, for example.

Procyanidins are very common constituents of plants and are believed to be the second most common class of natural phenolic substances found in nature, after lignans. Because they are well represented in the Western diet, such as in cocoa, apples, and many berries, there is a growing interest in determining their pharmacological properties and significance as dietary antioxidants. Responding to these demands, the present invention involves a novel and advantageous approach to the preparative fractionation of cocoa procyanidins according to their degree of polymerization (DP) by applying a liquid-liquid (no solid support) chromatography, such as with a method known as Fast Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (FCPC) with commercialized rotors (for example, Kromaton, Annonay, France). The liquid-liquid system avoids the common problems in purifying flavonoids and flavan-3-ols, as they are prone to adhere to solid supports. In addition, as it is known that the chirality of cocoa flan-3-ols and flavanols effects their bioavailability and that distinct chiral species have differing biological activity, the methods can be used to isolate specific chiral compounds and subsets of chiral compounds from plants and cocoa in particular. Current methods involving a chiral HPLC column can be used to separate enantiomeric forms, but the time per run is in excess of an hour with minimal ability to scale up the process for larger quantities. Thus, CPC and FCPC as described here offers not only the ability to separate various enantiomeric forms but the scalability to isolate sufficient amounts on a cost effective basis so that they can be used in clinical and consumer studies.

In an experiment optimized for the best separation of procyanidin DP families between 4 and 12, one can employ a solvent system consisting of ethyl acetate-ethanol-water (6:1:5) in an ascending mode, wherein the mobile phase is the upper phase in each of the columns. However, other ratios of these solvents, as well as other, similar solvents as discussed herein, can be selected and used and one such example is ethyl acetate:ethanol:water (8:1:2). The procyanidin oligomers (DP2 to DP14) eluted with the mobile phase in an order of increasing DP, which is associated with an increasing polarity. The separation of bands between DP5 and DP9 was particularly impressive and advantageous in a context of the best preparative approaches reported for these compounds to date. The fractionation can be monitored by a normal phase HPLC analysis on a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) column as well as by a C18 Reverse Phase (RP) column. To confirm and supplement this data, spectroscopic mass analysis of selected fractions by MALDI-TOF can be used. The Reverse Phase HPLC analysis reveals that in each DP family, the dominant peaks represented the linear epicatechin (4β-8) oligomers. However, using the FCPC fractionation approach, higher procyanidin oligomers can be separated and in advantageous quantities, such as those quantities required for evaluation of clinical or biological properties.

Thus, in one aspect, the invention relates to a scalable method for the bulk isolation and purification of cocoa procyanidin oligomers of varying length including DP2 through DP14, or subsets within this range of DP levels, such as DP2 through DP12 or DP 4 to DP12, as well as any specific procyanidin oligomer that may be present in plant and cocoa samples, including distinct or specific chiral species of the oligomeric compounds present in a fraction containing multiple oligomeric forms of a certain DP length. The methods and compositions of the invention are not limited to the oligomeric range DP2 to DP14, but this range is preferred. Thus, species higher than DP14 can be isolated from the methods of the invention.

In one aspect of the liquid-liquid partition chromatography methods of the invention, the invention includes a method of purifying at least one procyanidin oligomer compound from a cocoa-containing sample by optionally first defatting a cocoa-containing sample. The defatting step can comprise an extraction with a solvent comprising one or more of an alcoholic solvent, an aqueous solvent, or both an alcoholic and aqueous solvent. In other examples, the defatting step can be required. The examples below refer to various solvents that can be used. Other defatting methods or extractions can be used, such as extraction with hexane or acetone and other organic solvent extractions, as well as supercritical fluid extraction methods available in the art.

A solvent system of a mobile phase lipophillic solvent, a bridging solvent of one of more alcohols, and a stationary phase aqueous solvent can be selected for the intended or expected composition of the sample. The stationary and mobile phases can be reversed from those just stated or from those stated anywhere in this specification. In one example, the cocoa-derived samples (or extract) containing procyanidins DP3 to DP12 (or DP4 to DP12) can employ water or an aqueous solvent as the stationary phase solvent and ethyl acetate as the mobile phase solvent. However, the stationary and mobile phases can also be reversed, so that the stationary phase is ethyl acetate. The cocoa-containing sample is mixed with the mobile and stationary phase solvents and then added to a reservoir in a rotor. The rotor is prepared with multiple interconnected mixing chambers within it, each mixing chamber filled with or containing the stationary phase aqueous solvent. The cocoa-containing sample in the reservoir of the rotor enters one end of the mixing chambers and when the rotor is run or centrifugal force applied, the force allows the cocoa-containing sample to flow through multiple mixing chambers with the mobile phase solvent. As the components of the sample flow through the solvent, the components separate and exit at another end of the mixing chamber. Purified samples can then be collected. This method economically and quickly purifies one procyanidin oligomer in the exemplary range from DP3 to DP12, for example, from the other oligomers of differing DP.

A bridging solvent can be used and selected from those with a polarity between the polarities of the two phases (stationary and mobile). The bridging solvent dissolves partially in one phase as well as partially in the other. Thus, it can be used to modify the properties of both phases. For example, if an alcohol is used as a bridging solvent, the hydrophobic ethyl acetate solvent becomes more polar because it contains some alcohol. Also, the aqueous phase with bridging solvent alcohol becomes more lipophillic and a different range of organic substances can then dissolve in it. Without a bridging solvent, the polarities of the two phases are typically very pronounced such that some components of the sample are almost exclusively found in one or the other phase. This is not an ideal situation for a purification or separation because the components which are in the hydrophobic phase do not partition into the aqueous phase and thus would not be retained during a CPC run.

Accordingly, a bridging solvent can be selected that is preferably one of, or a mixture of one or more of, ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, and butanol. In general, the bridging solvent can be a C1 to C4 alcohol. The pH constraints imposed by solid supports such as silica and others are not a consideration with CPC. Thus, centrifugal partition chromatographic or liquid-liquid separations may be performed at virtually any pH, and the bridging solvent can also be used with a pH adjusted solvent for this purpose. For example, low pH can be used to preserve procyanidin content during the procedures, such as below pH 6 or at or below pH 4. In particular, the solvents and solutions that contact the procyanidin oligomers can optionally or preferably be maintained between about pH 3 to about pH 6 with an organic acid, with acetic acid being a preferred organic acid. Maintaining this pH range can preserve the levels of procyanidins present during the isolation process.

Purification with the methods of the invention can be combined with one or more additional or supplemental conventional purification procedures, such as solid phase chromatography or HPLC. Also, the method can avoid the use of additional purification procedures, like HPLC. In addition, the methods of the invention can be used to determine the amount of a specific procyanidin oligomer that is present in a particular cocoa sample. Exemplary methods for determining amounts and concentrations include spectroscopy, comparison to standards, and mass spectrometry. Thus, the methods can be used as a quantitative analysis of the procyanidin content of a sample.

As stated, the preferred sample is a cocoa-derived sample, but other plant-based materials can be used, such as apple, grapeseed, grape, pine bark, berries, cinnamon, pomegranate, acai, and other plants known to contain procyanidins or condensed tannins, or samples with detectable or high levels of these or procyanidin compounds. Where the method employs a cocoa-containing or cocoa-derived sample, it can be selected from one or more of chocolate liquor, cocoa powder, cocoa kibble, a cocoa extract, low fat cocoa powder, defatted cocoa powder, and non fat cocoa solids, for example.

The invention also includes a substantially purified procyanidin oligomer and/or a substantially purified chiral oligomer or subsets of specific and/or chiral compounds. For example, a purified composition of one or more procyanidin oligomers DP3 to DP12 that was derived from a cocoa-containing sample can obtained by the methods described here. Also, the purified composition can substantially consist of a single procyanidin oligomer selected from DP4 to DP12, meaning the sample primarily contains only one oligomer or procyanidin when analyzed by HPLC.

In preferred examples, the biphasic solvent mixture is a mixture of ethyl acetate, ethanol, and water, and in most preferred examples these solvents are present at a ratio of 6:1:5 respectively. Multiple FCPC mixing chambers or columns can be used, and the polarity of the biphasic solvent mixture can increase from a first chamber used to the last used. Effectively, and as shown in the data ofFIG. 2, the number of chambers used and the FCPC conditions selected are capable of resolving separate bands for at least each of DP5 through DP9 procyanidin oligomers, or each of DP3 to DP12, or each of DP4 to DP12, or each of DP 4 to DP10, for example.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The field of the present invention relates generally to condoms, and more specifically to condoms having a lubricant system which imparts warmth, or provides a warming effect or sensation upon use.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

A variety of lubrication systems for condoms are disclosed in the art. Some of the lubricants employed are sold or supplied separately as so-called personal lubricants, while others are applied to condoms prior to packaging. Some lubricants have particular physiological effects. For example, Heidenfelder (U.S. Pat. No. 4,840,188) discloses the coating of the interior surface of a condom with a local anesthetic such as benzocaine to provide desensitization.

The instant invention is directed to a condom together with a lubricant which provides a warming effect or sensation upon use. This effect is in contrast to the cooling sensation imparted by conventional lubricants.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention generally provides a condom in combination with a lubricant composition comprising one or more glycols. Such glycols, provided they are present in an environment relatively free from unbound water, will warm upon contact with compositions containing unbound water. Such warming of glycol based condom lubricants results in a warming sensation during condom use.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device, U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention relates to novel liquid cleaning detergent compositions containing peroxide and a catalyst.

BACKGROUND

Hydrogen peroxide solutions have been used for many years for a variety of purposes, including bleaching, disinfecting, and cleaning a variety of things and surfaces ranging from skin, hair, and mucous membranes to contact lenses to household and industrial surfaces and instruments. In particular, peroxide-containing bleaching agents have long been used in washing and cleaning processes. When soiled clothing is contacted with such bleaching compositions, usually by washing the soiled clothing in the presence of the bleaching composition at the boil, the bleaching agent functions to remove such common domestic stains as tea, coffee, fruit and wine stains from clothing.

Traditionally, to clean a substrate such as clothing, the substrate is subjected to hydrogen peroxide, or to substances which can generate hydroperoxyl radicals, such as inorganic or organic peroxides. Generally, these peroxide systems must be activated in order to work properly. One method of activating the system is to employ wash temperatures of 60° C. or higher, but it is often advantageous to wash laundry in cold water (e.g., temperatures from about 2-24° C.). Washing in cold water generally conserves energy and therefore costs less money than washing in warm water. Other advantages include potentially less damage to clothes. However, if the washing temperature is reduced to below 60° C., the efficacy of the peroxides in the bleaching agent is correspondingly reduced.

In order to avoid having to employ wash temperatures of 60° C. or higher, it is well-known that certain heavy metals, or complexes thereof, function to catalyze the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, or of compounds which are capable of liberating hydrogen peroxide, in order to render the peroxide compound effective at temperatures below 60° C. Various transition metal ions added in the form of suitable salts, and coordination compounds containing such cations, are known to activate hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In that manner, by using certain heavy metals as catalysts, it is possible for the bleaching effect (which is unsatisfactory at lower temperatures) of H2O2, or precursors that release H2O2and of other peroxo compounds, to be increased.

In terms of H2O2activation having effective bleaching action, mononuclear and polynuclear variants of manganese complexes having various ligands, especially 1,4,7-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane and optionally oxygen-containing bridging ligands, are currently regarded as being especially effective. Such catalysts are adequately stable under practical conditions and, with Mnn+, contain an ecologically acceptable metal cation, but their use is unfortunately associated with considerable damage to dyes and fibres.

For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,511, there is described the activation of a peroxy compound by a complex formed from a transition metal (Mn, Co, Fe or Cu) and a non-(macro)cyclic ligand, preferably 2,2-bispyridylamine or 2,2-bispyridylmethane.

Moreover, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,114,606, there is disclosed a manganese complex, for use as a bleach catalyst for a peroxy compound, which is a water-soluble complex of manganese II, III or IV, or mixtures thereof, with a ligand which is a non-carboxylate polyhydroxy compound, having at least three consecutive C—OH groups in its molecular structure, preferably sorbitol.

The incorporation of some ingredients into detergent compositions is problematic. Detergent compositions are often stored for some time and interactions may occur between active components such that a reduction in the amount of the active component may result. This can be particularly problematic in the presence of moisture.

Many ways of protecting and delivering sensitive, highly active, low dosage detergent components have been suggested. In EP-A-0072166, EP-A-0124341, EP-A-224952 and WO 95/06710, heavy metal complexes are incorporated into detergent compositions in agglomerated or aggregate form in order to improve storage stability. In EP-A-170346, bleach catalysts are adsorbed onto solid silicon supports. In EP-A-141 470, heavy metal ion catalysts are protected by selecting specific ligands and then providing a protective coating; in EP-A-141472, micronised coatings are described. In EP-A-544 440, gelled polymers are used; in WO 95/33817, wax encapsulation is used requiring a surfactant in the particle. Unfortunately, coating methods are costly and coated/encapsulated particles are vulnerable to fissures or incomplete coatings leading to loss of the active component(s) in the particle.

Problems arise in the addition to the formulation or incorporation of a bleaching (agent) components when the composition is a liquid, particularly aqueous washing and cleaning agents that are enjoying an increased popularity due to their positive product properties, such as a better and faster solubility and practicality. Due to the decomposition reactions or hydrolysis and incompatibilities towards other constituents of the washing agent formulation, such as, e.g., enzymes or surfactants, the added bleaching agents often lose their activity already on storage or even during product utilization. An adverse consequence resulting from this is that the washing performance—particularly the bleaching power—of the washing agent formulation noticeably deteriorates, such that bleachable stains in particular can no longer be satisfactorily removed.

Bleaching agents, such as for example perborates or percarbonates, which are usually used in solid washing agent formulations, are extremely moisture sensitive, with the result that they often lose their bleaching power within a few days in a liquid and particularly aqueous washing or cleaning agents, due to the loss of active oxygen.

Decomposition of hydrogen peroxide caused by catalytically active substances, such as metal ions, is extremely difficult to prevent. For products that contain hydrogen peroxide to be effective, a substantial proportion of the hydrogen peroxide must survive between manufacture and use. In addition, decomposition produces oxygen gas, which could overpressure the container and cause it to rupture during storage or shipping. Examples of such compositions are given, for example, in Kott, U.S. Pat. No. 5,641,739; Scialla, U.S. Pat. No. 5,559,090; Monticello, U.S. Pat. No. 6,106,774; and Kandathil, U.S. Pat. No. 4,238,192.

Liquid detergent compositions offer several advantages over solid compositions. For example, liquid compositions are easier to measure and dispense. Additionally, liquid compositions are especially useful for direct application to heavily soiled areas on fabrics, after which the pre-treated fabrics can be placed in an aqueous bath for laundering in the ordinary manner.

Unfortunately, unless very stringent conditions are met, hydrogen peroxide solutions begin to decompose into O2gas and water within an extremely short time. Typical hydrogen peroxide solutions in use for these purposes are in the range of from about 0.5 to about 6% by weight of hydrogen peroxide in water. The rate at which such dilute hydrogen peroxide solutions decompose will, of course, be dependent upon such factors as pH and the presence of trace amounts of various metal impurities, such as copper or chromium, which may act to catalytically decompose the same. Moreover, at moderately elevated temperatures, the rate of decomposition of such dilute aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutions is greatly accelerated. Hence, hydrogen peroxide solutions which have been stabilized against peroxide breakdown are in very great demand.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The objective of this invention is to develop a stable, liquid bleach composition that contains a peroxide-based bleaching agent, water, and a metal catalyst. The present invention contains a polyol as a secondary solvent to promote peroxide stability in the presence of a catalyst.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to a process for the production of a non-compressible comestible product comprising xylitol and the comestible product comprising xylitol produced therefrom.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Xylitol is a naturally occurring five carbon sugar alcohol. It occurs naturally in many fruits and vegetables and is produced by the human body during normal metabolism. It is a sweet crystalline product, white in color, odorless and soluble in water. In crystalline form, it quickly dissolves in the mouth. It has a negative heat of dissolution, and thereby produces an agreeable refreshing or cooling effect in the mouth.

In addition to its cooling effect, xylitol has interesting sweetening qualities. If one takes sucrose as a reference point, and attributes to it a sweetening value of 1, xylitol is found to have a sweetness of the same order. Thus, xylitol is a sugar substitute. In fact, it has the same sweetness and bulk as sucrose with one third fewer calories (2.4 calories per gram) and no unpleasant after taste. It is currently approved around the world for use in foods, pharmaceuticals and oral hygiene products. For example, xylitol has been widely used in confectionery, baking products, cereals, desserts, jams, beverages, chocolate, chewing gum, gumdrops, and ice cream to name just a few products. It has also been used in the production of oral hygiene products, such as toothpaste and in pharmaceutical products. In addition, it is used as a sucrose substitute placed in foods for consumption by people with diabetes.

Further, xylitol has an interesting property for dental health, in which it differs from other known polyols. It is, in fact, anti-cariogenic, i.e., it cannot serve as a substrate for bacteria present in the mouth cavity. Moreover, it also plays a role in preventing dental caries. It inhibits the growth ofStreptococcus Mutans, the primary bacteria associated with dental caries. Recent interest has increased in xylitol-containing candies because xylitol has been shown to promote remineralization of teeth and damaged tooth enamel. It has also been found that regular use of xylitol can inhibit the transfer of cariogenicStreptococcus Mutansbacteria from mothers to their newborn children. Studies have shown that mothers are the primary source of infection ofStreptococcusin the mouths of newborns and that prevention or delaying colonization by these bacteria leads to significant reduction in tooth decay later in life. In addition, xylitol reduces plaque accumulation and inhibits plaque regrowth.

Further, it also increases salivary flow. Saliva helps clean and protect teeth from decay and this plays a role in repairing the damage caused in the early state of the decay process.

Thus, it is important to have a method of producing products comprising xylitol for use in these various applications.

One such product is a hard candy comprised of xylitol. However, producing a hard candy of xylitol is challenging. It is difficult for xylitol to be made into a hard candy free of crystals because its glass transition is below 32 F (0 C) and at normal household conditions, it would exist as a liquid, although because of its instability, would slowly transform to a few large crystals grown loosely together. Furthermore, as a crystal, it does not compact well.

In addition, in preparing hard candies comprising xylitol, the xylitol is traditionally melted completely to form a molten mass. The molten mass is mechanically agitated or seeded with xylitol crystals to cause crystallization. The resultant seeded mass is then combined in a layered format, wherein an isomalt base is first deposited, then followed by a xylitol layer or the xylitol is codeposited with isomalt in a mold to produce hard candy.

The problem often encountered in this process is that the final product is usually hygroscopic and sticky. Further, the molten mass often manages to crystallize in the machinery and/or equipment, thereby clogging the machinery and/or equipment. Further, once the seed crystals have been added, the viscosity of the seeded molten mass is very difficult to control. Moreover, the product is very temperature sensitive. The seeded mass thickens and crystallizes rapidly if the temperature falls below the melting point of xylitol, and on the other hand, thins, due to melting of the seed crystals if the temperature is raised above the melting point. As a consequence, the viscosity and density of the seeded mass tends to vary upon prolonged exposure to a molten state which is particularly undesirable in deposited hard candy manufacturing lines where any inconsistency of the seeded mass leads to inconsistent piece weight and potential equipment failure. Further, the resultant candy is quite hard, and difficult to bite through.

The present inventors were investigating a new method for producing a hard candy comprising xylitol by modifying the methodology of the prior art. They began preparing the hard candy in a scraped surface heat exchanger, maintaining the temperature at or above the melting point of xylitol. Even though they initially worked with a complete melt, when they lowered the temperature in the scraped surface heat exchanger below the melting point of xylitol, crystals of xylitol began to form in the scraped surface heat exchanger and begin to clog the machine. Once the xylitol recrystallized, it became extremely difficult to work with. The inventors also noted that the product was hard and was not easily bitten into. Moreover, the inventors have confirmed that if the temperature of the emitted scraped surface heat exchanger was too hot, such material was difficult to handle and the product obtained was undesirable.

However, the inventors found that if the xylitol was not completely melted in an extruder, the resulting product was different and was much softer than the product comprising xylitol obtained from completely melting the solid and recrystallizing the melted solid in a scraped surface heat exchanger. Further, in the method found by the present inventors, since the xylitol solid was not being recrystallized, the extruder was no longer getting clogged.

The present invention thus describes this process which overcomes the problems enumerated above and provides a product which has a high flavor impact and a strong cooling sensation. Yet, at the same time, the product that is produced is a soft product that can be easily bitten through.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention, in one embodiment, is directed to a method of producing a solid non-compressible comestible product comprising xylitol, said method comprising:(a) subjecting a composition comprising solid xylitol in an amount ranging from about 60% up to and including 100% by weight to extrusion treatment in an extrusion apparatus under conditions sufficient to partially melt the xylitol in the composition to form a slurry and maintain the composition as a slurry as it passes through and exits the extrusion apparatus,(b) forming the extruded product from step (a) into a desired shape and(c) cooling the product of (b) to form a solid.

The present invention is also directed to the product of the process described hereinabove. In an embodiment, it is a comestible comprising from about 60% to about 100% xylitol, having irregularly shaped crystals, and which, when molded into a yertz shape having a base width of 8.20 mm, a base length of 13.26 mm, a height of 8.71 mm, an angle of 10% between the vertical and the side and having 0.25 mm radius fillet and weighing about 0.75 grams, has a piece break pressure of less than about 110 MPa and a dissolution rate from about 200 to about 400 seconds, said comestible having a moisture content of less than about 1% by weight of the composition, said comestible being substantially free of monosaccharides and disaccharides and maltodextrin having a DE (dextrose equivalent) of less than 20 and sugar alcohols other than xylitol.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to diagnostic assays for analytes in a fluid sample. In particular, the invention relates to devices, methods, and test kits for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid.

Description of the Related Art

Detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine samples is routinely used to determine a woman's pregnant/non-pregnant status. Traditional one-step pregnancy test devices detect hCG by utilizing a double antibody system in a lateral flow format resulting in a “sandwich” complex of hCG, a capture antibody and a labeled antibody, which is captured at a specific detection area on a test strip. A digital version of the pregnancy test device consists of an opto-electronic reader powered by an internal battery that measures the absorbance/reflectance of the label particles specifically captured at the detection area of the test strip and automatically subtracts any non-specific background color from an adjacent area of the test strip that is outside the detection area. The adjusted measurement of absorbance/reflectance of accumulated label particles at the detection area is then compared to a preset threshold value and further processed into a clearly read YES+/PREGNANT or NO−/NOT PREGNANT digital result on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.

Although electronic readers provide the added convenience of eliminating the end-user step of interpreting the results of the test, a step required in traditional lateral flow devices, there is room for improvements. For an electronic reader system that incorporates a lateral flow test strip, one of the many challenges in increasing the detection sensitivity is the unpredictability of uneven migration of resolubilized reagents and sample flow which can affect the electronic interpretation of the test result resulting in an inaccurate test result determination. Unlike the lateral flow pregnancy test where the consumer merely looks for the presence of a line irrespective of its color intensity and its uniformity, in a digital pregnancy test it is extremely important that the test line is uniform in color intensity. However, this is not always possible due to the reasons cited above. Therefore, improved devices, methods, and test kits for electronic analyte assaying digital detection are desirable.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to deposition processes, and more particularly, systems for depositing an imprint onto a substrate.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Printing is a process of depositing a substance onto the surface of a substance receiving substrate to produce graphic images (e.g., text and designs). A typical example of printing involves depositing ink on paper using a printing press. The development of print technologies has provided major progress in many areas on a large scale basis including the dissemination of information and the manufacture of goods relying on such technologies. Two print methods commonly used for depositing or printing graphic images onto the receiving substrate are lithographic printing and screen printing.

Lithographic printing utilizes printing plates having patterns formed from a series of grooves into which a thick ink is initially deposited with a suitable applicator. The grooves are configured for retaining a quantity of ink, while the areas adjacent to the grooves are rendered free of ink through careful wiping and scraping. The corresponding pattern is transferred after impressing the ink-loaded grooves onto the substrate surface with sufficient pressure whereby the surface contacts the ink retained in the grooves. This method of printing is relatively inexpensive and the resolution, density and quality of the printed image is generally adequate. However, when used on soft, elastomeric materials, the printed images are less satisfactory.

Screen printing is a print method suitable for use on a wide range of materials including textiles, ceramics, wood, paper, glass, metal and plastic. The method involves the use of a woven mesh or screen supported on a frame. An ink-blocking stencil is formed by blocking off parts of the screen in the negative image of the print. The open, unblocked parts representing the positive image of the print permit passage of the ink unto the substrate surface. The ink is pressed through the open areas of the screen to deposit a sharp-edged image onto the substrate surface below. A fill blade or squeegee is generally used to force ink into the mesh openings by moving it across the stencil screen to promote transfer through capillary action. Screen printing is more versatile than traditional printing techniques. The surface does not have to be printed under pressure and it does not have to be planar or flat. Screen printing also provides good color depth, enhanced definition and overall better quality images.

High-throughput commercial printing utilizes solvent-based inks to ensure rapid drying and good adhesion to the substrate surface. However, such inks suffer several drawbacks. Certain substrates, such as those composed of an elastomeric material, are not compatible with such solvent-based inks. These inks are formulated with solvents that usually penetrate the elastomeric material causing temporary physical changes such as swelling. Although the elastomeric material eventually returns to its original state as the solvent evaporates, its physical properties including barrier integrity may be adversely affected. In addition to the problem of incompatibility with elastomeric materials, solvent-based inks contain components that pose potentially harmful health effects on humans through contact with such inks printed on such elastomeric materials.

Accordingly, there is a need for a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate, especially tubular or cylindrically-shaped substrates. There is also a need for a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate with improved precision and accuracy.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates generally to a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate. The system of the present invention is configured for depositing an imprint onto a substrate to produce graphic images including visual and/or tactile textures thereon. In this manner, the present invention can be implemented to form decorative and/or functional elements on the surface of the substrate. The system of the present invention is configured particularly for fabrication of articles that are at least substantially safe for prolonged contact with human tissue including the skin and mucous membranes.

In one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a system for depositing an imprint onto a substrate, including:a deposition surface having at least one outlet disposed therein;a substrate holder for holding the substrate against the deposition surface;means operatively associated with the deposition surface for supplying a material through the at least one outlet to deposit the material onto the substrate; anda spacer member disposed between the deposition surface and the substrate.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to bottle filling/capping. More particularly, the invention relates to methods and apparatus for positioning, a bottle neck during filling and/or capping.

An exemplary bottle filling/capping method and apparatus is illustrated in the context of a laundry detergent bottle. However, it may apply to other bottles.

In an exemplary bottle filling/capping process, bottles move along a flowpath through a series of operations. Exemplary operations may include filling, cap applying, labeling, inspection, and the like.

These may be further subdivided. For example, with laundry detergent bottles, capping may, involve a two-step process of first installing a spout fitment and then installing a cap. Alternatively, the spout fitment may be installed prior to filling. One exemplary group of bottles is shown in US Pre-Grant Publication No. 2009/0101682A1, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety as if set forth at length.

At various points along the flowpath, the bottles may need to be precisely positioned. One example involves positioning the bottle at capping where filled bottles (optionally with spout fitments preinstalled) receive caps and the caps are screwed down. More particularly, the cap may be screwed to a pre-installed spout fitment or the spout fitment with cap pre-installed may be screwed onto the bottle or snapped onto the bottle. In yet further variations, spout fitment pre-installation may be internal so that the cap screws onto the bottle.

To the extent that the bottles are not centered relative to the cap being delivered, the cap may fail to be properly installed and may damage the bottle and/or foul the assembly line. It is, therefore, desirable that the capping station precisely register the bottle relative to the cap being installed.

For registering the bottles, it is known to use a guide wheel having a circumferential array of guide members for engaging the bottle. The wheel rotates with the flowpath passing tangentially by or around the wheel so that at least one guide member may engage a bottle adjacent one or more associated capping tools. Exemplary capping tools each comprise one or more actuators for downwardly inserting the cap and rotating the cap to tighten it.

The exemplary guides have recesses nearly semicircular in planform (e.g., a circular are in the vicinity of 180°).

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

Certain aspects of the present invention generally relate to devices and methods for the electrochemical detection and quantitation of analyte in a sample.

Background

Point of care (POC) diagnostic tests are convenient and inexpensive devices useful for the detection of a target molecule, in a sample. POC tests are employed in a variety of settings, including for medical, consumer, or environmental purposes because of the low cost, ease of use, and, portability that they afford. POC tests have become increasingly popular in part because of the rapidity with which results are achieved and for the flexibility of configuring the devices for a variety of applications.

The lateral flow assay (LFA) is a POC diagnostic tool that is capable of determining the presence or absence of an analyte, typically, through visual observation of a discernible color change. One common example of such LFA tests is the conventional household pregnancy test. LFAs generally involve the use of a labeled antibody deposited at a first position on a solid substrate. Sample is applied to the first position, causing the labeled antibody to reconstitute in solution, whereupon the antibody binds to complementary analyte in the sample. Alternatively, labeled antibody is mixed with the sample prior to application on the LFA. In either case, a complex of analyte and antibody forms. The analyte-antibody complex flows along the liquid front from the first location through the solid substrate to a second location, a test line, where an immobilized antibody is located. The immobilized antibody captures the analyte through specific interaction, resulting in a high concentration of labeled antibody at the test line. The high concentration of labeled antibody provides a detectable visual signal. Gold nanoparticles are typically used to label the antibodies because they are relatively inexpensive and provide easily observable color indications based on the surface, plasmon resonance properties of gold nanoparticles. In many cases, this signal is used to, provide only, qualitative, information, such as whether or not the analyte is present in the sample.

FIGS. 1A and 1Bdepict a conventional one-step sandwich LFA12, as described in the prior art. The sandwich LFA12is comprised of a substrate13over or through which the liquid sample flows. The sandwich LFA12comprises an upstream region15and a downstream region17. Deposited on the substrate13at a first, region14are antibodies24conjugated to a visually or optically detectable particle25, such as a gold nanoparticle. When a sample is applied to the upstream region15of the substrate13, it may, flow over or through the substrate13to the downstream region17of the substrate13. The labeled antibodies are reconstituted by the sample liquid when the sample flows to and through the first region14. The labeled antibodies are reactive to a first epitope on an analyte of interest27which may be present in the sample, such that the labeled antibodies bind the analyte27when the sample passes through the first region14.

The substrate13also comprises a second region16, where capture antibodies26are deposited. The capture antibodies26are solubilized by the sample when the sample flows to and through the second region16. The capture antibodies have biotin29conjugated thereto, and are reactive to a second, different epitope on the antigen27, such that the capture antibodies26also bind to the analyte27when the analyte27passes through the second region16. The analyte27is therefore bound by both the labeled antibodies24and the capture antibodies26, forming a “sandwich” complex. The sandwich complex flows with the sample to a third region18forming a test line. The third region18has avidin28immobilized thereon. The avidin28binds to the biotin29on the capture antibodies26, thereby retaining the sandwich complex at the third region18, resulting in the accumulation of label particles25at the third region18, which provides for a visual determination of the presence of analyte27in the sample. Although this sandwich detection method has been widely used, it is also possible to immobilize the capture antibodies26at the third region18for trapping labeled antibody-antigen complexes at the third region18, and eliminating the second region16.

Labeled antibodies24that are not bound to analyte27continue to flow past the third region18to an optional fourth region20forming a control line. The fourth region20has immobilized antibodies deposited thereon which bind to the labeled antibodies (e.g. species specific antibodies). Thus, when the analyte of interest27is present in the sample, a visual signal may be detected both at the third region18and at the fourth region20. However, if the analyte27is not present in the sample, a visual signal is detected only at the fourth region20.

FIG. 1Bis a schematic representation of the binding interactions that take place at the third region18. Labeled antibodies bind to a first epitope on the analyte27in the sample. Capture antibodies26with biotin29conjugated thereon binds to a second epitope on the analyte27, forming the sandwich complex. Avidin28is immobilized on the third region18, and bind to the biotin that is conjugated to the capture antibodies26. The result is the capture of the sandwich complex, thereby providing the visual signal indicating the presence of the analyte27in the sample.

Recent efforts in the field of LFAs have focused on creating devices capable of quantitating the amount of analyte present in the sample. Such information is important, for example, when the amount of analyte in sample, rather than merely its presence, provides the required information. For example, a baseline level of analyte may be normal, but elevated analyte may be indicative of disease when it exceeds some threshold level.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed towards an aqueous lubricant composition and its method of production thereof.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Lubrication is the process or technique that reduces wear of one or both surfaces that move relative to each other in close proximity. Lubricants prevent or lessen wear and irritation between the surfaces.

Personal lubricants for intercourse are well known and are useful for providing lubricity to various parts of the body, such as mucous membranes (e.g. oral, rectal, vaginal). These compositions may be in the form of jellies, liquids, vaginal suppositories, oils or emulsions. When applied onto condoms, these lubricants also facilitate unrolling of the condom as well as preventing the surfaces of the rolled condom from sticking together as the products age in storage.

Water-based personal lubricants are water-soluble and are the most widely used personal lubricants. These lubricants are easy to clean up, non-staining to fabrics and are formulated to be nonirritating. The viscosity of these products can be altered by adjusting their water content and concentration of cellulose or other gel-forming hydrophilic ingredients. However, because water-based personal lubricants absorb into the skin and mucous membranes and evaporate, these lubricants have a tendency to dry out during use. Very often, the water-based lubricant has to be reapplied to extend the intimate activity. This is one of the chief drawbacks of water-based lubricants, since reapplication is distracting and “breaks the mood”.

To improve product lubricity, water-based lubricants are often formulated with high levels of polyhydric alcohols such as propylene glycol, glycerin or sorbitol that function as humectants. For example, the marketed K-Y® NATURAL FEELING® Liquid, which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,591 to Ahmad, et al. comprises about 30% glycerin, about 5% propylene glycol and about 10% sorbitol. In addition to polyhydric alcohols, surfactants are also added to water-based lubricants to reduce the attraction between water molecules, thereby making the lubricants more slippery and less sticky. For example, commercially available water-based lubricants of the ASTROGLIDE® series all contain surfactants such as polyquaternium-15.

Recent studies have shown that personal lubricants that contain polyhydric alcohols or surfactants may damage the vagina and rectum cell linings, potentially making the user more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (see O. Begay et al.,AIDS Research and Human retroviruses,27, 1-6, 2011; L. K. WolfC&EN90(50), 46-49, 2012). According to O. Begay, et al., the damaging effect is dependent upon osmolality of the lubricant. Osmolality is a parameter that indicates the overall concentration of the molecular ingredients in a composition. Osmolality is measured in moles (osmoles) of solute per kilogram of solvent. Mice that were exposed to lubricants with high osmolality were more susceptible to infections. Many water-based lubricants on the market have high osmolality, as they contain large amounts of ingredients such as propylene glycol, glycerin and sorbitol, which contribute to high numbers of moles of solutes per kg of solute.

A preferred type of personal lubricant is silicone-based. Silicone-based personal lubricants are very lubricious and do not dry out. Further, they are hypoallergenic, safe to use with condoms and are less damaging to cells because of their low osmolality. However, the main drawback of silicone-based lubricants is that they are greasy and can be difficult to cleanup.

To deliver the benefits of both water- and silicone-based lubricants, oil-in-water (o/w) emulsions-based lubricants have been developed and marketed. These lubricants are typically opaque or “milky” in appearance, which is caused by the difference in refractive index between the aqueous phase and the oil phase. LIQUID SILK® and SYSTEM JO® Hybrid are examples of emulsion-based personal lubricants.

To make the emulsion lubricants clear and transparent, and thus more appealing to consumers, two approaches have been taken. The first approach involves matching the refractive index between the two immiscible phases. The second approach involves the use of high concentrations of emulsifiers to form micro-emulsions. The oil droplets in the micro-emulsions are smaller than the light wavelength, thus making the emulsion appear clear. U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,848 to Ahmad, et al. discloses micro-emulsion-based lubricants, which are highly lubricious, clear and transparent. However, these micro-emulsion-based lubricants also have high levels of polyhydric alcohols (up to 45% w/w), which may harm vaginal cells.

An alternative to known water-based and silicone-based personal lubricants has been developed using hyaluronic acid (“HA”) as a lubricating component to relieve vaginal dryness. For example, U.S. Patent Application No. 2010/0284937 to Zhao, et al. teaches a vaginal lubricant comprising a high molecular weight HA and a low molecular weight component selected from low molecular weight HA and chitosan, wherein the low molecular weight component stabilizes the lubricant.

U.S. Patent Application No. 2009/0143331 to Strompoulis, et al., teaches a cosmetic composition comprising at least one polysaccharide such as HA and encapsulating at least one inhibitor of degradation into the polysaccharide.

U.S. Pat. No. 4,869,270 to Uneo, et al., teaches a condom comprising a coating made from polysaccharide such as HA, wherein the coating is an aqueous solution that contains 10-70% concentration of the HA.

U.S. Patent Application No. 2011/0171286 to Cecile, et al., teaches an HA gel formulation for treating skin, comprising hyaluronic acid and at least one additional constituent selected from the group consisting of vitamin B, C and E, wherein the formulation exhibits greater stability.

However, the exemplary prior art either teaches a composition that requires a special ingredient to stabilize the HA, a high amount of HA of at least 10%, or the viscosity of the taught composition is undesirably low, causing the lubricant to be too watery and being retained poorly during contact in sexual intercourse.

Therefore, there continues to be a need for new personal lubricants that impart some of the benefits of both water-based lubricants (clear, easy to clean, non-staining) and silicone oil-based lubricants (highly lubricious, low osmolality). More specifically, there is a need for novel lubricants that match closely to the vaginal fluid to provide a natural alternative to commercially available personal lubricants. Furthermore, the lubricants should be compatible with lubricated and non-lubricated latex, polyurethane and synthetic PI condoms.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention is directed towards an aqueous lubricant composition comprising hyaluronic acid (“HA”) as a moisturizing component and an aqueous carrier.

"FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that provide user connectivity. More particularly, the test devices include elements that provide for specific feedback to the user, such as through audible means.

BACKGROUND

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Some commercially available assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis.

U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test cell or device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as glass fiber) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive a fluid sample transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. The conjugate can take two distinct forms, depending on whether the assay is designed to exploit the “sandwich” or “competitive” technique.

U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic test device including a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic substrate is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single fluid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

For tests such as those described above, visually observable indicia can be preferred. Such indicia typically have included the presence of agglutination or a color change at a defined site on the assay. More recent efforts have included providing electronic (i.e., digital) signals as the observable indicia. Nevertheless, user interface with diagnostic test devices remain limited. For example, user interface disconnect can lead to user anxiety, such as in relation to uncertainty over the elapsed time between starting a test and obtaining the test result. In typical pregnancy test devices, for example, the elapsed time is typically less than five minutes. During this time, there also can be anxiety over whether the test is indeed progressing normally. For example, although some test devices include a liquid crystal display (LCD) digital readout that can display a static or blinking clock as indicia of a progressing test, such interface can be sufficiently limited so as to not meet user expectations and overcome anxiety. Another user interface disconnect can relate to user uncertainty over whether a sufficient volume of fluid sample (e.g., urine) has been applied in order for the test to progress normally and provide a valid test result. Because of these and other reasons, it would be beneficial to provide a personal use test device with improved communication between the test device and the user.

SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE

The present disclosure relates to diagnostic test devices that include elements useful for carrying out an assay and for providing information related to the assay in an audible format. As an illustrative example, a pregnancy test device can be provided and can include elements for carrying out a test on a fluid sample applied to a receiving member so as to identify the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the sample that is indicative of a pregnancy status. Such test device beneficially can include further elements that enable the test device to provide a variety of audible indices relating to the operation and results of the assay. Test devices according to the present disclosure thus can provide for increased communication from the test device to a user thereof and make the test device easier for the user to operate, improve understanding of the results of the included assay, and increase user comfort with the test device and user assurance in the reliability of the test device.

In certain embodiments, a diagnostic test device according to the present disclosure can comprise a test member (for example, a test strip, particularly a strip adapted for carrying out a lateral flow assay) and an electronic communication circuit adapted to provide one or more indicia of operation of the test member to a user. More specifically, the electronic communication circuit can include an audio output component. For example, the audio output component can comprise a transducer (i.e., a loudspeaker or a buzzer). The audio output component also can comprise an audio driver that can be a circuit with a built-in oscillator and that can be useful to drive the audio output from the loudspeaker or buzzer. In further embodiments, the audio output component can include an audio chip. Beneficially, the audio chip can include a memory device that is useful to increase the breadth of sounds that can be output from the audio component. Specifically, the memory device can include one or more programmed digital sequences corresponding to an output sound. In light of the variety of audio output elements that can be utilized in the present test device, a wide variety of sounds can be output from the test device. For example, the output sound can be selected from the group consisting of buzzing, a single tone, a series of tones, a melody, a synthesized word or words, a recorded word or words, and combinations thereof. If desired, the test device further can comprise a switching element adapted to enable or disable the audio output component.

In addition to the foregoing, a test device according to the present disclosure can include further components. Specifically, the electronic communication circuit of the test device further can include a microcontroller that can be adapted to signal the audio output component to provide an audible indicia of operation of the test member. Any aspect of the test device that can be adapted to audible description thereof can be relayed by the audio component of the test device under the direction of the microcontroller. As illustrative examples, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate that a defined volume of a fluid sample has been applied to a sample receiving member of the test device for the assay to be carried out. Likewise, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to provide one or more instructions for carrying out the assay. Further, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate one or more times that the assay is processing an applied liquid sample. The microcontroller also can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate that the test device has completed processing an applied fluid sample. Still further, the microcontroller can be adapted to signal the audio output component to indicate a test result arising from the test having processed an applied fluid sample. Further to the foregoing examples, the audio output from the present test device need not be limited to the use and results of the test member of the test device. Any further audio output that may be desirable for delivery to a user of the test device can also be provided, particularly in embodiments that incorporate an audio chip and associated memory. For example, marketing information and the like may be communicated by the test device according to the present disclosure.

The diagnostic test device further can comprise components suitable to carry out a test initiation routine. Specifically, the components can include a signaling mechanism in communication with the microcontroller. For example, a switch or sensor may be included to provide indication that a cap of the test device has been removed or that the device has been removed from packaging material (e.g., a foil pouch) so as to ready the test device for use thereof. A defined power on button or capacitive sensing element also may be included to provide manual control for a user to turn the test device on when ready for use thereof. As such, the test device also can include a power source, such as a battery, or any similar element.

The electronic communication circuit of the test further can comprise one or more components adapted to provide input signals to the microcontroller that relate to the test. For example, the electronic communication circuit can include a light source (such as a light emitting diode) and a light sensor. Such components together can form an opto-detector. As such, the word “light” is intended to encompass the entire spectrum of electromagnetic radiation and is not limited to visible light. Thus, for example, ultraviolet and infrared detectors are encompassed. In further embodiments, the electronic communication circuit can include a moisture sensor for providing input signals to the microcontroller, particularly as indication that sufficient sample has been applied to the test device for the assay to proceed normally. Such various elements of the communication circuit thus are desirably positioned within the test device (i.e., within the casing) so that the elements are positioned appropriately for detecting information to be input to the microcontroller.

The diagnostic test device of the present disclosure also can include means for relaying information to a user in a manner other than audibly. For example, the electronic communication circuit can include a display. Specifically, a liquid crystal display (LCD) can be provided so as to allow for digital display of words, images, and the like. Alternatively, the display can be an analog display. Still further, the display can be simply a window in the casing of the test device that enables viewing of a defined section of the assay test strip. Additionally, the test device can include components adapted to cause vibration, and a vibration signal or vibration pattern can be utilized to indicate to a user a defined status of the test device.

As noted above, the test device of the present disclosure includes elements useful for carrying out an assay. Specifically, the test device can include a lateral flow assay that is adapted to detect the presence of an analyte in a sample applied to the assay. In addition to hCG, as noted previously, the analyte can be, for example, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, or metabolites thereof, or the like. Other analytes—e.g., proteins—can also be detected by the presently disclosed test device.

The present disclosure also encompasses methods for providing one or more indicia of operation of a test to a user. In certain embodiments, the method can comprise combining, in a single casing: the test member; and an electronic communication circuit. The electronic communication circuit can include any combination of the elements otherwise disclosed herein. In certain embodiments, the communication circuit can include: a microcontroller; one or more components adapted to provide input signals to the microcontroller relating to the lateral flow assay; and an audio output component. The method further can comprise programming the microcontroller to respond to a defined input signal by signaling the audio output component to emit a corresponding audio signal. Any audio signal as otherwise disclosed herein can be encompassed by the method.

BACKGROUND

Field

The embodiments disclosed herein relate to test devices and methods for assessing male fertility.

Description of the Related Art

Male fertility is generally assessed by counting the number of sperm per milliliter in a semen sample. Traditionally, this has been done manually by a trained andrologist. A semen sample is placed under a microscope, and the number of observed sperm are counted in a given area of view. This count is correlated to sample volume to produce a value for sperm per milliliter. In addition to sperm count, sperm motility is also a significant factor in assessing male fertility. A qualitative assessment of sperm motility can be made by visually evaluating the motion of the sperm in the sample under the microscope. These microscope systems are generally expensive, and can produce inconsistent results, even when used by well trained personnel.

Home use reagent based sperm count assays have been developed, such as the SpermCheck® male fertility test kit produced by ContraVac, Inc. and Princeton BioMeditech Corp. This kit can be used at home for a threshold test of sperm count. However, a numerical result for sperm count is not obtainable with this test kit, and it has no facility for assessing sperm motility.

SUMMARY

In one implementation, a male fertility assessment apparatus comprises a housing having a maximum linear dimension of no more than 100 mm and wherein the ratios of height to width, height to length, and length to width are between 0.1 and 10, and having a bright field imaging system contained within the housing. In this implementation, the bright field imaging system comprises a backlight, an optical assembly comprising a lens system having front and back focal lengths of no more than 20 mm each, and an aperture area of 1-10 mm2. The front focal length divided by the square root of the aperture area and the back focal length divided by the square root of the aperture area are each at least 5. The system also comprises a two-dimensional light sensor defining an image plane location that is fixed with respect to the position of the lens system. The apparatus further comprises a sample holder, and a sample chamber configured for placement in the sample holder to define an object plane location that is fixed with respect to the position of the lens system. The image plane position, object plane position, and front and back focal lengths define a magnification of no more than 10. The apparatus further comprises processing circuitry contained within the housing coupled to the light sensor and configured to process data received from the light sensor to assess one or more sperm characteristics, and an output coupled to the processing circuitry and configured to output data indicating one or more sperm characteristics.

In another implementation, a method of assessing male fertility comprises placing a semen sample into a sample chamber having a depth of no more than 0.05 mm, inserting the sample chamber into a sample holder positioned adjacent to a lens, illuminating the sample chamber, producing an image of the semen sample on a two-dimensional light sensor positioned on the other side of the lens from the sample chamber and no more than 50 mm from the center of the sample chamber, processing image data from the two-dimensional light sensor, and outputting an assessment of male fertility based at least in part on the processing.

In another implementation, a male fertility assessment apparatus comprises a housing, a light source in the housing, a fixed two-dimensional light sensor in the housing, a fixed sample holder in the housing defining a sample chamber position located between the light source and the fixed two-dimensional light sensor. The defined sample chamber position is no more than 50 mm from the fixed two-dimensional light sensor. The apparatus also includes one or more fixed lenses in the housing positioned between the fixed sample holder and the fixed two dimensional light sensor, and processing circuitry in the housing coupled to receive image data from the fixed two dimensional light sensor.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to containers. More particularly, the invention relates to pour spouts for containers for liquid laundry detergent and the like.

There has been an evolution in the configuration of containers for liquid laundry detergent, fabric softener, and the like. The dominant form of container is a wide mouth bottle having an attached spout with a drain-back trough and aperture. In a typical group of container configurations and their methods of assembly, a bottle, spout fitment, and cap are individually molded (e.g., of high density polyethylene (HDPE)). Exemplary bottle molding is via roto-molding whereas exemplary spout fitment and cap molding are by injection molding. An exemplary spout fitment includes the spout and a continuation of the spout defining the base and outboard wall of the trough. The fitment further typically includes a flange (e.g., extending outward at an upper end of the outboard extremity of the trough).

The spout fitment may be inserted through a mouth of the bottle (e.g., so that an outer surface of the outboard trough wall whereof another wall outboard thereof engages the inner surface of the bottle neck). The spout fitment may be secured and sealed to the bottle such as by spin welding. The bottle may be filled and the cap may be installed. Exemplary caps typically have either an externally threaded skirt for engaging an internally threaded portion of the fitment or an internally threaded skirt for engaging an externally threaded portion of the fitment or bottle neck. With a typical externally threaded skirt, the cap includes an outwardly projecting flange above the skirt. Upon installation of the cap to the fitment, the flange underside contacts and seals with the fitment flange upper surface to seal the bottle.

One recently-proposed bottle configuration is shown in US2008/0164282, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein as if set forth at length.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

One aspect of the disclosure involves a dispensing cap/cup having a sidewall and a transverse web spanning the sidewall to create a cup structure. The sidewall has an interior surface and an exterior surface. The sidewall has a plurality of fill level indicia along the interior surface. The fill level indicia comprise a raised boundary and texturing within the boundary.

In various embodiments, at least some of the indicia boundaries have off-longitudinal lateral portions. Each of the indicia may further include a raised alphanumeric indicator.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to apparatus for filling containers and related methods. More specifically, the present invention relates to rotary filling apparatus and related methods.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Containers of various sorts including bottles and cans and jars, etc., are commonly filled with liquid type products in a production line by a rotary type piston filling machines. In general, containers arrive on a conveyor line and are successively applied onto a turret in underlying relation with a revolving piston type filler. The filler has a piston moving in an upright cylinder, and the piston is reciprocated upwardly and downwardly during revolving of the filler and turret so that the liquid product is drawn into the piston and is subsequently expelled from the piston into the container being filled. The amount of liquid product that is supplied into the container in the filling operation is measured by the magnitude of the piston movement in the cylinder, and the size of the cylinder.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

Embodiments of the invention include apparatus for filling containers and related methods. In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, a filler plenum assembly, piston assemblies, a cam track, and a fluid supply group. The rotary turret assembly can include a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns. The plurality of hollow columns can be mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The piston assemblies can move up and down within the plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can further include a cam contact member. Rotation of the rotary turret assembly causes the cam contact member to move over a surface of the cam track causing vertical movement of the piston assemblies relative to the plurality of hollow columns.

In various embodiments the cam track can include a first rising portion, a second rising portion, a first declining portion, a first flat portion, and a second declining portion. The first rising portion can correspond to a filling phase. The second rising portion can correspond to an overfilling phase. The first declining portion can correspond to a purging phase. The first flat portion can correspond to a hold phase. The second declining portion can correspond to a dispensing phase.

In an embodiment, the invention includes a method for filling containers. The method for filling containers can include rotating a rotary turret assembly, the rotary turret assembly comprising a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns mounted on the rotary base and arranged in a circle. The method can further include contacting a cam contact member against a cam track to cause piston assemblies disposed within the hollow columns to move up and down, drawing a food material into a bottom portion of the hollow columns when the piston assemblies move up. The method can further include dispensing the food material into a container when the piston assemblies move down. In various embodiments, the amount of the food material drawn into the hollow column exceeds the amount ultimately dispensed into the container.

In an embodiment, the invention includes an apparatus for filling containers. The apparatus for filling containers can include a filler frame, a rotary turret assembly, a filler plenum assembly, piston assemblies, a sensor, a lever actuator, a cam track, and a fluid supply group. The rotary turret assembly can include a rotary base and a plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can move up and down within the plurality of hollow columns. The piston assemblies can include a piston body and a top hat assembly. The top hat assembly can include a cam contact member and a release lever.

The top hat assembly can be configured to releasably engage the top of the piston body. The release lever can allow the piston body and the top hat assembly to release from one another when the release lever is engaged. The sensor can detect the presence or absence of a container to be filled. The lever actuator can be configured to contact the release lever when the sensor indicates that a container to be filled is absent. Upon rotation of the rotary turret assembly, the cam contact member moves over a surface of the cam track. However, because the cam contact member is operably connected to the top hat assembly, rotation of the rotary turret assembly only causes vertical movement of the piston body only if the top hat assembly is connected to the piston body.

"FIELD

The present invention relates to the field of analyte detection systems and methods, with particular applicability to predicting the timing of ovulation.

BACKGROUND

Analysis of the levels of hormone in an individual can provide important and helpful prognostic information. For example, detected hormone levels may enable an evaluation of a woman's health concerns such as fertility, pregnancy and menopause. One component in evaluating a woman's fertility status is assessing her ovulatory function. The average menstrual cycle generally lasts 28 days, during which there is a transition from the follicular phase to the luteal phase. The follicular phase of the menstrual cycle begins on the first day of menstruation and is followed by a rise in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and estrogen, the latter promoting the maturation of a follicle. Once estrogen levels reach an optimal concentration and duration, the pituitary gland is prompted to release a large burst of LH secretion that significantly raises the concentration of circulating LH in blood. This rise in circulating hormone is known as LH surge. This surge in LH marks the transition to the luteal phase of the cycle, resulting in final maturation of the follicle, release of a mature oocyte from the follicle (ovulation), and corpus luteum formation. After ovulation, estrogen levels continue to rise along with an increase in progesterone levels in order to prepare the endometrium for implantation. If fertilization of the oocyte occurs, the implantation of the fertilized oocyte within the uterine endometrial lining triggers production of human chorionic gonadotropins (hCG) that maintains the corpus luteum and progesterone production. However in the absence of fertilization, the corpus luteum deteriorates resulting in a decrease in the levels of both estrogen and progesterone, and sloughing of the endometrial lining thereby marking the onset of the next cycle.

In assessing ovulatory function, daily measurements of LH levels may be used to predict the timing of ovulation. The rise in blood LH may occur ˜24-36 hours prior to ovulation.

Measurements of serum progesterone levels 18 to 24 days after the onset of menses or seven days before the next cycle may be used to confirm whether ovulation had occurred. In the event of a confirmed pregnancy, serum progesterone levels may be utilized to assess nonviable pregnancies, e.g., ectopic pregnancy or spontaneous abortion (miscarriage). In pregnant individuals, a serum progesterone value of ≥25 ng/ml is 98% of the time associated with a viable pregnancy, while a value of <5 ng/ml identifies a nonviable pregnancy.

Another component in evaluating a woman's fertility status may be assessing the functioning potential of the ovary with respect to the quantity and quality of the oocytes within the ovary, commonly referred to as ovarian reserve. An acceleration of follicular loss is prevalent in the last 10-15 years before menopause. This loss correlates with a subtle increase in FSH. One test that may be used to assess ovarian reserve is the Day 3 FSH test. This test determines the level of FSH on cycle day three during which estrogen level is expected to be low. A cycle day three FSH level <10 IU/L is suggestive of adequate ovarian reserve, whereas an FSH level >25 IU/L is associated with a chance of pregnancy close to zero during ovulation induction.

A woman's fertility may also be affected by fluctuations in thyroid gland function. The measurement of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels may be used as a screening test. Briefly, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) prompts the pituitary gland to produce TSH. However, THR also prompts the pituitary to release more of the hormone prolactin (PRL). Elevations of PRL can interfere with ovulation by suppressing release of the hormones LH and FSH, which stimulate the ovary. Low levels of TSH may also interfere with the rate of metabolism of sex hormones, which may also cause ovulatory disorders. Menstrual irregularities and bleeding problems are common in hypothyroid women.

Diagnostic tests for screening analytes, e.g. urinary hormones or metabolites thereof, may utilize antibodies specific to the analyte. A change in the level from a predetermined threshold level may be noted by differences in color or color intensity compared with the color in a reference window or a reference guide. The color change may be produced using techniques such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or lateral flow color matching assays to indicate the amount of analyte in a urine sample.

Improvements to the diagnostic tests for fertility monitoring have been made by removing the step which required the individual to interpret the results. In these products, electronic sensors and displays provide clear outputs indicating analyte levels. For example, the Clearblue® Easy Fertility Monitor (CBEFM) provides a method for monitoring the fertility status of an individual using two hormones: LH and estrogen with electronic reading and a digital display. The Clearblue® Digital Ovulation Test (CDOT) is another commercially available device, which employs a variable threshold for LH surge determination, and is also an improvement over the color matching visually read tests. Although both CBEFM and CDOT show improvement over the art, there still remains a need for such diagnostic devices that are affordable to the average consumer and provide simplicity of use over the prior art. Accordingly, improvements in detection systems are desirable.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

This invention is directed to non-irritating personal lubricant compositions with functional sensorial agents.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Personal lubricants for intimate contact are well known. In recent years, it has become increasingly popular to add various functional agents to personal lubricant compositions in order to, for example, enhance pleasurable feelings during sexual activity and/or to heighten sexual arousal. Examples of such products include K-Y® Warming Liquid and Durex® Play Tingling. K-Y® Warming Liquid is a water-soluble, anhydrous composition that warms on contact while providing lubrication. Durex® Play Tingling is a water-soluble composition with a unique blend of agents that warms, cools and tingles while providing lubrication.

Using condoms containing lubricants which include sensorial agents has also been proposed. Producing such lubricated condoms is somewhat challenging, particularly if the lubricant is to be applied both on the inside and on the outside of the condom. Conventional machinery used in condom manufacture mandates that the lubricant composition have relatively tight specifications, for example, in terms of viscosity, tackiness and stringiness, as well as providing the desired degree of lubricity.

Personal lubricants comprising functional agents are designed to cause physiological or physical changes in the area to which they are applied. These functional agents range from agents that self-warm when exposed to moisture, e.g. polyols, agents that act on nerve endings to simulate a perceived sensation such as warming, cooling and/or tingling, and agents that could in sufficient quantity increase localized blood flow, e.g. vasodilators.

Self-warming lubricants are known in the art. They generate heat or warming when placed in contact with moisture on the human body, e.g. K-Y® Warming Liquid. The warming effect is created by a phenomenon known as heat of dilution; some agents when diluted with water release energy in the form of heat; e.g., polyethylene glycol. When blended with an anhydrous composition, the product upon dilution provides a slight warming effect.

Thermoreceptors belong to the class of transient receptor potential (TRP). TRP subfamily V, members 1 to 3 (TRPV1 to TRPV3) are activated by heat. TRPV4, TRP subfamily A, member 1 (TRPA1) and TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) are activated by cold. The cold receptor TRPA1 when activated by noxious cold produces a pain-like sensation, which paradoxically produces a human sensorial effect often described as “hot”.

Lubricants that provide a perceived sensation are also known in the art. For example, Trojan® Fire & Ice® condom comprises a lubricant composition on the condom that utilizes vanillyl butyl ether (VBE) to simulate a perceived warming sensation and menthol to simulate a perceived cooling sensation. Chemical warming agents (such as VBE) bind TRPV1 on sensory neurons. Chemical cooling agents (such as menthol) bind to TRPM8 or cold and menthol receptor 1 (CMR1).

However, some agents like VBE, menthol, vasodilators, and various natural extracts, e.g. sichuan, jambu, ginger, maca, etc., are known to be skin irritants. Such compositions have the disadvantage of causing irritation to the mucosa, which can be problematic in relation to the vaginal or oral mucosa as irritation may disrupt the sexual experience. Accordingly, there remains a need to deliver a sensory stimuli using a personal lubricant while minimizing the effect of irritation.

"FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In particular, the invention relates to an improved electronic device for detecting an analyte in a body fluid and a method of using the device for assay test results.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of various substances in body fluids, such as urine, saliva, or blood. Many of these assays are designed to make a quantitative determination, but in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative positive/negative indication. Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, and many types of urinalysis. For these tests, visually observable indicia, such as the presence of agglutination or a color change, are preferred.

Qualitative ‘positive/negative’ assays require a high degree of sensitivity due to the often low concentration of the ligand of interest present in the test fluid. False positives can be troublesome, particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays and other sensitive detection methods which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed.

A common type of device that incorporates the use of such biological interactions is a test strip assay device. U.S. Pat. No. 6,485,982, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a diagnostic device formed of an elongate outer casing which houses an interior permeable material (such as fiber glass) capable of transporting an aqueous solution by capillary action, wicking, or simple wetting. The casing defines a sample inlet, and interior regions, which are designated as a test volume and a reservoir volume. The reservoir volume is disposed in a section of the test cell spaced apart from the inlet and is filled with sorbent material. The reservoir acts to receive liquid transported along a flow path defined by the permeable material and extending from the inlet and through the test volume. In the test volume is a test site comprising a first protein having a binding site specific to a first epitope of the ligand immobilized in fluid communication with the flow path (e.g., bound to the permeable material or to latex particles entrapped in or bonded to the permeable material). A window, such as a hole or transparent section of the casing, permits observations of the test site through the casing wall. The method of use of the test cell requires the use of a conjugate comprising a second protein bound to colored particles, such as a metal sol or colloid, preferably gold. U.S. Pat. No. 7,045,342, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes an improved diagnostic device including a test strip comprising of a biphasic chromatographic medium. The biphasic chromatographic medium is formed of a release medium joined to a capture medium located downstream of the release medium. The release and capture media preferably comprise two different materials, or phases, having different specific characteristics. The two phases are joined together to form a single liquid path such that a solvent front can travel unimpeded from the proximal (upstream) end of the release medium to the distal (downstream) end of the capture medium.

A purely visual (i.e., human eye dependent) diagnostic test as exemplified above requires proper interpretation of the results. However, devices have been developed to provide an automated detector system for determining sufficient color development at a test site and for also ensuring that the color intensity is read/interpreted at the appropriate time after sample application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,546 discloses an integrated reader and a test-strip wherein the test strip is provided with additional electrodes which sense the presence of fluid on the test strip which generates a signal to switch on the sensing electronics. The device includes a housing having an exterior surface and defining an interior area. A sample receptor receives the sample. Reagents on a test strip react with the sample to yield a physically detectable change which correlates with the amount of selected analyte in the sample. A detector responds to the physically detectable change and produces an electrical signal which correlates to the amount of the selected analyte in the sample. A processor converts the electrical signal to a digital output. In another example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,220,597 discloses an integrated reader with a test-strip activated by a mechanical switch means, wherein the switch means is responsive to the removal of a lid from the device housing. The device also requires a sample sensor for detecting the presence of the sample, wherein sample presence signal generates a time delay, and a reaction sensor responsive to the time delay for detecting an analyte in the fluid sample.

Although diagnostic devices, such as those described above, show improvements over the art, there still remains a need for test devices providing greater accuracy and sensitivity. For example, in the field of pregnancy testing, accurate and rapid detection of low levels of hCG is desired to allow consumers to confirm pregnancy soon after conception has occurred.

"BACKGROUND

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to diagnostic assays for analytes in a liquid sample. In some embodiments, methods and devices for the detection of an analyte in a body fluid using, impedance are provided.

Description of the Related Art

Many types of ligand-receptor assays have been used to detect the presence of analytes in body fluids such as saliva, urine or blood. These assays typically involve antigen-antibody reactions, synthetic conjugates comprising enzymatic, fluorescent, or visually observable tags, and specially designed reactor chambers. In most of these assays, there is a receptor (e.g., an antibody) specific for the selected analyte (e.g., antigen), and a means for detecting the presence and/or amount of the antigen-antibody reaction product. Although some commercially available tests are designed to a quantitative determination, in many circumstances all that is required is a qualitative indication (e.g., positive/negative). Examples of such qualitative assays include blood typing, pregnancy testing, ovulation prediction and many types of urinalysis.

Diagnostic assays should generally be very sensitive because of the often low concentrations of analytes of interest, present in a test fluid. False positives can be problematic particularly with agglutination and other rapid detection methods such as dipstick and color change tests. Because of these problems, sandwich assays which use metal sols or other types of colored particles have been developed that rely on the interaction between avidin and biotin-tagged antibodies. For example, in some commercially available pregnancy tests, an antibody-antigen sandwich complex comprising a colloidal gold-labeled anti-hCG antibody and an anti-hCG biotin-labeled antibody is used. Test strips of this nature are known in the art, and are described in more detail in, for example,FIGS. 2-6and the accompanying description of U.S. Pat. No. 6,319,676, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.

Other proposals have sought to exploit the changes in impedance that occur due to the presence of metal-labeled antibodies. For example, International Application Publication No. WO2013/083686, the content of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, discloses electrodes located on test and reference regions measuring changes in capacitance. A difference in capacitance between the test and reference regions is indicative of the presence and quantity of a bound metal and thus of the target analyte. However, in such systems the changes in the capacitance are small, and the layout thus requires precision. This requires more precise tools and other improvements to the designing, building and assembling of such devices. Thus, burdensome constraints are imposed on production, driving up costs for end users. Therefore, it is desirable to have further improvements in the design, reliability, and ease of manufacture for impedance-based assays and to provide the market with affordable test kits.

SUMMARY

In one aspect, a device for detecting an analyte in a fluid sample is disclosed. In some embodiments, the device comprises a strip comprising a sample receiving region configured to receive the fluid sample, a capture region, and a non-capture region.

In some embodiments, measuring the drying-dependent impedance difference over a drying time period further comprises calculating drying rates of the capture and non-capture regions. In some embodiments, the drying rates indicate the presence and/or a quantity of the analyte in the fluid sample. In some embodiments calculating the drying rates comprises, measuring a first impedance of the capture region at a first time, measuring a second impedance of the non-capture region at the first time, measuring a third impedance of the capture region at a second time later than the first time, measuring a fourth impedance of the non-capture region at the second time, determining a first impedance difference based on subtracting the first impedance from the third, impedance, determining a second impedance difference based on subtracting the second impedance from the fourth impedance, determining a time difference based on subtracting the first time from the second time, determining a capture region drying rate based on dividing the first impedance difference by the time difference and determining a non-capture region drying rate based on dividing the second impedance difference by the time difference.

"BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

The present invention relates generally to diagnostic assays for analytes in a fluid sample. In particular, the invention relates to devices and methods for detecting an analyte in a bodily fluid.

Description of the Related Art

Detection of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine samples is routinely used to determine a woman's pregnant/non-pregnant status. Traditional one-step pregnancy test devices detect hCG by utilizing a double antibody system in a lateral flow format resulting in a “sandwich” complex of hCG, a capture antibody and a labeled antibody, which is captured at a specific detection area on a test strip. A digital version of the pregnancy test device consists of an opto-electronic reader powered by an internal battery that measures the absorbance/reflectance of the label particles specifically captured at the detection area of the test strip and automatically subtracts any non-specific background color from an adjacent area of the test strip that is outside the detection area. The adjusted measurement of absorbance/reflectance of accumulated label particles at the detection area is processed to generate a detection determination for display as a clearly read YES+/PREGNANT or NO−/NOT PREGNANT digital result on a liquid crystal display (LCD) screen.

Although electronic readers provide the added convenience of eliminating the end-user step of interpreting the results of the test, a step required in traditional lateral flow devices, there is room for improvements.

"FIELD

The present application is directed toward the field of demulcents and more particularly to comestibles containing demulcents in a form that is not fully hydrated until consumed.

BACKGROUND

When an individual is affected with a sore throat and/or a cough they often seek an item to provide relief. One such item may include a demulcent. Demulcents soothe or soften minor pain and/or inflammation, usually through formation of a film over a mucous membrane.

One type of demulcent includes pectin, which may be delivered in demulcent throat soothers such as hard candy, chewy candy, or gummies. However, current methods for forming throat soothers including pectin or other demulcents require pre-hydration generally involving the addition of water, processing of hydrated pectin granules, and subsequent dehydration. Additionally, current methods of employing pectin for use as a demulcent is believed to rely upon particles 100 microns or larger, which is the size at which pectin is generally commercially available.

What is needed is a comestible containing a demulcent that does not require pre-hydration for item formation, does not contain demulcent particles perceivable by the individual's tongue, and has a rapid hydrolysis resulting in quicker soothing benefits.

SUMMARY

Exemplary embodiments are directed to comestibles that contain or have a coating that contains a finely ground demulcent that does not require pre-hydration and that exhibits faster, more complete relief when consumed.

In one embodiment, a comestible comprises a sweetener and demulcent granules having a particle size such that the demulcent is not perceived by the human tongue, wherein the demulcent granules are not fully hydrated.

In one embodiment, the comestible comprises a pressed tablet comprising a sweetener selected from the group consisting of sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, erythritol, xylitol, isomalt, lactitol and combinations thereof, and 0.3% to 5% by weight pectin granules having a median particle size less than 50 microns, wherein the pectin granules are not fully hydrated.

Embodiments may employ other types of comestibles, sweeteners, and demulcents all as more fully described herein.

In another embodiment, a method of forming a comestible comprises providing demulcent granules having a maximum average particle size such that the demulcent is not perceived by the human tongue, combining the demulcent granules with a sweetener and processing the sweetener and demulcent granules to form a comestible wherein the processing results in a comestible in which the demulcent granules are not fully hydrated upon formation of the comestible.

Yet another embodiment of the invention is directed to providing the comestibles described herein containing an effective amount of the demulcent granules to provide sore throat relief and in which the demulcent granules become fully hydrated upon ingestion.

An advantage of exemplary embodiments is that the use of a finely ground demulcent allows the inclusion of the delmucent without the need for pre-hydrating it in advance, saving time and costly manufacturing steps associated with subsequent de-hydration.

Another advantage is that when the tablet or other comestible is consumed, the finely ground demulcent hydrates directly in the consumer's mouth.

Other features and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following more detailed description of exemplary embodiments that illustrate, by way of example, the principles of the invention.
